 Rogue One is definitely a movie for Star Wars fans. The beginning of the movie is a bit slow yet it adds many new things to the lore. The ending of the movie is phenomenal and incredibly action-packed. Overall the movie is good and I recommend it especially if you are a Star Wars fan., 3.5,  Benjamin C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976376466/, January 18 2018, N/A

 It's easy to be leary of this movie for a number of reasons: when it takes place the introduction of new characters given the time period the obvious promotion of new merchandise (what? no flamethrower? kudos if you get the reference) the lackluster production despite critical acclaim of The Force Awakens and especially the fact that WE ALREADY KNOW what's going to happen. And yet we so very clearly also do not.... It's actually a breath of fresh air for the Star Wars universe. Whereas Force Awakens showered us with déjà vu in terms of plot character development acting and overall stale representation of not only the universe it's suppose to represent but simply as a movie in general Rogue One breaks out armed to the teeth guns blazing bright in all their visual glory. There are a few cheesy moments and there are some shameless plugs here and there (not to mention cringe- or some might probably say vomit-inducing CGI) which could easily bring down the score by half a star or more but is mostly forgivable by the fact that unlike the movie that came one year before you actually manage to develop sympathy for what happens to these characters. They have depth. Force Awakens was just too shallow and given that the story and action was so poorly scripted that you could tell what was going to happen several minutes before it did made for a horribly boring experience. Rogue One is entirely the opposite and a worthy addition to the Star Wars universe. Even if I still have a hard time buying the ending... I mean there's no reason he shouldn't have been able to... well you'll see when you watch it...., 3.5,  Brandon S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/975776806/, January 16 2018, N/A

 That's how you pay homage to a franchise and develop a character's backstory. There is not only obstacles to overcome but inner demons to overcome. The characters had well character. They all felt unique and the interactions between them didn't feel forced like in The Last Jedi. Also Jyn feels real. You care about her by witnessing her struggles. She's not a Mary Sue like Rey who easily overcomes all obstacles set to her. She doesn't always make the right decisions. She is human. I loved this movie., 5.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976988029/, January 16 2018, N/A

 As a kid it's no secret like many I was obsessed with Star Wars. I loved imaging the backstories of the characters and would create my own usually with my own action figures. Watching Rouge One the first entry outside of the official saga it's clear Gareth Edwards and Co are fans just like this.<br><br> Rouge one takes place between Episodes III and IV and focuses on Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) whose father Galen Erso is captured and forced to build the weapon known as The Death Star. At the start Jyn is a prisoner who's recruited by the Rebel Alliance to contact her father and track down the plans. She's joined by Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) a dedicated alliance officer with a checkered sense of loyalty K-2SO (Alan Tudyk) a re-programmed Imperial droid who provides much of the humor Bodi ( Riz Ahmed) a defecting Imperial pilot and Chirrut Imwe (Donnie Yen) and Baze Malbus one a mystical force-worshipper and another his loyal side-kick. What makes Rouge One such a unique experience is how it explores a period never before seen in the franchise. It examines the tyranny and corruption of the Empire's rule first-hand and how the galaxies withheld such oppression. We also see the inner workings of the Empire and it's politics via Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelson) as he attempts to utilize the Death Star for his own political advantage.<br><br> Where Rouge one also succeeds is in it's visuals and set-pieces. Gareth Edwards dutifully captures Luca's lived-in gritty aesthetic but still manages to contain a modern look to it. He handles the action with energy rawness but clarity as well. The final battle on the tropical island of Sarkiff is a highlight for the franchise and there's some truly excellent space battles as well. Rogue one's action also feels a bit more urgent than that of TFA the stakes still feel high despite knowing the outcome. <br><br>In terms of characters Rouge One may not be as iconic as TFA but it still manages to contain some effective performances and enjoyable characters. Felicity Jones shines as Jyn Erso providing her with the right amount of intensity vulnerability and humanity. Luna's Andor isn't the most charismatic addition but he instils him with an authority and ambiguity that makes him more fascinating. K-2SO is an achievement as Tudyk instills humor sympathy and cool into what could've been a Jar-Jar esque character. Mendelssohn is wonderfully over the top as Krennic he oozes arrogance and smarminess. Donnie Yen's Chirrut is a good mix of cheeky and mysterious and Jiang Wen's Blaze is a fitting foil. Riz Ahmed is fine as Bodi but I couldn't help feel his character was underutilized at times. Forrest Whitaker as Saw Gerrera is haunting and maniacal yet tortured as well (though I wish his screen-time was longer). Last but certainly not least yes Darth Vader is in this movie and yes he is just how you remembered him ( one scene toward the end had me in chills).<br><br> Crafting a spin-off from the Star Wars franchise was always going to be a risky move. Rouge One could've easily fallen on it's face or worse tarnished the legacy of A New Hope. Thankfully it manages to be an thrilling emotional and cinematic entry for the saga. It isn't perfect sometimes it could use more development of it's characters and it does lack some of TFA's heart and polish but like it's protagonists Rouge One is scrappy powerful and accomplishes it's missions despite the odds. My rating 8.5/10., 4.5,  Kenny B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/905844897/, January 15 2018, N/A

 The only decent Star Wars film to come out of Lucasfilms since the Disney buyout. Just about spot on for the setting with a few stupid plot holes unfortunately. The protagonist character Jynn Urso is annoying as hell the actress can't act she seems to have only two methods pouting stupidly and disappointed eyebrows. The character isn't at all feminine very much a male character played by a woman and done badly because she - and the writer who came up with the character - doesn't understand how men actually think and behave. It's a very annoying character but is the only major detraction from the film., 3.0,  Alan C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977055871/, January 15 2018, N/A

 (5.5 out of 6)- The force that binds the the unforceful rebellions for Episodes 4-9)<br>When we need to give hope for a peaceful galaxy among other worlds that we dont ever let 1 weapon govern us to follow an order but choose to live in order &amp peace with those in our galaxy willingly.

When what we don't see what hope we provide we see it comes from unlikely souls unchartered together to fight for what's right. When sometimes hope needs luck that keeps what can be manipulated and unmanipulated apart for a chance at hope.<br><br>When hope was built on those who long understood those intentions to begin the rebellion when higher places like the Senate were too slow (fog of war) to understand. When what little hope we want in our way when we are not ready we can't jeopardize interference. When we see where the Empire's hope resides when they acquire those to complete their plans. When what support others don't see is enough to risk lives we see hope diminish when some rather give into oppressors then fight for independence. When what we don't see is the force that binds those we don't see or what others don't care to see but the force sees hope in seeing. When the dark side of the force saw opportunity to strike the last remaining hope and those Holy Jedi places of hope we see the light side of the force on those side at the right time &amp place to keep hope alive in time to evacuate. When what hope we see others hold for the rebellion we see we are in a good place to die so the rebellion can live long. When what the force chooses to save rather then its own Jedi's we see a new hope that lies within the rebellion spirit. *Admiral Raddus &amp Ackbar<br><br>When what hope we rely on we see there is another hope that hides waiting to serve the Rebellions. When what places we see we are in are places that gives all hope for the Empire to win when plans tests new methods and technology is communicated to strike. When what spark of hope is ignited we see moments we go against the risks when others went against the risks to get that far to give hope a second chance. <br>*Obi Wan time in hiding after clone wars &amp Qui Quan.<br><br>When hope can dwindle when it's so far away to see what little hope remains rest on those who are left to fight.

When the force paves its way to give hope when few chances allows those to continue and give up. When the what hope we give to those we see we served our purpose. When what dark force tries to quickly claim any hope of salvaging we see all the brave souls that died to give a new hope for the Rebellion to fight., 4.5,  Galvy F, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/971257172/, January 14 2018, N/A
 I wasn't sure how much I would like this movie but I can definitely say it was a pleasant surprise. The acting and visuals were outstanding and the soundtrack was pretty good albeit not nearly as memorable as it was in the originals or prequels. The premise of the film was to answer a question that had remained unanswered until now - how were the Death Star plans obtained? The answer is that it was stolen by a ragtag group of rebels known as 'Rogue One'. The plans conveniently included a vulnerability in the Death Star deliberately placed by its chief architect who happened to be the father of the film's protagonist Jyn Erso. Although this film lacked character development and the plot sagged from time to time amazing action scenes great characters and solid comic relief kept the movie interesting the whole way through. The Darth Vader scene at the end was also simply epic., 4.0,  Chris M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977035493/, January 13 2018, N/A
 Rogue one is a movie that Star Wars fans deserved to have and thankfully it delivered. We see the Empire at the height of their power and how they affect the galaxy as a whole. We also see the rebellion and the sacrifices they have to make because of their desperation to defeat the Empire and restore the Republic. This is most definitely a war movie and it is gritty and action packed yet also delivers a compelling story. Each and every member of the Rogue One squadron has a role and each have a reason to be there. The movie follows Jyn Erso who has been tasked by the rebellion to retrieve her father an imperial scientist that unwillingly helped create the death star and bring him back to the rebellion. When their plan fails yet they learn of a way to retrieve the plans to the Empire's secret planet killer the death star they go to get said plans from a secret imperial base on a tropical planet. The entire movie is a wild ride that makes you care for the characters more and more and when they all sacrifice themselves for the rebellion it just makes the movie that much better. The entire last 45 to 30 minutes of this movie is absolutely thrilling and causes my heart the furiously beat each time I watch it. The simple fact of seeing the characters die yet knowing that their sacrifice is the only reason the rebellion will survive is simply amazing. Darth Vader is in this movie and he is certainly a treat for the audience yet is not the main focus of the movie. Director Krennic instead takes of the reigns of villainy in this movie and he is a pretty good villain but is annoyingly arrogant sometimes. Overall I believe this is the best Star Wars movie that we will get from Disney until 2020 (with hopefully an Obi-Wan movie) and will live on as a part of what makes Star Wars great., 4.5,  Ryan T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977036381/, January 13 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is an extraordinary "clever" movie -- in the best sense of the word. It manages to tell a fun fast story with interesting new characters and planets while weaving in so many aspects of Star Wars lore. The film fleshed out a remarkable backstory to the original Star Wars movie -- and to the entire original trilogy at that. The lead was great the supporting cast was solid and the droid character was totally likable. The appearance of Bail Organa who was too much neglected in the prequels was most welcome. The sand troopers a new bad guy and an appearance by Darth Vader himself. If there is one complaint one might say the film managed to be TOO epic as if outshining the original Star Wars film that chronologically followed it in the story's timeline. Eh maybe. But I can't dock the movie for that. This one really wowed in the theater. If Lucasfilm can deliver future Star Wars spin-offs of this caliber then there will be hope indeed..., 4.5,  Cooper S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977047022/, January 12 2018, N/A

 This movie is so much better than Episodes 7 and 8 because the evil portrayed is really threatening and believable. In particular the Death Star is presented as a mighty and awe-inspiring weapon. The Empire is really shown as a dark powerful force and there is little hope of resisting it. Yet the characters in Rogue One show real bravery by standing up to this threat and fighting against it even if it costs the ultimate price. The heroes show real bravery sacrificing themselves for a greater cause in the face of (nearly) impossible odds. This nicely sets up the scene for Episode 4. In stark contrast Episode 7 "The Force Awakens" ridicules e.g. the Death Star theme by introducing an even bigger death star without much explanation and then has it destroyed relatively easily within the same movie. Moreover the characters and atmosphere in Rogue One are consistent with Episodes 4-6. It fits in nicely in the Star Wars storyline something which CANNOT be said of Episodes 7 and 8., 5.0,  John W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/972494257/, January 6 2018, N/A

 Ho hum. Despite an attractive central performance by Felicity Jones and a Fort Knox worth of VFX this is just another tedious chapter in George Lucas' overrated and never-ending space soap. The plot is very simple: renegade Death Star designer Mads Mikkelsen has included a flaw in his design. Feisty daughter Felicity and her chums must exploit it. Yawn. A lot of very self-important RSC acting and zero humour., 3.0,  Simon T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/946436330/, January 31 2018, N/A

 Rogue One - great: starts slow gets faster and I was afraid of Vader again since 1977 (was in the premiere of Star Wars :-))<br>If the end of this great movie has and look at it right after Star Wars - a new Hope (for my premiere he's just Star Wars - god I'm old :-) it fits right away !!!<br>If you watch TFA and then TLJ what a shit. The last 3 minutes of TFA were brilliant - I had goose bumps - and wait 2 years to go on - and now?<br>It is not my Luke :-(<br><br>Mark please do not go to Disney no matter what you pay thank you and may the force be with you, 5.0,  Frank B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977079793/, January 30 2018, N/A

 Star Wars Rogue One<br> Personally I am not a Star Wars fan and haven't been involved with any of the Star Wars movies before watching Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. However I did begin watching the movie with an open mindset and viewed the movie from the perspective as a movie critic. I did end up enjoying this movie but it did not come off to me as any better than slightly above average. Next some features I liked and disliked about the movie. First the positives. I liked that there was plentiful amount of action in the movie although it was mostly all towards the end. Also I enjoyed the dominance and power Chirrut resembled with the force as savior throughout the movie even with his disability blindness. The character K-2 showed loyalty by remaining with the squad when he wasn't supposed to and donating his protection to them. I felt that this was admiring. What I disliked about the movie was that since I have not watched previous Star War movies I did not understand the character background and I would have liked to receive some in the course of the movie. Because of this I had to perform individual research to receive a better understanding of the characters in the movie for myself. When a character died in the movie their death scenes were quite overly dramatic. For instance the few characters' deaths I found most dramatic were Chirrut and Galen. Chirrut died in an explosion in the middle of a battle and while shots were being fired his friend made a big ordeal by risking his own life to stay with Chirrut while knowing he was dead. Jyn Erso Galen's daughter found her father on the ground laying to die after being in battle as well. She talked to him and was there when he died but the fact that made this scene so dramatic was that a mission of the entire movie was to get her father back from being captured. She also stayed and excessive amount of time with her deceased father with danger still surrounding her from the battle. Overall I found the movie entertaining but would have been far better if I had known the plots from the previous Star Wars movies., 3.5,  Cameron P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977080476/, January 29 2018, N/A
 Dear Readers<br>After watching Rogue One I had some likes and also some dislikes just as anyone would with any movie. I am not at all a Star Wars fan so going into this movie I thought that it would be very boring to me and that I would just completely hate the whole thing well that was not the case. While watching the movie I had some dislikes dislikes that included the characters. I wish that during the movie there would have been some type of explanation as to who certain people were and what their role was in the movie there were many characters that I was a slight bt confused about their role in the movie. I also wish that they would have explained what exactly the Rebellion was for me not being a Star Wars fan I had no idea what the Rebellion was and what they did. Another dislike that I had was Jyn in the movie she did experience some very traumatic events but by the looks on her face during these traumatic events it would seem as she was not very bothered by these events. When her mother died she did not show any emotion same as when her father died. When she did not show emotion when her father died I found that very unusual considering she had not seen him in fifteen years and then when she finally sees him for the first time he is killed. Like I had said at the beginning there were also some likes that I had. In all honesty I have always hated Star Wars and thought that it was stupid but after watching this movie it did not seem to be that bad although I have heard that it is not the same a the other movies. This movie was more like a war type of movie and I am very into action type of movies so I did enjoy that part of the movie even though some parts I did not understand why they were doing what they were doing. I do believe that Rogue One was a pretty good movie and there were many great things about the movie but there were also many things that could have been changed to make the movie better than it already was. I think that there should be a lot more explaining especially because many of the people who have watched the movie are not Star Wars fans just like me., 3.0,  Alyssa%20 M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977080310/, January 29 2018, N/A

 The ultimate Star Wars film for true Star Wars fans. After watching TFA I felt let down by the franchise but this was the film I wanted all along.

 After seeing an interview with Gareth Edwards in the BBC documentary "The galaxy Britain built" (see it on Youtube) I had to write this review. Edwards has Star Wars in his veins and it shows in Rogue1. What a catching movie and so much in line with the feel and touch of the first trilogy. For me this one comes close in quality of The empire strikes back. There are a few weak issues so I didn't give it full 5 stars but boy oh boy would I like to see Gareth Edwards making more Star Wars movies., 4.0,  Hans E, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/912306487/, January 20 2018, N/A

 While I've liked all three of the new Star Wars films this is probably my favorite one yet. It's a flawlessly crafted film that while still counts on nostalgia manages to tell a separate story with original characters that we meet for the very first time and we are never going to see again in this universe and still made me care about each one of them. I don't even have to comment on the production quality of it that's a given for a Disney tentpole film. But I was very surprised by the quality of the writing in this movie and how well established and personalised the characters were. The film adds up an interesting chapter in the saga that acts as some short of documentary set between the events of the prequel and the original trilogy., 5.0,  Andy M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977135871/, February 25 2018, N/A
 Rouge One does a fantastic job at making a separate prequel to the Star Wars saga and making it lead right into A New Hope.

 The new story is beautifully woven into the old gap between Revenge of the Sith and a New Hope.

 Rogue One finally explores a bit of the expansive Star Wars universe that novels/comics and games have been doing for years.<br><br>Does it do the franchise justice? In many and most ways yes. It's certainly a great addition to say the least as a standalone film and connecting film between "Revenge of the Sith" and "A New Hope"<br><br>A familiar story of a rag-tag group of unlikely rebels banding together for a common cause against a much larger impossible force... Rogue One sure follows the premise to a T. So much that a lot of the project would have fallen short if not for the established iconography of existing SW franchise material.<br><br>However that can only take the movie so far. The rest of it hinges on a colorful cast of characters that must deliver a compelling if not memorable story of their own and unfortunately some just do (K-2 Chirrut Baze) more than others. (Cassian Bodhi) The unevenness in their effective character presentation becomes more apparent during the climatic final acts when things start blowing up.<br><br>If more time was carefully spent making each of the key Rogue One cast stand out with quirks and interactions instead of the grandeur of action and explosions that was the Empire vs Rebel assault then the film would have benefited exponentially.<br><br>But as the film closes what we have is a very good "Star Wars Story" and nothing could ever take away from that. The nod at existing material didn't feel cheap (Except maybe C-3PO &amp R2D2 or CGI-face Tarkin) and the new characters felt real enough that their sacrifice mattered. This all on the backdrop of a serious War-drama without the hindrance of prophecies destiny and space knights/royalty? A big plus!, 3.5, , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/817023420/, February 17 2018, Super-reviewer
 So...On my first viewing of this film i was in love with it. I would of easily given it a 4/5 stars...But after a second viewing i realized it's problems. I realized it's messy story and more grim tone with just action on top of action without allowing me to care about any of the characters. It's an ok movie and you will probably think it's great good for you! But in my opinion this film's got me conflicted. I want to give it 2.5/5 but because i loved it the first time i felt i'll give it a 3, 3.0,  Christopher H, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977112305/, February 17 2018, N/A

 I found the film quite simply great we did not exactly need the info on how they got the plans it does not exactly add a whole new side of starwars it's just simply something nice. Although a few things I did not like is how instead of using the iconic AT-AT and stomrtroopers "it all had to be new" with the fancy AT-ACT and "Shoretroopers" which were all just silly add ons to the original trilogy.

 This first standalone Star Wars film has much familiarity to it - which is actually necessary and beneficial as it helps to reference key plot points and characters.

 With an incredibly emotional story and great characters Gareth Edwards provides one of the best 'Star Wars' films to date. Returning to the classic Star Wars story brought both nostalgia and a new vision of the rebellion. The characters were well developed and the darker ending brought back themes from 'The Empire Strikes Back'. I loved watching this film and it will always be one of my favourite cinematic experiences.

 "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" was an exciting sci-fi film that added well to the saga particularly to the original Star Wars film. The well-blended action originality and nostalgia made this film fun to watch from beginning to end. The performances by the characters were solid. Ben Mendelsohn's portrayal of Orson Krennic was my favorite performance of the film. He was a very believable intense villain with a decent amount of depth. However despite how much I enjoyed this film it definitely wasn't perfect.<br><br>My first issue with the film was the music. This had nothing to do with the fact that there was no opening crawl I actually appreciated that. I just thought that the music was sub-par in comparison to the rest of the saga. Now I don't think that the music was totally deplorable it just seemed like amateur work at certain points (i.e. the beginning). I also had a hard time investing in the majority of the characters. My least favorite character was Saw Guerrera. I couldn't stand his voice and really couldn't take hime seriously at all. In fact I disliked the majority of the first act with the exception of the very beginning and all the action which was great and explained Jyn's origins. My least favorite part was the giant-octopus scene. That was just weird and made Saw look like a complete joke.<br><br>Thankfully this movie really picked up in the second and 3rd act and totally saved it for me. Despite the iffy CGI I loved Tarkin's role in the film and Vader's scenes we're awesome. The final space battles we're a blast and looked very real with the blend of CGI/practical effects. The drama of the film also picked up in the third act which actually had me invested in the characters unlike the first act.<br><br>Overall "Rogue One" was a great film that really added to the original Star Wars narrative. When I left the theater the first thing I wanted to do was watch the original Star Wars film which for me meant that this new film was a job well done!, 3.5,  Jacob W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/968029823/, March 13 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a solid action packed star wars movie worthy of its place in the Star wars universe with a great collection of rag tag crew led by Felicity Jones this movie pulls us. A motley crew up against a monumental task it is reminiscent of "The Bridge on the River Kwai" impossible mission movies. It also solves one of the longest problems in the star wars story the vulnerability of the death star it fills in a gap with a great deal of wonderful movie magic. its climatic end is as sad as it is satisfying and the ending scenes as well as a few others that add the character of darth vader teases the heck out of the question will we see more of Darth Vader in the future? There some bad CGI Tarken but CGI is used to great effect in the battle scenes. Rogue One shows that the Star Wars universe is growing up the message of this movie is sometimes heros die in a good cause Its a grown up message for a grown up Star Wars., 3.5,  Oliver G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976979342/, March 10 2018, N/A

 Rogue One é realizado por Garth Edwards e tem lugar entre o episódio III (2005) e IV (1974) da saga Star Wars (1974 -). O maior elogio que posso fazer a este filme é que me fez apreciar ainda mais o episódio IV da série e o mundo de Star Wars em geral.<br><br>Devo dizer que este é um filme dedicado aos fãs da saga mas que deve também agradar a quem não acompanha fielmente a sua história. Contudo de forma a apreciar na totalidade esta experiência recomendo que tenham algum conhecimento dos restantes filmes ou até da banda desenhada.<br><br>No episódio IV sabemos que a Aliança Rebelde tem posse dos planos da Estrela da Morte assim como o conhecimento de uma pequena falha no seu projeto mas nunca soubemos como até então.<br><br>Em The Force Awakens (2015) Daisy Ridley esteve brilhante enquanto Rey agora Felicity Jones que interpreta Jyn Erso vem demonstrar que também ela é uma grande adição às estrelas femininas deste universo assim como ao elenco em geral. Ao longo do filme Jyn é uma das poucas personagens que tem de facto uma progressão individual. Sim não existe uma intenção em aprofundar as personagens neste filme e às vezes torna-se necessário para conseguirmos estabelecer um sentimento de pertença das mesmas na história ainda assim deixei-me comover em certos momentos.<br><br>Não há como não me comover quando a banda sonora de Michael Giacchino atinge o seu auge com apenas quatro semanas para a compor. A música em Star Wars é sentida como se de uma personagem se tratasse e embora neste filme não existam muitas faixas de destaque a composição é eficiente. Dê-lhe mais tempo e certamente que em futuros projetos o som será mais refinado.<br><br>O antagonista Director Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) é um vilão com uma progressão interessante ficando progressivamente mais enfurecido. Tem uma missão para concretizar e quer ficar com os merecidos créditos é um patife agradável de assistir. Também Donnie Yen que interpreta Chirrut Îmwe um ex-guardião de um templo dos Jedi que está bastante ligado à Força apresenta-se como uma personagem de relevo não só ao filme como à mitologia de Star Wars em geral. É uma personagem única num universo surpreendente.<br><br>K-2SO o novo robô foi uma presença necessária neste filme de guerra. Tudo desde os cenários às expressões e falas das personagens indicavam um clima de tensão e irritabilidade. Até mesmo a Aliança Rebelde por vezes tinha de cometer atos que não os deixavam muito orgulhosos. Este robô não só ajudou a harmonizar o ambiente com o seu sentido de humor sarcástico como também a monotonia que por vezes se sentia. Não de uma forma penosa ou nada que se parecesse mas à medida que o filme progredia mais sentíamos o que podíamos esperar dele.<br><br>O terceiro ato foi um dos melhores que a saga oferece. Principalmente os últimos trinta minutos que foram uma (muitas!) explosão de ação com a narrativa dividida em três pontos principais. Todas as cenas prenderam ao ecrã e fizeram-me estar investido no filme. No final há uma sequência em particular que certamente irá entrar no pódio dos melhores momentos de toda a saga. É um final digno e apropriado para um dos meus filmes preferidos de Star Wars.<br><br>8/10, 4.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976856229/, March 10 2018, N/A

 I liked it a lot but......<br>This movie was really well done and tells an interesting story about how the plans for the Deathstar in A New Hope were obtained by the Rebels. It's visually stunning has good pacing great locations great acting and has the feel of a real Star Wars movie. This movie proves that you can have compelling stories and characters you can get attached to in the Star Wars universe without lightsabres and the Jedi. And I guess this is also precisely why there is a mild feeling of dissatisfaction after watching this movie (spoilers): every main character in this movie dies. I watched this movie in the theater with my son (who was 10 at the time) and he loved it until everyone died and hated it afterward. When it came out on Netflix I could not get him to watch it with me again for that reason so I watched it last week when he was not there. My personal conclusion after watching it again is that it's a 5 star movie minus 1 star cause I just don't like it when everyone dies. I guess that's also why we haven't bought this movie or any related merchandising., 4.0,  Farth D, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977150277/, March 6 2018, N/A

 So far this is the best Star Wars film that Disney has made. It's so good it's in my top 3 Star Wars films: Ep. 3 Rogue Ep. 5. Very unique very original ties very well into the Star Wars universe.

 where are Kyle Katarn Jan Ors Havet Storm...? the true operation Skyhook. I feel that this movie doesn't tell me a story but that it should be done in silly actions like climbing a tower connecting a cable and other cliffhangers. The heavy stuff in getting the politically correct. The elimination of the other protagonists makes almost no difference to me because you don't empathize with them.

 I was motivated to write this review and give Rogue One 5 stars by the abject failure of a dumpster fire that is The Last Jedi. It made me appreciate Rogue One even more after seeing that other train wreck.<br><br>Rogue One is everything a long time Star Wars fan like me could have wanted: Smart plot somewhat dark with interesting characters and spectacular planets and effects. <br><br>Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy obviously wanted to shove feminism down our throats with The Last Jedi but they should have looked at Rogue One to see what a well thought out and developed female lead looks like. Jyn Erso is awesome. Not awesome in the perfect Mary Sue way Rey is but awesome in that she is a well acted well developed and personable character that has a reason to be where she is other than just having a vagina. As a parent of a young child I definitely sympathized with both her and Galen Erso. It wasn't super deep or even original but it WORKED and it made me CARE about her and UNDERSTAND why she was saddled with this heavy burden to get the Death Star plans. It made sense.<br><br>The humor was spot on. Not shoved in your face like the infantile prank call that opened up The Last Jedi but something low key yet hilarious like K2SO dryly saying he can survive in space while his friends will die. Its smart and funny.<br><br>Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy obviously wanted General Hux from the Last Jedi to be the bumbling incompetent white male they hate so much. But again they didnt need to go very far to find a GOOD white male villian. Rogue One's Krennic is pretty much what you think of when you think of an evil Imperial officer. Completely devoid of any good personality traits and is an ambitious conniving Imperial to the core. Hes up there with Darth Vader as my favorite Star Wars villain.<br><br>Seeing how the Death Star was built and the back stabbing politics between Krennic and Tarkin (who looked AMAZING in CGI in my opinion. My wife didn't even know it was CGI!!) was a treat to Star Wars nerds like me.<br><br>I really loved pretty much everything about this movie especially after watching the Last Jedi. To me the Last Jedi killed most of my long time interest in Star Wars. Rogue One is giving me hope that the stand alone Star Wars Story/anthology movies will fly under the radar of the incompetent pretentious toxic touch of Kathleen Kennedy and allow more creative freedom to the directors assigned., 5.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977072144/, February 28 2018, N/A

 {Spoilers} <br><br>Two stars only because Vader kicked ass for 45 seconds and I got to see some AT-AT walkers again in modern CGI glory. Other than that I thought the movie was slow and non-inspiring. You could literally walk in late almost 1/2 way through and been able to not miss much and pick up the obvious story she was abandoned and somehow ended up with this put together crew. Sure she and Andor were tragic hero's but to me this story been done so many times. War movie with hero's sacrifices power hungry dictators and the rise up from the gallows., 2.5,  Scott N, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/965449936/, February 27 2018, N/A
 This is my favorite out of all the new star wars movies. Its the only one that actually made me emotionally involved. I almost cried when certain characters died. Sometimes it starts to drag a little but HOLY CRAP...the last half hour is insanely thrilling. And vader gets lots of screen time...including one of the best scenes in any star wars movie. it perfectly blends into the 1977 "A new hope" and young princess Leia makes an apperance. All in all this is a really good movie and I will be rewatching it along with the original 3 many more times., 4.0,  Jeremy W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/937855956/, February 27 2018, N/A

 If you expect a "Star Wars" movie to make you freak out like a teen with amazing lightsaber duels or just want a highly Force-related plot "this is not the movie you're looking for".<br><br>But if you like me would enjoy a war movie in space with astonishing special effects and a climax so well done it keeps you on the edge of your seat then get ready to see one of the most beautiful and well made battles in space not only from the Star Wars universe but in the entire Sci-Fi production of the last few years.<br><br>Plot is simple and a true fan will already know how this is going to end even if a couple of minor plot twists here and there will surprise him/her. <br><br>Unfortunately it has quite negative aspects too: to link with characters like Jynn and Cassian may be a little harsh and the first minutes are quite hard to follow if you're not paying enough attention.<br>But just the last five minutes are already worth the ticket., 5.0,  Giovanni G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977136039/, February 25 2018, N/A
 The film's greatest strengths are Alan Tudyk as K-2SO and spectacular sound and visual effects.<br><br>Its greatest weakness is inevitability.<br><br>Didn't we learn in 1999 2002 and 2005 that prequels aren't a great idea both in general and particularly in this universe? Where is the room for surprises or suspense in a film whose ending has been known for almost forty years?<br><br>A film like Titanic can work even though we know that the ship is going to sink by making us care about the characters and by making their individual stories matter against the backdrop of the inevitable. Rogue One doesn't do a great job of either.<br><br>The characters are likable but underdeveloped. The cast give solid performances especially Tudyk as K-2SO and Mendelsohn as the primary antagonist Krennic. Through careful use of archived footage a few minor characters from the original film return and a few more are easily recast due to makeup masks or effects (most prominently Darth Vader). But more significant by far Grand Moff Tarkin returns through impressive CGI some of the best ever seen but still scraping the edge of the uncanny valley from time to time. Some of these work with the plot (Tarkin Vader) some fit in practically seamlessly (rebel pilots) some are jarringly forced cameos for no apparent reason ("You'd best watch yourself").<br><br>The technical side of things is all handled as well as we've come to expect from Star Wars. From droids to ships to blasters to walkers to the Death Star itself every piece of tech feels real as do the alien species and the worlds we visit.<br><br>What sets this apart from the Star Wars we know is primarily the tone and the scale. These aren't the epic heroes who will save the galaxy this isn't a story of triumph over great evil. This is a handful of rebels whose names will be a footnote in the Journal of the Whills whose greatest achievement is transmitting a message to the right people at the right time. It's less Space Opera and more War Movie. And that's a good thing. It's a big galaxy far far away and there's lots of ways to look at it and parts to look at that haven't been touched yet. There's no need to rush on to the next generation if we still have interesting stories to tell in this era.<br><br>My favourite part of the Star Wars Expanded Universe was the X-Wing series which ignored the big heroes and focused on a couple of squadrons of fighter pilots. Aside from giving the authors more freedom (since Lucasfilm had strict rules about what you could do with characters like Leia but not so much for Hobbie Klivian and Wes Janson) this also meant that the stories tended to be more personal. The story of Myn Donos's grief depression and PTSD or of Tycho Celchu's struggle to clear his name aren't the epic Adventures Of Luke Skywalker. But they still matter.<br><br>That sadly is where Rogue One falls short. The characters' stories don't matter much. They don't grow or change through the story. Nobody overcomes their mercenary nature like Han in ANH. Nobody redeems themself for past failure like Lando. Nobody wrestles with the temptation of the Dark Side They don't have individual stories they just have one shared adventure. Baze particularly is so underwritten that beyond "Chirrut's friend with the big gun" it's hard to say anything about him and Bodhi is little better.<br><br>Still the plot progresses pretty reasonably. If you can ignore a plot hole or two it's an entertaining adventure. The pace flows fairly well and there's action aplenty without it feeling forced or gratuitous. It falters only slightly when a few moments toward the end feel like the obstacles in their path have been placed there fairly arbitrarily (eg why would the controls for transmitting from the antenna be so far away from the controls for aligning the antenna to transmit?). But there's the underlying unmistakable air of inevitability. We know how this is going to end. The film even seems to surrender to it surprisingly early cutting the team and some of their allies off from escape behind an impenetrable shield. You aren't watching to see if things will happen you're watching to see how they will happen.<br><br>SW Fans will get a kick out of returning to the original era for the first time in a long time and of seeing Vader once again as the terrifying Sith Lord rather than a whiny impulsive youth.<br><br>It's a smooth and enjoyable ride and spectacular but does feel a little hollow and predictable., 3.5,  ratimir g, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/900878199/, March 22 2018, N/A

 The best Star Wars movie from a visual perspective. The story is good because it's gritty and actually tries to build credit with the audience. The biggest effect the movie has on the Star Wars universe is that it shows what the new trilogy (episodes 8 and 9) could have been instead of the mindless mess that they new trilogy has become. Apparently Disney can make a half-way decent Star Wars movie when they really want to. What a shame they've blown it with Episode 8 and particularly the disaster that was Episode 9., 4.0,  Mark S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977000071/, March 20 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a good spinoff. Originality is there acting is there and the visuals are there. The story itself though is kind of........ not.

 This movie had many flaws with pacing and it felt very slow at times and dragging on all of the scenes seemed cut together in no manner that felt like it benefited the story. The characters are not all too likable except brief character building moments that are cut short for a action sequence. All of the interesting story beats are not monopolized on and it seems that they focused too much on making a movie that gave you information and not a story. This entire movie is based on a single throw away line from a character in another Star Wars movie and it shows. The writing has many good moments and other terrible ones I enjoyed all of the acting especially that of Diego Luno who was a very good part of the movie unfortunately none of the characters sold the team aspect of the movie and only seemed like a bunch of stranger who ran into each other this theme was still present at the end of the film. I thought this was an okay film but the potential was wasted with many of the scenes there are many amazing moments but overall the film lacks a good story and character development in my opinion. This is still a very watchable film and you will find out very interesting things about the Star Wars universe you didn't know and some of them seem as if you didn't even ask but are given the answer anyway. You can tell the creators are real Star Wars fans though and it is very well made the visuals are stunning but it seems at times whole sequences were cut short and that parts of the movie just went missing on the cutting room floor which is very unfortunate for a promising film like this. You should still watch this film if you enjoy Star Wars movies though but I might say it's not for the average viewer but you might like it if you're into sci-fi., 2.5,  Josh K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/931853787/, March 16 2018, N/A

 Very underwhelming knowing that it's a Star Wars film but is fun at time. K2SO is so much fun and Chirrut Imwe is a badass. The villain Krennec was very bland but the troopers were well designed and well utilized. Jones was okay as Jyn Erso but wasn't as heroic as I predicted.

 Enjoyable genre movie-making that answers the question "How did the rebels get the Death Star plans?" and thus serves as a prelude to Episode 4: A New Hope which most of us know to be just Star Wars (1977). Indeed we are treated to cameos by Princess Leia (young Carrie Fisher digitally) C3PO &amp R2D2 (briefly) and Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) as well as some guy in Peter Cushing make-up. (Jimmy Smits is here but I don't know why since I gave Episodes 2 and 3 a miss). The real focus here is on new characters however. It seems Mads Mikkelsen's Galen Erso designed the Death Star for the Empire under pressure even after they killed his wife and sent his daughter into hiding (with Forest Whitaker of the Rebels). As revenge he put "the flaw" into the machinery that the plans reveal. Years later his daughter Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) becomes convinced to get those Death Star plans along with Diego Luna Donnie Yen Wen Jiang Riz Ahmed and a deadpan robot named K-2SO. Aussie Ben Mendelsohn is the chief baddie (apart from D. V.). It's all action from start to finish with the typical Star Wars blend of smart-ass dialogue bonding and sentimentality and good vs. evil shoot-em-ups. There are attempts to create distinct characters but they are not much more than pieces on the chess board here totemic though some may be. In the end the film looks good (CGI) and director Gareth Edwards keeps things moving at a good pace (however like many films today it is probably a bit too long). Conclusion: if you like the franchise this is well worth your time., 3.5,  Art S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/792064900/, March 15 2018, N/A

 Wooden unlikable characters and a bizarrely incoherent plot make this a pretty bad movie. I get the sense that this movie was ruined in the editing process because there are many sudden jumps in the plot that simply don't make sense unless there were scenes that got deleted.

 Like many of the books based on it's characters Rogue One is a very uneven film. The first portion stretching from Jyn in her cell to the destruction of Jedha is all over the place and suffers from bad pacing and remnants of reshoots.

 A true prequel to the original Star Wars Rogue One is a thrilling sci-fi adventure that tells the story behind the Rebel's first victory. When an Imperial pilot defects with important information about a new weapon called the Death Star he's captured by a fringe resistance fighter named Saw Gerrera leading the Rebels to seek out one of Gerrera's former followers in order to find him and get the information from the pilot. The cast is fairly strong and delivers some good performances particularly Alan Tudyk who does an excellent job voicing the droid K-2SO (giving him a fun personality). And director Gareth Edwards does an impressive job at filming the action and capturing the scope of the battle sequences. Additionally the special effects are extraordinarily well-done and allow for a surprising cameo. However the score by Michael Giacchino is rather weak and the two lead characters aren't that charismatic. Yet overall Rogue One is an exciting and action-packed film that bridges the two Star Wars trilogies., 4.0, , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/906395584/, February 3 2018, Super-reviewer

 The use of CGI to "resurrect" a few characters doesn't really work but otherwise this is a satisfying saga addition with engaging action compelling characters and a linear narrative.

 After the success of The Force Awakens this film was always going to have to pull something special out of the bag to even stand along side of it and luckily for us it has just done that The first 20 minutes was very slow and it kind of got me worried about the rest but thinking about it I think it's because we are introduced to a brand new cast but after them first 20 minutes are out the way it gets better and better and hardly slows down It has a great story and it also answers a few questions that never really got answered in A New Hope The action was great fun and the best I've seen in the series and the effects were first class I can't comment on the 3D as I watched the 2D version but I don't think the 3D would of been worth paying extra for Although the story and cast were very different to what we're used to we still have 2 scenes with Darth Vader and a quick cameo from C3PO and R2-D2 and if you read the synopsis you will kind of guess what happens but even so I was quite surprised with how the final scenes played out Also the ending scene which is set moments before Episode IV with a fantastic CGI Princess Leia were great but also very emotional as the day I watched this at the cinema sadly Carrie Fisher passed away the day before so the ending of this movie was so much more emotional than intended This movie has just proven that The Force Awakens wasn't a fluke and we can expect great things in the future for the Star Wars franchise., 4.5, , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/788614323/, December 28 2017, Super-reviewer

 Rogue One further expands the Star Wars mythology while setting up a refreshingly grittier tone than the rest of the saga in a riveting action packed film with incredible cgi as well as emotional impact., 4.0,  Nikos R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/930891365/, December 28 2017, N/A
 The CGI is as in most blockbusters amazing but that doesn't save the movie from being too cliche. Uninteresting dialogue even though the characters are easy to like. The action isn't innovative which leads to the viewer being bored after ten minutes of non stop spaceship battles and big explosions. It's a movie that only Star Wars fans might enjoy by replacing it's lack of heart with nostalgia., 2.0,  Luisa B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977008386/, December 28 2017, N/A

 There is little of substance in this movie and it drags at the beginning horribly. But the outstanding design at least decent performances and beautiful imagery elevate it as a spectacle despite the lack of depth.<br><br>"The way I like to work is you try and come up with visual milestones of like well I'd love to see this and I'd love to see this and I'd love to see this - I'm not sure how they connect.

 Takes a while to get going and all the planet names and hopping is a little confusing to begin with but the story is nearly pulled together.

 Rogue One was a ride and a fun one for the most part. It didn't bother with the slow-paced filler scenes. It just picks up with where the action is. Script and characters were engaging. Yet some were downright annoying. Saw Guerra and the mumbling monk sucked. They were generally unecessary characters. Tarkin was an anal addition who chewed scenes. They didn't over-use Vader. For the most part it all worked. But the choice to kill off the cast seemed to also give license to establish no real comraderie. It provided a somewhat depressing movie. They should've kept some. If this was like a SW Vietnam-inspired tribute someone needed to remind them there were some who came back from that war. <br><br>RO soundtrack was fantastic. And though the final battle composed the whole end of the movie it dragged as to the purpose. The final scenes were beautifully handled. The DV ending almost looked tacked on but they did it so well it's a welcome addition.<br><br>Read about several different versions for how they wanted to end RO in such a way as to explain why Andor and Erso weren't in subsequent episodes without killing them off. This was stupid. All they needed to do was show them take off in a shuttle show the base explode and the vehicle smoking in descent... then cut away. After the rebel ship escapes cut back to a devastated landscape and a crash-scene. They wouldn't be able to get off the land and no one would know they're there. At least not for a while ...problem solved (sigh)., 3.5,  Henry K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976952892/, December 30 2017, N/A

 Like many people I went to rewatch this after being let down by The Last Jedi and boy did I forget how much I enjoyed this film. It's basically a war movie set in the Star Wars universe and as such isn't limited by the trappings of a Star Wars movie (no opening scrawl! No Jedi or lightsaber battles - the closing scene is an exception but more on that later) and I remember thinking this film represented so much potential for the Star Wars license now out of Lucas's restrictive hands - imagine an entire universe of Star Wars stories being told on the big screen without being tied down by the restrictions of a main "Star Wars" Episode. Rogue One is a great start to this Anthology universe.<br><br>Spoilers abound!<br><br>THE GOOD: <br>Yes there are a lot of characters and some have criticised that we don't have time to get to know them before they all die horribly and hence the deaths aren't emotional for us - but I didn't feel that way. I thought the characters worked - Jyn was a strong female protagonist who clearly had chemistry with her father Galen Cassian served his purpose and Chirrut and Baze were standouts to me (even though a great many stormtroopers had to play into the stereotype and die stupidly to establish Chirrut's awesomeness). I fell for K2SO - he grew on me and his end was tragic (perhaps biased by my fondness for Alan Tudyk and his character's equally tragic end on 'Serenity'). <br><br>The crew's deaths worked for me because I felt I grew to know them enough over the course of the movie to care about them - I know this wasn't the case for everyone. When Cassian tells Bodhi the pilot "You're our only way out of here" before the final battle on Scarif I thought this was going to be another happy-ending no-stakes Rebel tale - didn't see the grim ending coming until K-2SO took a blaster bolt to the chest.<br><br>Darth Vader in the hallway at the end - sweet Christmas. I swear there was a mass orgasm in the cinema when that scene happened and I'm not ashamed to admit I was part of it. Yes shameless fan service - but it worked very very well. The OG stormtroopers Imperial sets and the Death Star also scratched many nostalgia itches for me.<br><br>Original Trilogy cameos - I felt these were more than fan service since Rogue One was supposed to be a prequel to A New Hope. I'll admit I'm big on nostalgia so all the cameos worked for me - I was overjoyed at Grand Moff Tarkin and even loved Dr Evazan and Ponda Baba (more poignant as Dr Evazan's actor passed away shortly after my viewing).<br><br>Finally the cinematography in this film was amazing (one of The Last Jedi's strongest points as well). The wide shots of the Star Destroyer over Jedha City the Scarif beach the Death Star ominously peeking over the horizon the view of Scarif from space through the Rebel flagship's floor the space battle itself - I found it all breathtaking.<br><br>THE BAD:<br><br>Krennic as a villain served his purpose but I felt he was underused. In the iTunes extras director Gareth Edwards explains he couldn't make Vader or Tarkin the villain because they had plot armour and clearly survive the movie - this is probably why they had to cook Krennic up. Mendelsohn does a good job but is clearly upstaged by Vader and Tarkin whenever they are onscreen.<br><br>Forest Whitaker was wasted as Saw Guerrera I feel - this character has a far more interesting arc in the Clone Wars and Rebels animated series which explores his fanaticism and his hatred for what the Empire did to his sister. In this film he was a plot device.<br><br>I'm all for diversity in film - but while watching this film I could tell that the diversity was inserted on purpose. Not a bad thing but it felt a little forced.<br><br>As with all Star Wars films suspension of disbelief is required - stormtroopers still can't shoot for nuts a whole battalion of them are defeated by a blind man with a stick in the beginning but by the end of the film they are a credible threat to a well-armed band of Rebels.<br><br>THE VERDICT: A thoroughly enjoyable film and well worth Disney buying the franchise in my opinion (The Last Jedi notwithstanding). Spells a lot of potential for future Star Wars Anthology films - here's hoping Solo lives up to the mark., 4.5,  Aaron S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977013707/, December 29 2017, N/A
 PLOT SPOILERS THROUGHOUT<br><br>After avoiding reviews and spoilers for this film I went to see 'Rogue One' a few weeks after it had been released fearing a repeat of last year's Star Wars: A New Hope Redux. <br>I was thoroughly disappointed one could not help but hear promises of a far more adult and gritty installment in the Star Wars universe but this was not delivered.<br><br>I found the majority of the characters to be two-dimensional with no attempt made to flesh out their personalities or make the audience invest in them emotionally. This really stood out towards the end of the film when some main cast members died and the sudden switch to slow-motion and the change in tone of music showed me that this was meant to be a tragic moment but having no attachment to the characters I didn't really care.<br><br>Disney should note that "Having a large gun" or "Being Blind and repeating a clunky mantra regarding the force" do not constitute personalities.<br><br>Far too many characters are introduced with far too little time being spent on them to justify their inclusion. Krennic (one of the few characters who's name I remember) did far too little during the film to justify the time spent dwelling on his character and could have died far earlier on in the film as he only served as a tedious and easily defeated obstacle towards the end of the film. The time that Jyn and he spend 'monologuing' with each other could have been put to better use. Come to think of it his role could have been filled by a more established star wars villain such as Grand Moff Tarkin who has real pedigree as a Star Wars Villain and would not have required such a forced and uncompelling introduction. <br>(Peter Cushing has sadly not fared well since his death and his rigid and expressionless CGI corpse suffered badly from the effects of the 'Uncanny-Valley').<br><br>Forest Whitaker was sadly wasted with his character being killed after only a few short minutes of screen time and could have been completely omitted from the film without his characters absence being noted and perhaps improving the pacing of the film. What little exposition there was for his character (that he was too extreme for the rebels) did little to help.<br><br>It seems that there was a great more to this film that was either planned but never shot or was cut to achieve a shorter running time and a lower age rating. Thankfully some of this footage seems to have been the more cringe worthy Jyn Erso lines from the trailer.<br><br>Again like The Force Awakens this film took every opportunity to remind you that "weve seen the OT too" and had too many jarring and unnecessary references to the original films including a pointless and frankly stupid scene involving two characters from A New Hope who happen to spout the same dialogue as they did in a cantina some 40 years ago. <br><br>The best (or most promising moments) were<br><br>The insurgency in Jedha this was gritty and showed a vastly outnumbered and technologicaly inferior resistance group fighting a dirty and relatable war against an occupying force. This part of the film had great potential and would have served well as a means of 'fleshing out' some of the main cast.<br><br>The batle at the relay station where the rebels storm an imperial facility to steal the Death Star plans. This could have been vastly improved however if they had not insisted on cutting away from a gritty boots-on-the-ground firefight to scenes of a friendly robot sorting through an overly compicated Imperial filing cabinet.<br><br>Finally for me the best scene of the film was...<br><br>Darth Vader thoroughly F'ing the S**t out of a squad of Rebel soldiers with all the skill and savagery we have come to expect. This scene was brutal to the point where it seemed to be taken from a different but much better film. As awesome as this scene was it could have only ever been what it is an epic finale. <br><br>Perhaps a load of deleted scenes or a Directors Cut will be released that can fix this film. I hope that Disney didn't wrest control of the Star Wars universe from George Lucas' well meaning but terribly misguided hands just to allow this...<br><br>Edit:<br>A fan edit of the film called 'Rogue One: The Battle of Scarif' is indeed a much better version of the original., 2.0,  H R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977013570/, December 29 2017, N/A

 Rogue One definitely surprised me when I first saw it in theaters. I wasn't really thrilled by The Force Awakens but Rogue One's originality and risk-taking helped me enjoy it!<br><br>Director Gareth Edwards does a great job of making you feel like you're back in the Original Trilogy era. The cinematography and the slightly gritty landscape of planets like Jedha and Wobani also add to that feel. Despite the little development they had I found most of the characters in Rogue One to be extremely compelling even though we only got to see them for a brief time. My favorites were the possibly Force-sensitive Chirrut Imwe and the ambitious Imperial director and main antagonist Orson Krennic who is played brilliantly by Ben Mendelsohn. I should also add that all of the actors in this film are great.<br><br>Rogue One does seem a little slow on the first viewing but that's mainly because the first act is built on introducing characters. Once the action starts around 30 minutes into the film (just an estimate) it really picks up. The film ends with the best space battle and perhaps the best ground battle Star Wars has seen to date. The D-Day inspired beaches of Scarif were a great pick for the final act.<br><br>Unlike The Force Awakens which relies on nostalgic references and dramatic cameos of Original Trilogy characters Rogue One manages to be a good film all its own. It has a strong cast of characters interesting locations and expands and improves the first Star Wars film in way I didn't think possible., 4.5,  Dillon J, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976972737/, December 24 2017, N/A

 B- (80/100)<br><br>Rogue One is a good Star Wars movie. It's also just a pretty good MOVIE despite a stumbling core in its script characters etc. It's not perfect but it is highly entertaining and impressively made and to me it fits right in with the original six films. Let's get into it.<br><br>STORY: Branching off from the Skywalker story and focusing on this particular point of time in the Star Wars universe is a plus. It goes in an interesting direction for sure being a war film as well as a space adventure film. 4/4<br><br>SCRIPT: The script has some great moments and dialogue and also some cheesy ones. But what Star Wars movie doesn't? My only main problem with the script is the structure and pacing. It feels like there's no first or third act but rather Rogue One feels like one big action sequence after another and it just kind of goes from point A to point B without really developing like a proper screenplay should. The plot made sense but nobody really grew and so the story kind of didn't either. But I'm torn because although there's a lack of story and character progression a lot of the dialogue and tone felt authentically like that of the original six Star Wars movies and not without being its own thing which I really appreciated. And they incorporated a lot of the universe as it already stands to help move the along such as Vader and Tarkin--despite how Tarkin looks in the film. 3/4<br><br>CHARACTERS: They characterize Jyn Erso well by establishing her connection to her father the creator of the Death Star. The problem of the Death Star having a weakness in the first place is even fixed by these characterizations which is clever and rightly praised by critics. Everyone else in the movie is OK but not as compelling. Maybe Bodie and Cassian Andor but they're not quite as three-dimensional. No character lacks motivation or purpose-- K-2SO provides some humor Saw Gerrera has an interesting backstory and Krennick just wants credit for his work etc. But no one really grows. All that matters is this thing they have to do and they do it and they're just disposable characters in the Star Wars universe then again they could only do so much to serve this story which is kind of supposed to be more of the focus than the characters but to a fault. 2/4<br><br>DIRECTION: It's a well-directed movie it's exciting good action. Not great choices in casting and performances but Gareth Edwards had the right ideas. 3/4<br><br>PERFORMANCES: These are some of the most half-assed performances since Episode III. Force Awakens had some good acting from Harrison Ford Adam Driver John Boyega Andy Serkis and Domnhall Gleeson. A lot of that comes from star power I suppose with Ford Serkis and Oscar Isaac. The only two performances I kind of liked here were Diego Luna Mads Mickelsen and Alan Tudyk. Maybe even the guy who plays the defector pilot. Everyone else tends to stumble especially Jones with her accent. They're nowhere near Phantom Menace level but the performances left something to be desired. I think that's also due to the casting. 2/4<br><br>CINEMATOGRAPHY: Rogue One is beautifully shot gritty not slick like the new Saga entries. Great tone and texture. Lovely angles. 4/4<br><br>EDITING: Some scenes and lines of dialog I would have cut or used different takes for as well as shorted a few shots. The pacing is also due to the editing but it does make sense. What else can you do with a meh script? 3/4<br><br>SOUND DESIGN: Star Wars is know for fine sound. Here is no exception although Vader sounded a little different but whatever. 4/4<br><br>MUSIC: Better than Episode VII Michael Giacchino transported me to that galaxy better than John Williams in Episode VII. What even... 4/4<br><br>ACTION / SPECIAL EFFECTS: Because the characters are not that interesting the action scenes loses a little bit of power. But on their own they're technically impressive and thoroughly entertaining. The CGI is great for the most part but Tarkin takes me out of the movie. Why not just recast him? Or replace his role with Darth Vader's so we can get a little more of him? Not a fan of the choice they made there. But he's only in it for a little bit so it's not that bad. 3/4<br><br>Tota points: 32/40<br>80/100<br>B-<br>______<br>Overall Rogue One is a better Star Wars movie in tone texture and authenticity than Episodes VII and VIII its script and characterization flaws weaken the compelling story and robs it of a higher place in the saga but it remains a fun and entertaining entry in the series., 4.0,  Movie R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976845912/, December 27 2017, N/A
 Rogue One is one of my favorite Star Wars movies (the beginning is to fast sometimes until we arive at Yavin 4) Next to EPII and EPIII. I didn't hate the prequals (EP II and EPIII) like a lot of fans do. I was in my early 20's when the movies where in cinema's . For the orginal ones I was to young when these movies entered cinema's. An old primary schoolfriend intoduced these movies to me on VHS. Gareth Edwards did a very good job for this movie, 4.0,  Jeroen%20 L, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976986065/, December 27 2017, N/A
 After seeing The Last Jedi I now realize how much I love Rogue One (R1). In the short span of one move characters were introduced in R1 that I cared about. It is a great example of how to do it right as opposed to how to do it WRONG in The Last Jedi.<br><br>The lead character Jyn has some back story as to why she has her skills. She's clearly the heart of the movie and the inspiration for the entire final act leading those who crave a leader with vision and a cause worth fighting. And she does it through example and hope... not through transparent feminist tropes and cliche emasculation of every authority figure around her.<br><br>The tone was right. The framing of the individual stories within a complex broader epic Star Wars universe was right. The special effects were good.<br><br>It even had humor but in restraint and in a way that seemed suited to the moment.<br><br>I didn't see many plot holes... and the ones there were seemed to not disrupt the enjoyment of the movie. <br><br>All around Rogue One is everything I wish The Last Jedi had been., 4.0,  L A, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976998628/, December 27 2017, N/A

 The first of many more spin offs in the future for the saga Rogue one not only plays well at nostalgia it gives us a dark story that rivials empire and revenge of the sith in terms of its meaning. With also a grand return from darth vader who steels the scenes he's in rogue one is a great new prequel in the star wars saga though i wish we got to see the team interact more with each other each has a weight to them and something to prove and it makes the ending all the more sad but ends as a end of this story and the start of everything else in a galaxy far far away., 4.0,  Daniel S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/922085619/, December 26 2017, N/A
 Love love love this film. The grittiness of a war movie with the magic of Star Wars Rogue One is a beautiful blend that just plain works. Yes the character development is lacking but like no Star Wars movie before this film demonstrates the sacrifices and compromises that come with war. What's more the battle sequences are some of the best you'll find in a Star Wars film and the Vader scene alone that closes out the movie is one of the most thrilling in recent memory., 4.0,  Ian Y, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/782394271/, December 26 2017, N/A

 A superb entry in the Star Wars series. The Force Awakens saved the franchise because it remembered Star Wars films must first be exciting and action-oriented (unlike the didactic and slow prequels). Rogue One is exciting action-oriented and smart in ways that deepen the themes of the original trilogy. Donnie Yen's character for example is a monkish devotee of the Force and he chants the mantra "I am one with the Force and the Force is with me" to give himself strength when he needs it. Touches like that make this film worthy of the originals and in continuity with them clearly this entry will stand up to repeated viewings as Star Wars Empire and Return of the Jedi do even today. Finally after all these years a good Star Wars movie that is also truly a good movie. Hurrah!, 4.0,  Geoffrey C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976182358/, December 26 2017, N/A

 This installment of what could be called episode 3.5 is very different then the prequels of the previous decade. A great cast great story better cinematography than any other Star Wars film. It sets itself apart which is what the franchise really needs. It was such a delight to see a prequel compliment the original film so well. I give this film an extra half a star for exceeding my expectations. I am not a fan of episodes 1-3 or 7-8.

 I loved Rogue One. I like the idea of a parallel story that gives deeper insight into the whole Star Wars universe. I was disappointed that we wouldn't see more of the characters (although understood that going in).

 Great film of course its a movie made for fanatics. And since I'm one of those i can say that this film is the best one since Disney took over Star Wars. I love the way they end this film and how it goes directly on the action of A New Hope. Also loved the new planets especially Scarif. Vader was included as much as it was necessary no more no less. Loved the work of Michael Giacchino. Probably the biggest problem is the character of Grand Moff Tarkin i understand that they want to bring him here but since the actor is dead maybe it was enough to bring him in form of a hologram not a person who talks walks and such things. Overall i loved this film, 5.0,  tudor t, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976988610/, December 24 2017, N/A

 Rogue one is a stellar blend of mold breaking and meeting expectations for the Star Wars legacy. Re-entering the foray of the galactic civil war for the first time since Return of the Jedi Rogue One truly sets the bar high as to the versatility of the Star Wars universe.

 My favorite Star Wars next to ANH. The only flaws I see with it are how over-confident the studio was with Tarkin and that the squid thing was kinda dumb.

 The best film to come out of the Disney acquisition of the Star Wars franchise. Here we are given a plot that actually has weight and adds to the Star Wars mythos. It does a satisfying job bridging the gap between the prequels and the original film and for once allows a Star Wars story to be fun without getting bogged down by the murkiness of Lucas's made up jedi religion. Jyn is an improvement over The Force Awaken's Rey as a strong female lead in a Star Wars movie. She has weight and development where Rey has mystery and not much else. The supporting characters are relatively well-developed give how much of the screen time is shared with others. The CGI cameos apparently are jarring for some fans but I was astounded by seeing Peter Cushing up on the silver screen once again and the scenes with Darth Vader are tremendously rewarding. The action is top notch and exciting. It's just good old-fashioned Star Wars fun and though the ending may be sad it does not dampen the adventurous spirit of the film. I won't say its the best film since the original trilogy (I rather partial to the Revenge of the Sith) but I certainly understand if fans feel that way. A much welcome addition to the franchise., 4.5,  Matthew T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/795491523/, January 2 2018, N/A

 Great movie. Liked everything about it. So it is possible for a new Star Wars movie to be good. How did the Last Jedi happen? That is the greatest mystery of all. Especially when seeing that a new Star Wars movie like Rogue One can have a great story rich character development and amazing visuals. My only small complaint about this movie is why did Darth Vader look so different in this movie when it backs right up to A New Hope. Go rewatch them side by side. I noticed it when I first watched Rogue One in the theatre and then looked side-by-side and couldn't believe the difference. Someone dropped the ball there but this complaint is such a small detail that it is hardly worth a mention., 4.5,  Two Z, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976957393/, December 22 2017, N/A

 Superb Star Wars spin off movie. Unlike the complete mess that is The Last Jedi Rogue One is a tightly directed masterclass on how to make a thrilling science fantasy movie. Star Wars fans have to realise that this is really a war story /thriller set in the Star Wars universe and so light sabres and the force don't really feature much. The English director and set design team use real sets (just like the original) wherever possible instead of blue screen and CGI. As a result the film looks amazing and much more like the original Star Wars than the dreadful Prequels. The editing is brilliant being slow when necessary and fast during action scenes. Cinematography is beautiful. Characters are strong and the story is simple and consistent. Strong performances from a great cast.

 It's kinda sad when a bunch of unknown people had to die had to sacrifice themselves in this way so Leia and the Rebellion could have eventually destroyed the Death Star in 1977 "Star Wars" a bunch of little yet important characters (even not everyone being well built) that weren't remembered by anyone in the following years of the struggle against the Empire. But anyway "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" is a good movie and a good starter of the anthology/origins Star Wars "film series"., 3.5,  Francisco Q, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976126568/, December 21 2017, N/A

 This film enhances every bit of the original films while giving us a new view of the Star Wars universe. <br><br>Every choice and life in this movie matters- rather than ending life on an epic scale or raising the stakes by making bigger weapons The stakes are raised by making us care about people who choose to fight despite insurmountable odds.

 I absolutely loved this movie from beginning to end. <br>I consider myself to be a Star Wars fanatic and thought this movie had all the draw excitement and feel of the original trilogy. Whilst presenting an original and captivating story that fitted perfectly to the beginning of 'A New Hope'<br>The characters are engaging and entertaining and you are really left rooting for them and for the true fans its great to see the origins of "Rogue" Squadron. <br><br>There are tons of easter eggs for the die hard fans but equally the movie is entertaining for a first timer. I lost count of the number of times that I exclaimed with excitement. Although darker than most of the rest of the Star Wars movies with a distinctly "Empire" feel I thought this perfectly suited the story and I really loved the ending which I found really moving. Seeing Vader at the height of the dark side was absolutely priceless and the lead female Heroine was an awesome powerful character reminiscent of young Leia which just goes to prove that women are truly equal in the Star Wars universe.

 The first half is underwhelming to say the least. The characters are superficial and the dialogues stilted the script does a fairly bad job at establishing anything and emerges as confusing and unengaging while the scarce action is weak and devoid of thrills.

 I had skipped this addition to the star wars saga but after watching episode 8 I figured to give it a shot. Honestly this movie puts the "war" in star wars. Finally they show the true reality of what war is actually like put into a star wars setting. It shows the sacrifice that is necessary at times and also the brutality. It also sheds light on morality of those at war the conflict of following orders even though they may be flawed. One of my favorite star wars and sure as hell is better than both of the newer installments to the main story. And at least it has a solid plot line to follow unlike last jedi.

Unless she was comanding the attack but in the movie wasn't the case so why ruin all the time line history with a hair taked scene??? alll an excellent movie ruined by their last 2 minutes..., 3.0,  Roberto P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/911727514/, December 10 2017, N/A
 Successes: First and foremost the film gets commended for taking a story we originally took for granted and finding a way to make it enthralling. Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) is a tremendous character one who is in competition for strongest female in the franchise. I say that and understand how well Princess Leia and Rey are received. She's great and Jones was fantastic in the role. The entire group of rebels is a diverse bunch that are all likable in their own ways. Chirrut Inwe (Donnie Yen) as a blind badass was one of the cooler characters and I enjoyed his back and forth with his buddy Baze Malbus (Jiang Wan). K2SO (voiced by Alan Tudyk) proved to be one of the better droid characters. He added a comic element to several scenes while also getting one of the best moments in the climactic battle. Speaking of the big action scene in the end it's a definite highlight. The scale is massive and the tension built throughout is excellent. You care about each group going through these battles. Honestly all big action scenes deliver in spades from the escape on Jedha City to the rain soaked battle on Eadu. Of course everything is visually stunning. The last thing I wanted to touch on was Darth Vader. I know some were weary of his addition but ever since the final moments of Revenge of the Sith I badly wanted to see Darth in action again. We got that here and the scene where he destroys a bunch of guys brought out the excited kid in me.<br><br>Failures: Most of the casting in this is spot on but I just couldn't get past Forrest Whitaker as Saw Gerrara. The idea to put a distinguished veteran actor in the role was the right way to go. However Whitaker is one of those guys who kind of sticks out. When I watched it I saw Whitaker and not Saw. That was a major issue (among others) when I saw Will Smith in Suicide Squad. The CGI work on Princess Leia and Grand Moff Tarkin was also a bit distracting. The first act is also a bit too slow at points with things only really getting going once they reach Jedha City.<br><br>Overall: Though it's not part of the official Star Wars episodes this film is pivotal to the overall story. I know a lot of people accepted the Death Star plot hole so this wasn't a needed story but if you can put out a great movie I say you go ahead and do it. It's a great story with tons of action and mostly original characters with the right dash of nostalgia., 4.5,  Kevin P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976511688/, December 10 2017, N/A
 On a whole I thought it was boring and turnt it off on a rewatch. Same old thing from Star Wars it's all about destroying a Death Star. On its own it's a decent movie with plenty of action. But as usual with Star Wars it's very overrated. Casting was good and has a superb scene with Darth Vader. Overall it's worth a watch but not a patch on Force Awakens., 2.5,  Aaron M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/858556936/, December 10 2017, N/A

 I think this movie made a whole new dimension available to Star Wars. The rebels were always just this 2D group of guys who yelled "Yah!" and then got killed or celebrated. The levels of grey that this movie availed made sense for characters that weren't main heroes ie. just humans. Gives Star Wars a chance to demonstrate real sacrifice and more human pains. Not to mention Donnie Yen is my favorite martial artist and kicks all kind of ass in this movie. K is super-funny and hands down best Vader saber scene ever!, 5.0,  Joey H, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976907070/, December 2 2017, N/A
 This is the STAR WARS film you're looking for. It is a unique star wars experience that gives you the original trilogy feeling. The cast was perfect in all aspects and couldn't play it out any better. The action and conflict build up extraordinarily and set up 'A New Hope' perfectly while also attaching all loose strings together. The movie also shows the most emotion out of all Star Wars movies in which it left a strong emotional impact on me. The best thing is that the movie shows the dark side of both sides of the war by telling us that even the Rebels have made murderous mistakes throughout their lives. Unfortunately the film rushes to some spots quickly and doesn't spend the needed time during certain scenes. The characters sometimes also felt rushed and didn't develop correctly to become the 'team' we see during the final act. In short the movie is a gritty war movie that also maintained its 'Star Wars' feeling.

 The plot and story were fantastic. Most of the characters were relateable though some needed some work. I'm only giving four stars because as much as I love super long nerd movies I want all of that time to be filled with development or excitement. There were a few spots in this movie that I found to be boring and unnecessary. I could have slept through them and never known I missed them. Other than that it was great., 4.0,  Katie B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/974020880/, November 29 2017, N/A

 A technically impressive film that is the same formula again this film adds nothing new to the franchise and does very little to establish the new characters and relies too much on nostalgia, 2.0,  Brian D, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976424053/, December 17 2017, N/A
 I was admittedly apprehensive when Lucasfilm/Disney announced that they would be producing anthology Star Wars stories outside of continuing the main episodic saga. Though it is just their first such effort seeing Rogue One gave me confidence that these movies can work. Though this takes place in familiar territory (right before A New Hope) it expands and deepens the already-existing mythology without feeling like a retread. You know how the story will end but you are still entranced by the journey to get to that end result. It's hard not to watch the original film now without thinking of this one and that's good in this case. Technically the movie is visually stunning perhaps even more so than the previous year's The Force Awakens. As for the instances where the filmmakers tread the uncanny valley with two characters from the original movie I think they did an adequate job. The CGI there wasn't perfect but I've gotten used to this on subsequent viewings and doesn't take any enjoyment of the film away for me. The cast here is also pretty good. While this may not have the best performances of the actors' careers they serve the story well. Speaking of the story I found it particularly bold [SPOILERS] for the main characters to be killed off. Granted the original film essentially called for this as they do not appear or are explicitly mentioned in Episode IV. However I would not have been surprised if a few had been allowed to survive and were just shipped off to the other end of the galaxy to explain their absence. Thankfully that was not the way the creators went so kudos to them. Now this isn't a perfect film. I wish a little more time could've been spent delving into the characters' backgrounds and motivations. Also the Bor Gullet scene was pretty unnecessary in the same vein the rathtars were in Episode VII. I think these are pretty easy to overlook though and shouldn't impede one's enjoyment of Rogue One., 4.0,  Griff C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976670260/, December 17 2017, N/A

 Está bastante interesante y entretenida aporta información sobre lo que pasa entre el episodio III y el IV cómo obtiene Leia los planos de la Estrella de la Muerte que después oculta en R2-D2 y después desencadena toda la caída del Imperio en los siguientes episodios. La verdad que aunque los personajes son un poco planos la peli te mantiene enganchada durante toda su duración y el final es emotivo. Hay muchos guiños a las películas originales y tambiés eso es un plus. A los fans de Star Wars les gustará.

 There's this epic feeling watching the original Star Wars trilogy that honestly I didn't get with any other film in the franchise. The Force Awakens didn't The Revenge of the Sith didn't The Phantom Menace certainly didn't. But.... Rogue One has changed that. I finished this movie with an energy running through me.

 I might be one of few people to like this one as much as I did but if this movie is any indication of the rest of the Star Wars anthology films they might actually contend with the new trilogy in terms of quality and storytelling.

 Of the Star Wars movies released since Disney had taken over this is by far the best. Following resistance fighters against the Empire that steal the Death Star plans in the famous "victory" mentioned in the opening crawl of A New Hope this story combines action darkness and nostalgia to create an appealing film. There are some cheesy scenes such as the blind man shooting down a Tie Fighter and fighting a group of Stormtroopers with nothing but a stick but overall the film is fair and realistic. The last 3 minutes of the film with Darth Vader adds a whole star in and of itself onto my rating. The film also explores (although it was forced to be toned down by Disney) a dark side of Star Wars an almost adult Star Wars. There is no happy ending there is evil and horror. It gives me hope that Disney may create a rated R Star Wars paramilitary film but toys don't sell to adults. Still a great film worth seeing and hears to hoping Disney continues with individual stories within the Empire time period., 5.0,  Colin F, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976925685/, December 15 2017, N/A

 A pointless film with Star Wars bits in it. The film was a self-indulgent featurette of Star Wars type things for Star Wars fanatics with an incredibly shallow and dull plotline. <br><br>It's first shortfall are the characters. Jynn Erso is frigid and uninteresting in how she delivers her lines. It was like having Jane Eyre in Star Wars. Next this Not-Jedi chappy. What was the point? Why not have an actual Jedi? This is actually a good metaphor for the movie. Trying to be different and in its own vein with cosmetic changes which just make it seem silly. There's the loveable robot. The man with the big gun. And a host of other characters which are purely forgettable and designed purely to amuse an easy to please audience. <br><br>The sheer populism of the film was chokingly obvious. Our comedy heros the Stormtroopers are back and they have never been able to shoot less straight. The infinite onscreen deaths of Stormtroopers their inability to shoot straight and just the sheer ease at which the good guys achieve success makes the film unrewarding and cheap. Star Wars can do so much better the First Order Stormtroopers were menacing and scary great bad guys. <br><br>The plot - well there wasn't much of a plot. We all knew where it was going. The first part of the film just attempted to show how the team gets together introducing characters because we need characters without adding anything to the plot. Then the second half was the inevitable showdown on whichever planet or moon they had chosen. In all fairness the new tropical biosphere they chose to stage part two in was interesting. Star Wars in the Bahamas almost. So the film did manage to come up with something new. But on the whole the plot was unsurprising and lacking in innovation. <br><br>So why does it get one star? Simple. Grand Moff Tarkin and Darth Vader. If I had my way I'd have had it all about these guys. The reanimation of Peter Cushing (not Peter Sellers as a friend of mine said. Governor Clusoe captain of the Death Star anyone?) as Tarkin was amazing. Hand on heart I couldn't tell he was animated. They couldn't do the same for Princess Leia though who looks like a china doll. But that's by the by. Tarkin was menacing and evil. And you even got to see him in boots a treat given how Cushing refused to wear anything more than carpet slippers for the original. <br>And the best bit was Vader. We had the geriatric 1970s robot Vader in the original films with his main powers seeming to be moving very slowly and choking people through TVs. Now he's back and better than ever. The 35 seconds worth of his storming down a hallway slaughtering a squad of horribly outclassed rebel soldiers with lightsaber slicing through the air faster than we've ever seen is the best bit of the entire film. I loved this bit. And it might honestly be the most exciting Star Wars scene I've put my eyes on. <br><br>But on the whole the film was a load of populist tripe. "What will the audience like? Okay we'll put that in." The film had no subtlety. It tried to be different for the sake of attempting to be quirky while coming off as boring. "Rogue One we salute you." Am I supposed to feel sad here? My only emotion was "Thank GOD it's almost over.", 0.5,  Alex M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976921111/, December 13 2017, N/A

 Hated everything about this except for Alan Tudyk's performance. Had no connection with the characters so didn't care that they died. The music gave me zero emotional "feels".

The fan Easter eggs where like a dad joke where the dad feels the need to keep explaining it because he thinks you didn't get it but you really you got it the first time and it was OK but now you're over it.

 A grittier darker more adult treatment of Star Wars. For once a Star Wars prequel takes full advantage of its chronology and the lore of the series by fully taking advantage of the many opportunities to connect and tie itself into that herritage. The ending alone warrants high praise. The action is also much more intense and mature. The feel is closer to a war movie (which the story really demands) as opposed to mere action-adventure. The tragic sacrifice of the plot marks the series finally taking full ownership and responsibility for the full scope and consequences of the subject matter used to form this now-classic story.

 The first Star Wars spin off succeeds at being a fantastic amount of fun whilst also being a great gift to Star Wars fans. While the tone is not quite the dark serious one promised the film achieves a great mix of adventure and light heartiness something the Force Awakens did not strike quite as well but will leave some fans feeling indifferent. However where this movie does falter is the lack of character and development with the changing locations and drawn out story moments taking away from great characters and performances with the film's lead Felicity Jones probably struggling the most. This being said the movie is a true marvel for it's amazing visuals and production work with amazing cinematography costumes locations and best of all ground breaking character animation. The nostalgia here is truley something special and captivating that will get to the heart of any true Star Wars fan as we see moments and characters literally lifted from the frame in an entirely new and exciting way.

 Superb entry in the Star Wars franchise mainly due to the fact the filmmakers have shown a willingness to take the story in more serious &amp darker directions. The cast is excellent across the board with Felicity Jones making another excellent Star Wars heroine while Ben Mendelson is solid as the villainous Director Krennic. The scene-stealer though as Alan Tudyk as the droid K-2SO whose dry wit &amp matter of fact way of speaking delivers most of the films best lines. Combined with some outstanding performance capture work you forget he's a CGI creation. Behind the camera Gareth Edwards delivers on his original intention of making a gritty war film in the Star Wars universe with our heroes making some difficult choices while many don't make it out. Granted since Disney wants to keep this franchise PG-13 at best it not as dark as most but for Star Wars it's the grittiest the franchise has seen and impressive in the consequences our heroes face. It even fixes some plot-holes from "New Hope" particularly one about the Death Star that has plagued fans for decades. It does go overboard with the cameos as some are distracting though others work perfectly (Darth Vader's appearance is brief but epic only adding to the legend of his character). Overall another great Star Wars film from Disney that dare I say it is better than "Force Awakens"., 4.5,  Johnathon W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/857932456/, November 19 2017, N/A

 Rogue One accomplishes what no other Star Wars film has achieved: it brings forth a strong female lead with a sympathetic past who has a complete character arc that is fully realized within a single movie. Jynn Erso has been a victim of circumstances. Abandoned by everyone she loved she has now turned to a life of petty crime but when evidence of her family's love and sacrifice for her she takes up arms in their memory. Rogue One isn't about the theft of the Death Star Plans it's about the love between a father and a daughter. Along the way Star Wars fans happen to be treated to one of the best war sequences of space and ground combat ever shown on the silver screen. The space combat rivals Return of the Jedi's fight above Endor and the ground battle blows Hoth away. Rogue one shows the darkness of war builds on the mythology of the universe provides memorable and endearing characters and pairs well with the ongoing Star Wars: Rebels cartoon series as a live action bridge to A New Hope.

 the story is about how the rebels got the death star plans so already know that the rebels will get the plans so to make it work the movie had to tell an emotional story which for the most part it does.<br><br>the characters I enjoyed them all but I liked jyn the most because she got the most development i felt the most for her one the problem with the movie is the other characters get very little to zero character development when the deaths happened I felt the emotion of the deaths and how the war affected them but I would have felt more and probably cried if they got more development and Darth Vader is really cool and badass to watch but he is not in the movie much has three scenes and one character is bald in the first scene he was in but had hair in all the other scenes that really noticeable.<br><br>the actions is very good it's fun looks great the hole movie looks great the action really gets to the feels of how crazy and emotional war is., 4.0,  Ronnie N, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/975985648/, November 11 2017, N/A

 Rogue One attempts to justify the fact that Disney is milking this iconic franchise however it falls flat on it's face. Competently made but not much else. The characters are flat action is grounded and strips all the fun out of Star Wars (and ironically highlights how goofy it actually looks) and film moves at a slog's pace. The more I think about this movie the more I dislike the reasoning for why it was made.

 Confusing. I spent the whole movie trying to figure out the point of this movie. It turns out this is chronologically Episode 3 1/2 and has nothing to do with the movie released a couple of years ago. It also has little to to with the Star Wars movies in that their is little use of the Force and no light sabers (except briefly by Darth Vader). The CGI is impressive (or nauseating) as they reanimate figures who are dead in real life (Governor Tarkin Princess Leia the leader of the rebels and I don't know who else). Disney is obviously worried about getting their billion dollar investment in Lucas Films back as quickly as possible.

 Rogue One directed by Gareth Edwards is the first standalone film in the Star Wars saga and by far the most intriguing in the franchise. Set as a prequel to Episode 4: A New Hope Rogue One brings in a group of unknown rebels led by Jyn Erso (played by Felicity Jones) as they travel to new worlds to find the plans to the Death Star devised by her father Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelson). Gareth Edwards who's other major films include 'Godzilla' and 'Monsters' brings in a new perspective into the Star Wars universe combining characters and action so well you'll leave the theater buzzing for more (even when you realize that it leaves you right off a New Hope).<br><br>The plot to Rogue One is very simple but it's the characters that really take this movie to new heights. The likes of Jyn Captain Andor (Diego Luna) K-2S0 (Alan Tudyk) Chirrut Imwe (Donnie Yen) and Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) make this movie worth watching (other than it being a Star Wars film). The droid K-2S0 was the stand-out secondary character able to bring great sources of humour while still being of use. But the real star of the show was Jyn Erso with Felicity Jones doing a great job as the female lead. She is tough rebellious and reckless making her a well-crafted character that has a great backstory.<br><br>Though Star Wars creates great protagonists Rogue One's main antagonist Orson Krennic is definitely up there with the best. Ben Mendelsohn is powerful able to give you a villain that any Star Wars fan would want.<br><br>The action was also spectacular with the final climatic fight one of the best in the franchises history which is definitely saying something. Full of wonder and delight you never drift your eyes away from the screen with the special effects staff deserving full recognition as they recreate some of the characters of the originals.<br><br>It seems hard to not mention Darth Vader so I will. He has little screen-time but for every second he is in he steals the show. One scene in particular was very special as we see him in action for the first time in years.<br><br>Overall Rogue One is a Star Wars movie that really takes you on a different journey from what you would be used to. It connects itself so well to the beginning of A New Hope you could combine both movies with no problem. The cast and crew deserve the credit for the effort they made in creating a standalone film in the biggest franchise in movie history. Though the most 'war-like' of the 8 films it still has moments of levity spread throughout which reminds you of the original Star Wars spirit. It stands alone in the saga and I believe it stands as one of the best., 4.0,  Byron A, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976538509/, November 5 2017, N/A

 The episode III 1/2.<br><br>So this is like a bridge between the original trilogy and the next three prequels. A story where the main characters from the original tale are not involved. Being a big fan of this franchise I loved it. I did not expect big so got entertained well. But pity that this wonderful characters are not going to return. This is just a one-off film. For seeing its overwhelming success there could be a prequel which has a very very slim chance.<br><br>The story was like that had started in a half way. That's why I wanted a prequel to tell us the Galen Erso's point of view story. When he has been taken back to the base to work for the Empire his daughter is the only one who escapes from there. After a few years later the grown- up daughter Jyn end up on the rebel's side. When she hints a plan for them to strike the Empire nobody considers it. But a rogue gang forms where they all does according to her saying. That's the story and how it all ends are the rest.<br><br>The story was simple but the action-adventures were good. Like what a 'Star Wars' fans want to see. The main drawback was there's no familiar faces around. Even the original franchise style of title and credit presentation was off the beat. Though there were cameos. Darth Vade Princess Leia R2D2 and 3PO including a small lightsabre fight at the end just to satisfy the fanboys. Overall a worthy film otherwise it would have not earned one billion at the box office making one of the top 10 of all time.<br><br>8/10, 4.0,  Rangan R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/905667511/, November 4 2017, N/A

 Unlike The Force Awakens which somehow managed to make an epic story feel incredibly small Rogue One does the opposite: the stakes may be more abstract and personal but there's a tangibility here that renders it far more involving than its main-series cousin. Rogue One carries the nuance of Star Wars' Extended Universe to the big screen and becomes its very own thing in the process. A great sci-fantasy grand adventure. Also it gets bonus points for a great soundtrack that even quotes the N64 game "Rogue Squadron" musically., 5.0,  Fabian S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/911514055/, October 29 2017, N/A

 Unprecedented levels of fan service. Cameos that go nowhere and serve nothing narratively. A cast of uninspired poorly developed characters (perhaps partially due to the time eaten by needless cameos).<br><br>The major positives that I will give the film are the I felt seamless visual effects and the way in which Gareth Edwards communicates the size and scale of objects. Beyond that I haven't much to say.<br><br>As a die hard fan of the Star Wars franchise it was neat being served but as a filmmaker and as a fan of original stories there was a lot left to be desired.<br><br>I just can't for the life of me discern why this story had to be told in the grand scheme of things? It offers nothing. Fans accepted the Death Star plot hole (pun intended) and none of these characters carry over into subsequent films. So why tell the story?<br><br>Also the film is wildly over-edited.

 So this past Saturday which vege out with Netflix day I finally broke down and watched Rogue One. It's a bit of a watchable movie although not terribly exciting. I just wonder how they were able to CGI Peter Cushing in the movie since he died decades ago. I'm giving it a 7 out of 10 because it still doesn't hold a candle to "A New Hope" or <br>"The Empire Strikes Back". It's just part of Disney's money-making machine and the StarWars fanboys who weren't born when the original trilogy came out., 3.5,  darth v, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/894063615/, October 23 2017, N/A

 My Review: 7/10<br>Date: 10/20/17<br>Rogue One was a good dark gritty guerrilla war action film. It was quite a bit darker than other Star Wars films but it did have the sarcastic K2 droid for some humor which was well done. I thought the characters and action were well done. The plotting and science behind it left a lot to be desired with some kind of silly plots about data transfers and shields (and it being very important to communicate to bring down the shields even though they were already doing that and how do communications get through the shield but not data?). Vader seemed a bit off and I thought the CGI characters were a bit distracting., 3.5,  Brian K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/915025216/, October 21 2017, N/A
 A film that makes the plot of the original Star Wars movie much more interesting but lacks energy and personality.

 Really really disappointing.

 My biggest issue with Rogue One is at the end of the day its a filler movie you can completely skip over it and not miss anything of grave importance to the story. For being a prequel that takes place moments before Episode 4 it doesn't do a great job lining up those events purposely screwing around with whats established in the next film just for the sake of fan service. The characters are also flat and uninteresting so you don't care what happens to them in the end. And what was up with that CGI Tarkin?

 Set immediately before Episode 4 Jyn Erso is the daughter of Galen Erso a senior scientist for The Empire. They have not seen each other in 15 years. Due to her father's position Jyn is liberated from Empire imprisonment by the Rebel Alliance. Word has come to them that he is helping build a weapon that tilt the balance of power firmly in favour of The Empire - the Death Star. Reluctantly Jyn is drawn into the struggle.<br><br>Pretty formulaic but reasonably interesting. Set up is pretty basic and plot feels implausible and contrived at times plus the characters are not that engaging. <br><br>Character depth engagement and soundness of plot are not what this movie is about. Action scenes adventure and CGI are and here it does pretty well. Quite exciting with a momentum that keeps you watching. Does degenerate into fairly predictable fight scenes and plot development towards the end though.<br><br>Overall: okay and on par with Episodes 4-6.

 "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" was pretty much what everyone thought it was going to be not really much more but definitely not anything less. Rogue One follows Felicity Jones (Jyn Erso) as she tries to help the rebels stop the imperials from completing and using the famous death star giving you another angle on the Star Wars universe. I myself am a pretty big Star Wars fan and I have to say that Rogue One wasn't the worst Star Wars made for sure but I wouldn't say it was one of the best. It does have some interesting moments in it and scenes that definitely gave the movie the feel of the Star Wars universe much unlike the dreaded prequels. Felicity Jones does a very good job as does pretty much everyone in this movie it's good enough to give you the vibe that this is an actual Star Wars movie. However there wasn't a whole lot that really happened in the movie as the entire movie was based off of a side-plot in "Star Wars: A New Hope". There are some cool cameos and references here and there that tie in to A New Hope which I really liked but this movie didn't really present to much to me as its own movie. The plot needed to have just a little bit more to it as it mainly relied on battle scenes (most of which didn't even have lightsabers or jedi or the force just the crappy laser guns that the random Star Wars characters use) to make the movie exciting. Generally though this movie wasn't terrible and there definitely is an audience that will really love "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story". However I was neither amazed nor dissapointed and I will say that "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" is only worth watching if you're bored., 3.0,  Movie M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/974855426/, September 19 2017, N/A
 A story outside the main saga Rogue One is still essential viewing for anyone with a fondness for the original Star Wars trilogy. Like The Force Awakens this is not a flawless film but it almost seems churlish to pick nits given the end result: finally we have a Star Wars prequel with all the tragedy pathos excitement and strangeness that we were expecting all those years ago seamlessly fitting into the universe we all know and love. The cast is excellent the story is superb and the effects are stunning. An amazing achievement., 4.5,  Dion D, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/789995880/, September 19 2017, N/A

 The best part was the sarcastic robot. They could have made a movie about that dude and I would have been fine with it. Gin was AWFUL arguably the worst part of the film. The actor sucked but it wasn't mainly her fault. She was INCREDIBLY poorly written. Her character changes on a whim every scene she has a different personality.<br><br> The ending wasn't super good either. I don't remember the rest of the characters because they are so one note and boring. There was an almost Jedi who knew the force and stuff I guess? But he never uses the force and he has a stick. His friend was a big dude with a big gun. Simple enough. <br><br>The pilot who had almost no introduction and died without me realizing it. The dude that seems like a peice of garbage is still a peice of garbage by the end. Gin (or Jin I really dont know and I don't care enough to find out) and him fall in love even though they spent all but 5 minutes together for whatever reason.<br><br> At the end everyone dies which is sad I guess. I liked the robot I wanted him to survive. Pretty much everyone dies in vain. Robot saves Jin Jin spends forever finding the plans Mr. Pilot guy called the other rebels I think. Almost Jedi walks into the middle of a feild and dies and then his buddy gets mad and then walks into a feild and dies as well. Garbage and Jin smooch as the planet explodes.<br><br>But then comes the coolest part of the movie and IMO they should have used stuff like this for the whole movie. Darth Vader busts in and kicks the crap out of everyone. Its awesome and the only memorable part. <br><br>Personally this movie is pretty bad. Its not memorable fun and it doesn't have good or interesting characters. Its a shame because it had potential. Maybe if they got rid of Jin and Garbage it could have been better. It wasn't even CLOSE to The Force Awakens which was a good time from start to finish. When you have a good movie you care less about the bad stuff. (I know FA wasn't perfect but I still had fun watching it) If you have a boring and non sensical movie the flaws come out and it becomes much worse. That is why I will perfer The Originals to the Prequels. I thought thats why everyone else did too? But I guess not according to this movie., 2.0,  Mark W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/974798306/, September 12 2017, N/A

 Rogue One: A Star Wars Masterpiece<br> Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is the latest installment in the ever-expanding Star Wars universe. Released in December of 2016 Rogue One follows the story of the daughter of an Imperial architect and her quest to help the Rebel Alliance retrieve the Death Star plans. The movie strays away from the original plot and storyline that we've seen time and time again from other Star Wars movies: the big disastrous thing floating in the sky and the rebel's quest to defeat it. But not this one. This is an all new adventure that takes us to different ends of the Star Wars galaxy.<br>The story begins on a desolate planet where we find Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) trying to avoid capture from the Imperial Director Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn). We are then reintroduced to her when she is rescued from an imperial prison by the rebels and brought to Yavin 4. There she meets Captain Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) and K-2SO voiced by Alan Tudyk. They travel to the holy city of Jedha the site of the original Jedi temple where they try to find a defected Imperial pilot Bodhi Rook (Riz Ahmed) who supposedly knows where Jyn's father is. Jyn is met by an old friend Saw Gerrera played by Forest Whitaker who shows her a hologram of her father. The hologram tells her how to exactly destroy the Death Star. The hologram is destroyed and the Rebels have only Jyn's word to believe. Jyn and her new-found friends hijack an Imperial cargo ship which is how the name "Rogue One" came to be. They dock at the Imperial base on Scarif the location of the plans. There we see a huge war scene between the Imperial and Rebel forces allowing Jyn and Cassian to retrieve the Death Star plans and transmit them to the Rebel forces above the planet. <br> Rogue One is an adventurous Star Wars film that stands alone all while still connecting back to the saga. It does a good job of tying in beloved characters of the past like Darth Vader Grand Moff Tarkin as played by the late Peter Cushing and a young Princess Leia while introducing a new cast of characters. Rogue One gives the audience an idea of what was going on between the 2005 film Revenge of the Sith and George Lucas' original 1977 film Star Wars later called Star Wars: A New Hope. Gareth Edwards the Director brings a unique spin to his version of the Star Wars universe. The stand-a-lone film does an effective job of bringing new elements to Star Wars while still answering questions from previous movies. Audiences can see how the rebels came to have the death stars plans as seen in the original movie. It also tells the story of the missing squadron in A New Hope. Luke Skywalker's squadron is called Roque 2 with no mention of a Rogue 1. With this movie we now know what happened to Rogue One.<br> My one complaint about the film is the lack of character development. I understand that you cannot have a 10-hour movie but I would have like to have seen some characters get more of a back story. For example Cassian explains to Jyn that "some people have been fighting this war longer than others" and that he's been fighting since he was young but I wonder why? What happened in his life that made him join the Rebel Alliance and how did K-2SO come into the hands of the rebels? These are questions that you might be able to find in the Star Wars legends or canon books but the average Star Wars fan might not want to search for these answers.<br> If Rogue One does one thing it brings back a nostalgia for Star Wars fans of every age. Disney's rebirth of the Star Wars franchise as seen through The Force Awakens and Rogue One has rekindled fan's love for the saga. With the future lineup of Star Wars films on the way there is no reason why anyone's love for Star Wars should come to an explosive end like Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan., 4.5,  Andrew S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976750002/, October 9 2017, N/A

 You don't have to be a Star Wars fan to enjoy Rogue One being a fan of good filmmaking will guarantee you a great time. This standalone feature captures the essence of the Star Wars universe with its stunning scenery and captivating fight scenes while narrating a new well-crafted and thoughtful story. The cast was the heart of the rebellion and their performances were genuinely amazing. My favorite part however as a movie lover was the movie's editing and visual effects. They were absolutely breathtaking especially when compared to Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy which suffered from too much color filters that it became devoid of realism unlike The Lord Of Rings. The ships flying in the skies the giant architecture in the mountains the sand it looked so incredibly credible. I believe there are many more movies to add to this legendary franchise and if the film's are going to be anything like Rogue One: A Star Wars Story then I will surely be excited to watch every one., 3.5,  Farah R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/916050255/, October 5 2017, N/A

 A few too many winks but a solid Star Wars film. The strong characters lead the film away from the light saber battles surprisingly well. I didn't need the dumb cgi Leia I knew it was the ship and just seeing it fly away was enough for me for the connection to the episodes. This film will pave the way for future Star Wars anthologies and hopefully one with Lord Vader that horrifying scene in the corridor got my nerd level to 100. The film worked much better when it was in the trenches and the tone was way too much in line with the core franchise. I want a different and unconventional tone that has the ability to drag the franchise into some different genres. This had a dirty dozen vibe that needed further depth this film could've been incredible but it is worth the time to watch. Great film for the xmas period and Star Wars will own the month yet again Avatar might change that when it finally slots the release date though. 15-12-2017.<br><br>I have just rewatched this film and adjusted the initial rating from four and a half to a four. The villain work is a little tacky and while the filmmakers attempt an epic scope it never hits the highs of A new hope or The empire strikes back. The film has heart and that is the key ingredient for any star wars film it is also a mile better in quality compared to the prequel trilogy and if they can replicate this style of filmmaking for the Han Solo and The last Jedi the franchise will be in a safe direction. The best part of the film is the supporting players and they fill the void when the story begins to fatigue from reshoots. The ending for the key players is very unemotional while the Vader scene still gives goosebumps. I still don't agree with Leia in the finale but it keeps the pace going for the setup to A new hope. The music score tries to be too epic all the time this film needed to be more of a dirty dozen war film the final battle scene is incredibly paced and filmed.19-06-2017., 4.0, , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/909990449/, October 2 2017, Super-reviewer
 Despite its cliches smatterings of deus ex machinas and the uncreative idea do make the whole basis of the story to fill a plot hole in A New Hope it was OK overall.

 Great acting a smart script and amazing action all come together to make an entertaining film that is fantastic in every sense of the word. Alan Tudyk steals the show as K-2SO but the entire cast is at the height of their powers so to speak. The CGI faces of Grand Moff Tarkin and Princess Leia are so realistic that I honestly thought they were real.

 DUDE. THAT's a Star Wars movie. Yes the first half is a little bit of a mess and the pacing is a little bit off at times (just like in The Force Awakens though less) but the characters and their development is much better in this one and oh boy did I love that second half that somewhat unconventional climax that ending. [SPOILERS]<br><br>It's a shame we probably won't be seeing these characters together again I loved the group and to be introduced to them to then have them all die is heartbreaking but worthwhile nonetheless.

 Worse than Attack of the Clones. I loved the Force Awakens. What the hell was this? It looked like a pack of middle eastern terrorists blowing stuff up! In the opening scene one such "hero" pushes his friend down a wall they are both climbing to his death so he can get away. That's one of our protagonists? I was rooting for the Empire to kill them all by the end. I mean I've watched the original three at least 100 times since I was a kid. I've seen Force Awakens 4-5 times since we bought it.

 There's a limited amount of suspense you can build when you already know the final outcome of a film. Some of the appeal of this film comes from nostalgia there are a lot of devoted fans of Star Wars and there are plenty of Easter eggs and references to the Star Wars saga to catch your interest. The most interesting characters in this film are definitely Alan Tudyk's K-2SO and Donnie Yen's Chirrut Imwe who provide all of the laughs and a lot of the most enjoyable moments in the film. Unfortunately the rest of the characters are fairly dull and forgettable Jyn Erso played by Felicity Jones is particularly bland and really doesn't do all that much in the film acting as more of a passive observer and not the hero the trailers led us to believe she would be. The digital version of Grand Moff Tarkin is also rather distracting and detracts from several scenes in this film understandably they had to use CGI as the original actor has passed away and it would be very difficult to tell the story without him but as soon as you see him on screen something doesn't look right and he falls somewhere in the uncanny valley. As far as prequels go this isn't a bad attempt but as a stand alone film it's nothing special., 2.5,  Patricia W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976642015/, September 11 2017, N/A
 This is NOT a Star Wars film. <br><br>This is fan service slop. It basically takes everything wonderful about the originals such as the iconic characters of Luke Leia Han Chewie and replaces it with a brain-dead cast of nobodies (and an autistic robot) that I can't even remember a single name of. I mean ffs I can remember General Ackbar (A Bloody fish character) from the originals but not the lead role of this film?! Wait hang on a minute! Who is the lead role?! <br>Anyone telling you this is a "War Documentary" needs to piss off thinking they can try and make it sound more interesting then what it is. Grayness. <br>The only redeeming factor I can give is that I can appreciate some of Gareth Edwards's directing in the battle sequences which yes are kinda fun seeing fan service AT AT explosions and shooting but there's no characters for me to care about and follow.<br>The ending was probably the best part. SPOILERS...<br>___________________________________________________________<br>The whole cast who I never gave a fuck about all died. YAY! But the best part was when Darth Vader turns up and beats the shit out of rebel scum which as much as I know is fan service actually seeing Darth Vader for the first time in a film actually not killing but absolutely MURDERING rebel scum in whats actually a really terrifying and darkly tonal scene (especially for a Star Wars film) and seeing his lightsaber light up in the dark as the rebels scream and run away was superb directing from Gareth. Disney almost was about to edit it out but Gareth Edwards wanted to keep it and I respect him for doing something DIFFERENT in a Star Wars but actually making it WORK. Seeing Darth Vader's character like that was actually fun and exciting and that's exactly what he was in that scene. CHARACTER! It's just a shame the rest of the film had the life sucked out of it and more than anything I blame disney and not Gareth for making this an 1000 timed edited mess of glum dullness. <br><br>Different is good but ONLY when it's done right!, 1.0,  Stephen B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976677498/, September 11 2017, N/A

 Lets imagine we all like burgers. Do you want your burger half cooked with a soggy bun  or a well done burger with all the trimmings you like? Then why are star wars fans accepting disneys weak and pathetic attempts to sell to our nostalgia? On a technical level the only thing right is the cgi and oh wow what a feat that is nowadays. The main female character (whatever her name is) has acheived quite the accomplishment to be worse than kristen(?) stewart. Almost every character fails to not look and act like a robot trying to replicate human emotion except ironically the robot provided for a very weak and nonsensical comedic relief attempt by disney. Couldnt disney have at least tried to hire on capable actors? That would have made up for the laughable attempt at making a script. Your selling point for a movie you hacks at disney should not be at playing at peoples nostalgia and making a quick buck but making a movie that has quality and uniqueness to it that will keep it alive through the ages. Something for people to look up to especially in a volatile political climate we see now. Star wars was made famous because people at that time needed to believe good could conquer evil along with the fact that it had unique special effects and great directing (for its time)., 2.0,  James B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976660441/, September 1 2017, N/A

 I lobed this movie. It tells the story of what happened right before the 4th episode (a new hope) in which the 4th movie just mentions that the death star plans were stolen... this movie is that story. It's similar to how the Animatrix movie filled in gaps and story lines to the matrix trilogy. I don't understand why anyone wouldn't like this movie. The special effects alone are worth seeing this movie lol. Donnie Yen is on point the droid is hilarious great action sequences... and did I mention the special effects are so bad ass!? lol.

 After the first time watching it in theaters I originally felt like I had just wasted $12. But after watching it after buying it for my sister who loves it I still feel the same way. I've watched it a total of 5 times now and the more I watch the more I forget about the characters. The only ones I remember is the blind guy who should've been a jedi the droid (who stole the movie) and of course Darth Vader who in the 2 scenes he was in made a more lasting impact then the ones who where in almost every other scene. The best thing other than the Vader scenes were the fighting scenes. They were amazing but it doesn't help when the story is put in second place to the action.

Decision that the characters make are putting it simple stupid and somewhat out of character at times. They really didn't know what they wanted to make with this.

 Once again the world goes ballistic for the new "Star Wars" film and again people are saying its the best in the franchise but in all honesty its one of the lesser films. It by no means is a bad film but its flawed. Lacking the classic title crawl and iconic music is a downer and the characters are all basically disposable since many of us know they won't be in the sequel (Episode IV - A New Hope). It leaves very little mystery to the story. They also jump to too many planets in the first 30 minutes its pretty annoying.

 Rogue One is a good film and fits in well with the Stars Wars universe. It has some great action and visuals and it even includes some great character introduced in many of the earlier films. One of the problems I do have is that the franchise lore has become so extensive it's not easy to keep track of all the characters both new and old and it seems that we have to just except them. If I was forced to rank them it's not as good as last year's The Force Awakens (#7?) nor does it rank ahead of Stars Wars # 3 &amp 4 but it's definitely better than # 12 and 6.

 The latest in the Star Wars lore "Rogue One" provides an unconventionally stylistic approach when benefitting as a follow up to "The Force Awakens" from the previous year that refreshed the excitement for the franchise. It's the first of the anthology series that are set to go deeper into the mythology between the films as an effective depth behind the basis storytelling of the Original Trilogy into the Sequel Trilogy after the Prequel Trilogy. Speaking of which the setting of "Rogue One" is the fifth prequel (including "The Clone Wars" as the fourth prequel) of the film series with an improved direction out of the other prequels due to the overall refresh.<br><br>A long time ago in the galaxy far far away...<br><br>As it was mentioned in the opening crawl that opened "A New Hope" in 1977 "Rogue One" follows a group of rebellious unlikely heroes during the time of conflicts to band together and steal the plans to the Death Star the Empire's ultimate weapon of destruction. The team grows as they go further into the mission to find how they were already connected as they're just ordinary people choosing to do extraordinary things becoming a part of something greater than themselves. It's a war to achieve hope for the Rebel Alliance.<br><br>"The Force Awakens" actually awaken renewed energy with fresh blood that not only the converted could enjoy with delight but also a welcoming invitation for newer converts to experience the excitement that took place for the Original Trilogy. "Rogue One" continues that energy in a form of a prequel for new stories to tell on new unexplored grounds that the big screen could only handle. That said energy went further when the film went for an unconventional direction under the auteurship of Gareth Edwards ("Monsters" "Godzilla") in the well-known aspects of the films: the narrative cinematography and characterization.<br><br>The film opens up omitting an opening crawl as well the iconic Star Wars theme music by John Williams that only appeared around the very end that leads into "A New Hope". It instead started expressing the effective depth by showing it than just saying it especially when it comes to recognition of the few pivotal characters for the arc of the film's main heroine Jyn. Also during that scene the aforementioned stylistic approach differs from how the other films were shot with exhilaration while it was more ominous this time by presence and width. The first impression upon the opening scene offers us a glimpse of what the film is going to be like and it gets capped off with another of composer Michael Giacchino's masterfully closely-related score to get the Force going.<br><br>From there the first element that underwent unconventionality is the narrative differing from the franchise's standards including as a surprising twist at the turned of events in the climax franchises' installments in general. The suitable structure with three divided settings that the characters goes through towards the final setting in the climax is probably a familiarity to how the other films' were structured still. But the main point of the narrative is the different route that the production changed direction a couple months before the release and it resulted to be different than how the other films ended. The ending note adds strength as the effective depth towards the importance of the events following it up chronologically.<br><br>The cinematography by Greig Fraser in a way to simply put without much to say since it's just a general description of what's been seen and how it formed the film into differentiation labeled the film to be a semi-grounded war film. Most of the action sequences in the films were more soaring while "Rogue One" took a slightly different approach in style of filmmaking by being less soaring. The camera was stuck to the ground more mimicking the war genre's cinematographic style within an epic space opera heightening the normal scale. The cinematography style isn't only an element to the unconventionality but also a factor for the refreshed energy for the franchise.<br><br>The third and final element to note from the film has a rather mixed effect into the entertainment value. In contrast to the other films the characterization has only a couple of known characters with little screen time to guide us through the strong Force of this one. The main spotlight that ran was on the newly introduced characters. Besides the divertive merit it felt almost bland due to unfamiliarity - or feeling alienated within a familiar setting - while maintaining a 4-star rating until the Force gotten stronger as the film progresses. The characterization particularly the titular team is still likable thanks to the acting from the divertive casting that built and fulfilled the characters to the very end. Then in an additional note the film impressively features a return to few characters from "A New Hope" with Darth Vader in his former glory as James Earl Jones returned to voice along with a few others being CGI to match the earlier age complexion nicely. <br><br>Overall "Rogue One" offers a different cinematic experience for the Star Wars fandom and those who are opened up to try it. It's one of the best of the films while right behind "The Force Awakens" even though it only created its own scale for the upcoming stories in the Anthology Series as a standalone with a very effective narrative. The first impression of what's an installment within the anthology is going to be like is impressive and entertaining to easily say it along with some excitement towards it and expected art to look forward to.

 I am a huge Star Wars fan just like a lot of people. However I didn't get crazy excited for this film like I did with The Force Awakens. I'm happy that I didn't as my lower expectations really helped me get into Rogue One. The story was a familiar one to me a bunch of misfit troublemakers for the establishment group together to reach a common goal: get the plans for the infamous Death Star. So the fact that it was Guardians of the Galaxy but Star Wars made it easy to like despite its flaws. For example the characters barely get enough time to establish themselves as... characters. I mean they're all likable in their own unique ways and folks like Jyn Erso (Felicity Day) and Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) are interesting but they aren't explored much at all. They kinda just say who they are and what they do and that's pretty much it. So big shock they're not that memorable. The film also has a choppy opening drags in the middle and some of the CGI is right in the Uncanny Valley. But for all these faults (probably me just nitpicking) I had a blast of a time once again being in the Star Wars universe. The cinematography and soundtrack were good and the 3rd Act (especially the last 10 minutes) were fantastic. One of the few times they are able to use Darth Vader in a Star Wars film nowadays and they don't waste him in the slightest. Rogue One also displays an interesting view of the time in the universe it's a war film. Some parts are brutal to watch and shows the relentlessness of both the Empire and the Rebels to win the war. As you maybe can see through my swollen piece on it I care about this franchise so I'm probably just over-criticising something I expect to laud over. Overall Rogue One is a really good extremely fun movie and I am looking forward to the next film in the franchise., 3.5,  Ross B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976577763/, July 28 2017, N/A

 GREG: (Greg Smith Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond VA) Scott it looks like the Star Wars franchise has returned to its roots.<br><br>SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison Professor of Psychology University of Richmond) Rogue won my heart Greg. Let s recap.<br><br>GREG: We re introduced to young Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones). Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) is her father and the lead designer of the Empire s new weapon - the Death Star. She was separated from her father at youth and raised by elite rebel Saw Gerrara (Forest Whitaker). The Rebellion needs Jyn now 28 to find Saw and determine what he knows about a message her father sent about the new weapon. She meets him at Jedha only to find that the Empire is there and is about to destroy the city - and Gerrar with it.<br><br>SCOTT: Jyn learns that Galen has sabotaged the design of the Death Star so that it can be destroyed so she devises a plan to steal the star s schematics. The schematics are located on the highly secure tropical planet Scarif. With the assistance of Chirrut Imwe (Donnie Yen) a blind spiritual leader Jyn and rebel intelligence officer Cassian (Diego Luna) infiltrate the planet with the goal of altering the balance of power in the Empire.<br><br>GREG: Scott Rogue One is a sort of Episode 3.5 in the Star Wars lineage. While it is billed as a standalone film it fits nicely between Star Wars: Episode 3 - Revenge of the Sith and 1977 s Star Wars: Episode 4 - A New Hope. The ending of Rogue One is the natural beginning to Episode 4. And herein lies the first of many problems with this film: we know how it must end. We know that the rebels must get the plans because Episode 4 starts with Princess Leia sending the plans to the dusty planet of Tatooine. And so there is no real tension in this story because we know our heroes will succeed. Another problem is a large number of so-called Easter Eggs. We see characters from Episode 4 pop up randomly and inexplicably throughout Rogue One. The cameos are intended to delight those of us who have watched Episode 4 since 1977 - but for me it was a distraction as I tried to remember where the characters came from and how they merge with this new film. And the epic nature of the film causes the first half of the film to be a series of vignettes rather than proper scenes. We are delivered first from planet to planet where snippets of the story are told. But we have very little time to get invested in any of the characters. This set up took nearly half the film and was quite dull.<br><br>SCOTT: If you re looking for Rogue One to move the great Star Wars story arc forward you re in for a disappointment. Rogue One is a prequel that introduces new characters whom we never seen in later installments so we pretty much know these characters are going to have to die. So not only do we know the outcome of the story we know what has to happen to our heroes. The only thing we don t know is exactly how it will happen. I would say that Rogue One is one of the better films in the Star Wars universe. I wasn t dazzled by this movie but it did several good things. For starters Rogue One stars Felicity Jones who does a fabulous job portraying a multi-faceted hero. I was impressed with how she demonstrated the physically heroic traits of strength and courage and combined them with a softer gentler side -- as evidenced when she saves a young child s life. For me this is an important step forward showing that stereotypically masculine traits need not be the only defining characteristics of heroes. What the movie industry now needs is male heroes who are portrayed in this same fuller way. The same hero can both kick ass and show a nurturant quality regardless of whether the hero is male or female.<br><br>GREG: I d like to say that Jyn undergoes a heroic transformation but she only goes through the motions. Aside from the prologue where we meet her as a child we meet Jyn as a fully formed rebel soldier. She s already been trained by her mentor Saw Gerrera and is recruited by the rebellion to find her father. But she s a loner. And the lesson she must learn is to depend upon others. The key word in Rogue One is hope. Her new sidekick Cassian Andor tells her that rebellions are built on hope. And then when the senate won t support an attack on a remote base she repeats this new lesson. But we never see Jyn undergo the transformation that shows us that she believes in the rebellion. She simply changes her tune because it makes for a convenient plot twist. And the moment you mention Scott where she saves the little girl is just inserted into the middle of a battle scene with little context. In writing circles we call this the save the cat moment. If you have a rough character and you want to soften her you have her save a cat from a tree (or some other such thing). And this is precisely what Jyn s saving the child does. However it s the only such scene we see - and it is antithetical to the rest of her personality as displayed in the story. Her ultimate transformation from a loner to a leader doesn t occur so much from a series of events that lead her inexorably to this new state - but by the writers simply putting her in the position of making an impassioned plea. There are no scenes that show her growing into this new leadership role. She simply becomes a leader because the story required it. It was a very disappointing presentation.<br><br>SCOTT: Well you ve put your finger on some of the perennially dissatisfying elements of the typical Star Wars film. They usually feature overly simplistic characters engaged in the classic battle between good and evil. For me Rogue One has a bit more depth and nuance than most Star Wars movies. Even the robot character K-2S0 (Alan Tudyk) is more interesting than past robots in this franchise. But the evil characters are monolithically pure evil which renders them uninteresting. They even manage to laugh at the carnage they wreak on the rebel forces. Psychological research on evil has shown that evil-doers typically do not enjoy performing their evil acts (click here for an interesting article on the psychology of evil by Roy Baumeister). I did enjoy seeing some mentoring especially from the spiritual Imwe whose blindness channels the ancient Greek archetype of the blind soothsayer in classic mythic tragedies. Interestingly this is the second movie we ve seen of late involving spiritual mentors the other one appearing in Doctor Strange.<br><br>GREG: I think we see a true mentor in Saw Gerrara but we never see the actual mentoring. Otherwise there is little mentoring going on here. Cassian offers an example of what the hero can look like - but he doesn t really give Jyn advice and gifts that help her manage the new situation she s in. Imwe is an interesting character. He seems like a failed Jedi as he doesn t quite channel the Force but does rely upon it. Again he offers some examples to Jyn on how to be a good hero but doesn t actually instruct her.<br><br>SCOTT: Rogue One is a visually beautiful movie with stunning CGI effects and memorable characters who captures the spirit of the Star Wars universe. Still I was less than dazzled by the story as it could only lead to one known final outcome. It also telegraphed the unhappy demise of our heroes. I hope that future Star Wars movies focus on advancing the story rather than giving us prequels that box themselves in artistically. I award this movie 3 Reels out of 5. Our main hero Jyn Erso traverses the hero s journey but as you point out Greg some key elements of the journey are implied as having taken place off-camera rather than shown to us. Jyn does receive assistance from friends and companions along the way and although we never see it she does undergo a transformation between her childhood and adulthood. Despite these disappointments I enjoyed seeing a hero who combines masculine and feminine qualities. I give Jyn a rating of 3 Hero points out of 5. As you emphasize Greg the mentors are shown to occupy key roles in our hero s life but we don t actually see much mentoring. The two main mentors Gerrara and Imwe are memorable characters but ultimately suffer from an unsatisfying emptiness in this story. I give them 2 Mentor points out of 5. Movie: Mentors: Heroes:<br><br>GREG: Rogue One is a skillfully crafted CGI fest that nestles nicely into the Star Wars universe. While I found it entertaining I was left feeling that good storytelling gave way to fan-boy fantasy. Just as with Star Wars: Episode 7: The Force Awakens we re given a female hero who has been left without her parents. It seems you can t be a Star Wars hero unless you re an orphan of some sort. The performances were fine but the script lacked originality and tension. I give Rogue One just 3 out of 5 Reels. The hero s journey is mostly off-screen and often implied when for the bits that are on-screen. Jyn does transform from a loner to a leader but it seems mainly as a result of the writers needs rather than anything that Jyn experiences. I can give Jyn only 2 out of 5 Heroes. And the mentorship here is lacking or non-existent. Saw Gerrera trains Jyn but it is only related to us in backstory never something we see on-screen. The other characters act as descent examples to Jyn but never step up to true mentors. I give only 1 out of 5 Mentor points to Rogue One.

 Compared to 'The Force Awakens' this is an entirely different beast with a darker grittier and far less camp tone. The plot is simple and what tension there could have been is somewhat lost due to the outcome being known but Edwards works with what he has and executes it well with beautifully shot visuals and action sequences that are a thrill to watch. The cast is stellar but their talents are unfortunately wasted on rather bland characters that have hardly any back story or development throughout making it difficult to establish any sort of deeper connection to them. It also has to be said that the film is very light on some of the more well-known elements such as Jedi Sith The Force etc. something that may upset and disappoint a lot of hardcore fans but is also entirely fitting considering the focus of the story: the Rebels. At the end of the day 'Rogue One' is less of a Star Wars story and more of a war story with a Star Wars twist and as such feels like a more mature entry into the franchise that manages to stay true to the original films whilst simultaneously changing the whole atmosphere to create something unique and entertaining. With a better script it could have been the best of them all., 3.5,  Late R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976628202/, August 16 2017, N/A

 A great War movie set in the Star Wars universe. The characters are well fleshed out the special effects are (as expected) incredible.

 [SPOILERS] I did not have high expectations for this film. And despite having arguably the greatest scene in the entire saga (Darth Vader VS The Rebels) my expectations were honoured. This film is comprised of 45% clichÃ (C) 45% plain character awfulness and 10% decency. It doesn't take a genius to spot the clichÃ (C)s in this film particularly within the first five or so minutes. I actually feel genuine hatred for Jyn Erso. I can't warm to her at all she has an antisocial personality which isolates her from the audience. Possibly my biggest issue with this this film is its existence. People argue that it is needed to clarify the weak spot in the Death Star but this could have been provided by a throw away line in any 'Star Wars' film Episode IV onwards.<br><br>Still though I will never forget my sheer joy at watching Erso's death.

 This is actually my favorite Star Wars movie plot wise. I'm aware that many will disagree but this film nails everything perfectly.

 It was a disappointment. Good parts but somehow a pastiche of a better film. More worryingly it's a clear trend towards a "dark side" in the franchise. I've always felt that Star Wars was such a success partly because it was a bold antidote to the almost universally miserable "noir" films of the era. For one thing excepting Obi Wan the main characters survived and rejoiced in that! Tastes change and we've a generally dark taste in plots at the minute hence films like Blood Father but speaking personally it would be a real shame to see more of an undermining of the bright (if often thrilling and "dangerous" genre) SPOILER Having pretty much all the characters obliterated was in my opinion a significant error although I suppose seeing them survive but not being in the later films was a significant hidden motive., 1.5,  G J, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976616106/, August 11 2017, N/A
 Fresh bold and exciting. Gareth Edwards does a really great job with this spinoff/prequel hybrid. The entire cast save for a glaringly cringey Forest Whitaker was excellent. I could do with a few less Felicity Jones pep-talks but the second half of the film lets her character flex her muscles. The second half is the better of the two and it really ends on a great note with easter eggs fan service and beauty all crammed into its 130 minutes runtime., 4.0,  David J, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/916389780/, August 11 2017, N/A
 Overall a pretty good movie. I like the somewhat darker tone that is evident in this film which hasn't been in other Star Wars films. Even though I like the overall story the whole it seemed to get of topic a little bit. tangent on Eadu seemed a bit out of place to me and it didn't really thicken the plot. I guess it was put there to give Jyn a reason to hate the Empire and to actually have a reason to support the Rebellion. It also didn't really follow the rule of "show dont tell". It just laid half the story before us instead of allowing it to unfold naturally. <br>Ben Mendelsohn's role as Director Krennic was my favorite but I was also a pretty big fan of Forest Whitacker's role as Saw but I wish they would have given him more screen time. One thing that I have to point out is that this film lacked a really epic score like most of the Star Wars films do. Don't get me wrong the music was good but i expected somthing that sent chills up my spine. Another thing that was very well done is all of the battle sequences were very well done both in space and on land. The last thing I gotta say is that I wish Star Wars would get away from the whole Death Star thing. If the seven films for of them have all been centered around a super weapon it being the Death Star in A New Hope Return of the Jedi and obviously this one and Star Killer Base in the Force Awakens. Despite its flaws it was still I good film., 3.0,  David H, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976304941/, August 11 2017, N/A

 Stunning effects that feel on par with the core Star Wars films. A great performance by Alan Tudyk as K2SO. The cgi created portrayal of Grand Moff Tarkin would leave most unaware that it was not an actual actor.

 I know I've gone through this the last several times I've reviewed movies released under their umbrella but I hate Disney. I really do. And I mean I hate Disney the corporation. I hate the fact that they know own Marvel and their entire catalog of heroes Star Wars and Pixar. It's good for film nerds but I think it sort of stifles creativity when everything you make has to meet the Disney seal of approval. That's why I'm hoping that Marvel never gets the rights to Deadpool back from 20th Century Fox. If Marvel gets Deadpool's film rights the entire thing will be a toned down PG-13 version of the same character we've grown to love. And I would absolutely hate that. There's some gleefully violent and profane about Deadpool that adhering to a strict PG-13 rating (as Disney will demand) will just take what makes Deadpool different from any other superhero away from him. He can still be irreverent and break the fourth wall but a much more toned down version of that. Having said all of that what they have done with the Star Wars franchise so far has actually been really fucking cool. The Force Awakens was the perfect mix of old and new and it brought the franchise back with a bang. I also love the idea of one-off stories like this telling a side story featuring different characters but set in the same gigantic universe. The reason I like this idea is because of the fact that quite frankly you can do absolutely anything you want creatively. Not that you don't have to adhere to the canon of this universe but you don't have to worry about leaving enough bits and pieces in order for you to make sequel after sequel. It allows you to tell more human stories in a universe that definitely needs them. Hell you can pretty much kill everyone off regardless if the characters are beloved or not because you don't have to worry about continuing with the story. And ***SPOILERS FOR FLIXSTER*** that is exactly what this movie did. I'll be entirely honest with you ladies and gentlemen I thought this movie was pretty damn great. I even thought that it was better than The Force Awakens. Let me explain what I mean by that. TFA was the re-boot of the franchise. It combined new and old elements to make something that felt fresh and exciting again. But it was also a movie that had to set up enough plot points to justify two more sequels. Therefore to me I believe that the best is yet to come for the Episode 8 and Episode 9 of the main Star Wars franchise. This movie on the other hand there's no real pressure since the story itself is self-contained. And I like how it uses a big 'how the fuck does that make sense' in the original Star Wars trilogy. And that was the destruction of the supposedly indestructible Death Star. This film quite simply tells the story of this ragtag group of misfits trying to find the plans for the Death Star's weakness in order to send it to the rebellion for them to destroy it. This group's goal isn't even to destroy the Death Star themselves. While this battle itself is more more scale in the arc of the original trilogy this group really are the unsung heroes of the entire franchise. They're not nameless or faceless but they might as well be given the fact that they won't likely receive any of the credit when the Death Star is eventually destroyed and the Empire is finally defeated. The Jedi are the ones who are gonna get all the credit. And I think that's what gives the film its strength. This group goes on this suicide mission not to receive credit for their contributions but just for their efforts to maybe lead to the defeat of the Empire. All of the characters are more than welcome additions to the franchise if even they're only alive for this lone film. You grow to pretty much love all of these misfits. I'm not saying there's an insane amount of character development but there's more than enough to make you buy into these characters and get a real sense of their personality. The narrative itself doesn't end on a super positive note (everyone literally dies). The Rebellion (and the Empire for that matter) lost the Battle of Scarif but their sacrifice will lead to better things in the future. So it's a definite bittersweet ending to be sure. The Battle of Scarif is absolutely tremendous. There's so much action going on and it never feels out of control. It's easy to follow and supremely well-edited. I don't know what else to say about the Battle of Scarif. It's just a top-notch chunk of action. If the film has a flaw is the fact that there's some scenes where it just drags. This after the Death Star's destruction of Jedha but before the Battle of Scarif. It's not so much of an issue since you're so invested in this world and these characters that they help to overcome some of these issues. The acting is really good all around. The casting is pretty damn great and varied. I don't really know what else I can say about this film? As mentioned the fact that they killed the entire Rogue One squad gave some added heft and meaning to the action. And it's the sort of story that changes how you view the original trilogy. Perhaps not by much but it does change it. The thing about these one-off films in the same universe is the fact that you can show that there's real consequences to be faced by your lead characters. They can't just avoid everything all the time like heroes often do. Eventually they were gonna get themselves stuck in a situation that they couldn't get out of. And that's what this film shows. It does a great job of giving weight and importance to the squad's actions. I don't really have anything else to say but I thought this was a great movie. It's got a few pacing issues here and there but those issues hurt less than you might think. Great action great characters and impressive usage of Star Wars lore makes this an easy recommendation from me. You don't even have to be a Star Wars nerd to like this though it would certainly help a lot., 4.0, , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/1202249/, July 23 2017, Super-reviewer
 I tried not be biased towards this movie especially with all the criticism. But I was entertained and I do like the fact that they tired really hard to stay in tune with the star wars galaxy.

 I don't want to be too critical of this film because it was a pretty good action flick set in the Star Wars universe. It just felt a little unnecessary. Did this story really need to be told. Maybe? I'll be mildly spoiling this movie by saying this but it's a pretty bleak movie in the same way The Dirty Dozen is. But even in that movie some of the team survives. It's just a shame that you feel like these characters got wasted for a meh story. If you love everything Star Wars you'll love this. If you want a simple action movie and like Star Wars it's okay.

 after seeing Rogue One- A Star Wars story overall i did liked it even though it was somewhat predictable ... There were certain stand out characters such as Lyn Cassian and Chirrut (Donnie Yen) yes there is still the familiar than new elements and surroundings. Storm troopers death star star fighting jets etc. <br><br>Of course Rogue One takes affects before the original New Hope Star Wars of `1977 so of course we have to see the same ole's of old. <br>but in terms of the CGI special effect graphics the action sequences the character portrayal role and the dark roles storylines and climatic ending made it very interesting a good return investment. <br><br>And the CGI wasn't just the action-parts but bringing in appearances of the late Peter Cushing's role of Grand Moff Tarkin as well as Princess Leia (the late Carrie Fisher)  the imaging effect was so realistic and well I was wonder how they were able to accomplished that feat. <br>Oddly there was some critics and controversy of the computer imaging of these characters <br><br>I liked the music score during film I wasn't as keen fond of the robot that always wanted to follow Jyn and Cassian around as other viewers were no harm but I could live with or without it. The humor wasn't always there but for the most part I liked the speed of to the point of the movie. I thought it had a good start and developing point  It only slowed during the middle but it picked up again on it's way to a climatic finish. <br><br>I got a vibe from Jyn as I did for Ryn (Force Awakens) as a relentless rebellion freedom fighter - but of course Jyn doesn't have " the force" like Ryn does. I had heard that Rogue one is going to be the first film of a trilogy <br><br>I think a lot of traditional hard core Star War fans may have a problem with this film as it does not use open with the traditional signature black-screen text at the very beginning of the film such as "A long time ago in a galaxy far far away...."and so on to describing the background of the film. Maybe SW fans may grunt about it  but I had no problem with as it feels like a experiencing a different way of viewing a new Star Wars film. <br><br>Rogue One : A Star Wars story ...

 Really well done. A smaller Star Wars story with a human struggle and some tragedy. Filled with a roster of unlikables who earn some redemption with their just cause. Loved the ending and liked how nicely and subtly it connects the two trilogies. Didn't like the addition of AT-ATs though this movie cheapened them., 4.0,  Carlos I, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/782659076/, July 16 2017, N/A

 "Rogue One - a film that knows what the audience wants and doesn't hesitate to push the boundaries a little bit. Its a war film that starts out promising then gets lost in transition but builds up to the final 30 minutes which is brisk thrilling and packing a surprising emotional weight. Felicity Jones does a great job as the leading lady and the supporting cast is no exception. Funny how this spin off is more engaging than the lackluster Force Awakens that we saw in 2015. I had hoped it to be the opposite which is why I was thoroughly impressed as I left the cinema that night maybe it was my low expectation that garnered a 4/5 star review from me.", 4.0,  Li Hui C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976517711/, July 15 2017, N/A
 Another great entry into the Star Wars universe. Whilst not technically a Star Wars film (i.e. a definitive episode) it still has all those elements we love and more. There are enough in jokes/references and nostalgia to keep the hardcore fan happy and enough new story and relevant characterisation to bring in a new audience and indeed keep them there. The film retains an 70s feel whilst still residing firmly in a modern (or rather futuristic) environment...albeit in a galaxy far far away. The hairstyles moustaches and even clothing is a subtle yet pleasing touch and very appropriate. The film echos the gritty visuals of A Force Awakens and looks like it could still fit in with the motifs/style of the originals. Jones and Luna are great and carry the film with ease. I also loved K2 and his brutal honesty brilliantly voiced by Alan Tudyk. The perfect comic foil for all the intense narrative and explosive action. <br>The tension is built and maintained well and is quite powerful despite us all knowing how the story works out. The new characters in the 'team' are also very likeable and this makes 'that' ending that much more difficult to swallow.<br>The requisite links to A New Hope work well and I'm sure will delight fans. Iconic characters do of course show up and whilst I liked them....I do have mixed feelings over some things. The revival of some characters through the use of CGI had varying results. Moff Tarkin at first felt jarring but I soon got used to the CGI and actually forgot after a while. The voice is spot on. However Leia's brief time on screen was badly done in my opinion and felt very out of place. This is possibly because you don't have time to adapt...but still sloppy work I feel. Vader whilst ultimately badass during fights didn't feel right either. Possibly as James Earl Jones is now older and the voice (as much as you try) will never sound the same.<br>The film comes down a star for its moments of cheesiness. The script often skirts the edge of 'corny' and then thankfully veers away back into impassioned and powerful. However there are moments that can't be saved and unfortunately these were fairly noticeable. A Vader line in particular made me shake my head in disappointment (you will know which one).<br>Overall I really enjoyed myself and am looking forward to the next Episode and spin-off., ni,  Michael P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/484289161/, July 15 2017, N/A

 All-time favorite Star Wars movie. The flawless mix of the old universe with the new technology was cunning edge material bringing back old friends characters and props back where they belong. Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) was amazing along with her Rogue One crew. Glad they explained everyone's background story in the beginning. The build up to the final fight scene on Scarif was perfection. The final fight scene itself well cmon did you really think you'd be let down? Almost wished that the fight scenes were a little more brutal but considering the company is owned by Disney the move to keep it kid friendly while still giving the older more mature audience a show is respected., 5.0,  Cole S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976502793/, July 5 2017, N/A
 I don't know if I would say that this is one of my favorite Star Wars movies but Rogue One is an interesting movie to watch to see how the death star came to be and it does serve decently as a movie to take place in between the events of Revenge Of The Sith and A New Hope., 3.5,  Peyton M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/963763146/, July 5 2017, N/A

 I've had to think a long time of whether or not this is the greatest Star Wars movie of all time. I'm still unsure where it places in the pantheon of films but at the very least Rogue One is in the top 3. The reason behind this is very simple... it focuses on the "unimportant" characters... the people BEHIND the important galactic events and figures and uses a rallying cry of Power to the People. In all of the other films the main characters are the elite of the elite the big movers and shakers of incredible importance but Rogue One is the opposite. It shows the excesses the truth and violence and what it really took to sustain the Rebellion. The heroes are far less glamorous and are far more human even if they aren't technically human. We all like to think that if we were somehow how in this universe we'd be a very important person but more than likely we'd just be a face in an endless sea of beings. Rogue One is the beautiful homage to all of us plebs that try our best make a huge difference but will never be known..., 5.0,  Zach T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/783732637/, July 4 2017, N/A

 I'm a big fan of films like Where Eagles Dare and The Guns of Navarone war movies in which a crew of specialists team up to steal a thing or blow a thing up or kill a bunch of bad guys in an impenetrable...thing. I'm also a big fan of Star Wars. And this movie is a combination of those two things which is incredibly cool. Not only is it cool as a concept but it's damn good as a movie too. It's thrilling funny and fun like any good Star Wars but with that harder edge of a proper war movie. Gareth Edwards gives it a visual style which is different to the numbered episodes - I hate to use the word but 'gritty' best describes it - but the production and costume design are very much Episode IV era Star Wars with original flourishes that are realistic variations on what we've already seen so it slides right in while looking and feeling fresh.<br><br>The story is compelling on its own but also expands the overall Star Wars narrative tying together elements of the original trilogy the prequels as well as the Clone Wars and Rebels TV series. Most importantly it gives more impact to A New Hope. Before this the only display we had of the Death Star's power was that one bloodless sequence of Alderaan's destruction. Rogue One throws us right into the middle of a Death Star attack (two actually) showing its effect on the ground and putting our heroes right in amongst it.<br><br>And these are great characters. Free from Skywalker family shenanigans Rogue One establishes an all-new rabble of rowdy rebels for us to follow and cheer for. Central to the story is Jyn Erso a heroine as gutsy and capable as Leia Rey or Padme but more flawed and realistic. This being her only film she is given a definite arc and it's very fulfilling to see her follow it through. Felicity Jones is fantastic in the role. Rebel lifer Cassian Andor played by Diego Luna who is this film's ostensible Solo/Dameron spacedude character is also more human than Han or Poe more tone-appropriate than another wisecracking 'scoundrel' would have been. Tudyk is fine as ever adding another starpilot AND another CGI robot to his resume. Donnie Yen (yay!) and Jiang Wen make a cool odd-couple buddy duo as the Guardians of the Whills (a nice Lucasy touch). Riz Ahmed is great value as always.<br><br>But Mendo is the winner as the evil Director Krennic. On paper he's probably a fairly standard smarmy villain type but he's played with twitchy shouty Mendo brilliance. Classic.<br><br>Mads is Mads is Mads. Genevieve O'Reilly is a great fit as Mon Mothma - glad she got to reprise the role after being almost completely deleted from RotS. Smits is fine. Bail has a couple of fun moments - discussing tracking down his old Jedi pal for help his choice of courier to deliver the plans etc. <br><br>In fact there are many moments peppered throughout that tie this film to Ep IV - the dudes from the cantina the rebel pilots (including the original Red Five who conveniently and spectacularly buys it leaving the designation vacant for a certain hotshot kid) and others - that don't get in the way of the story at all Star Wars noobs would think nothing of them. But it's nice to see they've studied the existing films etc to make sure it fits into the world flawlessly. I noticed none of the kind of contradictions or shoehorning we got with the prequels.<br><br>Another great thing about the movie is that it has made Vader a badass again. After the prequels came out whenever I revisited the originals my perception of Vader was tainted by the impression that under the helmet he was just a whiny punk. He was kind of ruined as a villain for me. But the way he's portrayed in Rogue One - from his creepy lair on Mustafar to the way he ruthlessly ploughs through rebel soldiers in the final sequence - restores him to his former status.<br><br>The movie does however have a couple of flaws. The CGI re-creation of Peter Cushing is a noble attempt at inserting a photoreal digital character among live actors but the technology is not quite there to make it perfect. When he's standing silently it's fine - no dead eyes. But as soon as he speaks the jig is up - the mouth movements don't pass for real. Furthermore while Guy Henry has a similar facial structure to Cushing and manages a good approximation of his voice he's noticeably taller than Pete. Even the CGI Leia's speech isn't entiely convincing and she only says one syllable. This is the sort of thing that is only going to look more and more fake as effects improve in the future and not in a charming way. These are human characters that don't look fully human which pulls you out of the scene. <br><br>Another issue which I don't hold against the movie because it can't really be helped is that James Earl Jones's voice now sounds like that of a man in his 80s and doesn't match ANH era Vader. Then again it would have been more of a problem if they'd recast. I dunno maybe he's just a bit croaky from the bacta tank or something :)<br><br>Overall the first out-and-out war movie of the Star Wars series makes itself a vital part of the saga through sheer bravado and will giving us new characters to love and then putting them through hell in a highly entertaining way.

 A spin off with a very small premise as the back story to a single line in the original series. I am more surprised than anyone to say this is one of the finest outings in the franchise. Glorious picturesque and heart rending.

 Fantastic! The Force is STRONG With this One!<br><br>Originally Written December 16 2016 --<br>Former scientist Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) lives on a farm with his wife and young daughter Jyn. His peaceful existence comes crashing down when the evil Director Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) takes him away from his beloved family to work on a weapon of immense power. Many years later Galen is now the Empire's lead engineer for the most powerful weapon in the galaxy the Death Star. Knowing that her father holds the key to its destruction a vengeful Jyn (Felicity Jones) joins forces with Rebel spy Captain Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) and other resistance fighters to steal the space station's plans for the Rebel Alliance.<br>Wow! What an incredible film! For the first time in Star Wars cinematic history we get a story that leads directly into another Star Wars film in this case the original 1977 masterpiece. The words we read in that iconic crawl almost 40 years ago "Rebel spies steal the Death Star plans" is exactly the story that "Rogue One" shows us. And it is incredible! We get a film that truly shows the horror of the galactic war that has been going on throughout the galaxy and how desperate the Rebel Alliance is to gain a victory. So many amazing surprises and "Star Wars" Easter eggs are sprinkled throughout "Rogue One" but the best part is that this is the prequel all "Star Wars" fans have been dying to see.

 This movie is conflicted. It seems to want to forge its own way and be a gritty harsh sad brutal war story but has to fit that into the star wars universe that crams as much tacked on nostalgia as possible in order to sell toys.

 It's not a feel-good Disney movie but there is enough comic relief and a fast enough pace to make the movie move at an enjoyable pace. Mostly all original characters but very much connected to the overall Star Wars narrative. Rogue One shows some of the more complicated inner-workings of the rebellion. It's not totally spelled out but this movie starts to hint that the Rebellion is not as good or pure as it has been portrayed in the earlier Star Wars movies., 3.0,  Dave W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/798906327/, June 29 2017, N/A
 Rogue One ties into A New Hope seamlessly and it takes every chance it can to connect the two which is a strength and weakness. Learning how the Death Star came out how it did and how the plans were recovered for the Rebels is awesome stuff. Seeing countless cameos that added nothing to the film (except a few minutes to the runtime) was less awesome. Some were great mind you but some you could feel the whole crew winking at you. "You remember this? Yeah these are characters that exist!". It also starts out strong with a flashback to our main heroine's childhood then immediately slows down as we assemble this rag tag team. Once the film gets going though it goes and the last act is truly something to behold.

 A<br>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is a brilliant Star Wars film. It is utterly astounding that Disney and Lucasfilm has set the bar for their stand alone films incredibly high. Rogue One hits all of the points that make a phenomenal Star Wars film: nostalgic references to the past check ascetics such as Production design gorgeous cinematography amazing set pieces check fantastic characters (Jyn Krennic Cassian K-2SO Chirrut) and a perfect ending. The only negative was the quick-cutting pacing and the abrupt quick and over the top scene at the beginning. Otherwise Rogue One is phenomenal I'll just say it phenomenal.

 Very well done and a great story to bridge the Star Wars films. Overall not my favorite but definitely up there. Felicity Jones does a solid job with her character. It can be easy to overdo that character and yet she kept it contained and executed a great performance.

 An exciting new spin to the franchise commemorative of the original trilogy while linking to the prequels.

 I dont know WHO is giving this movie positive reviews but this is just awful.. Its neat to see it from a different perspective but the acting is just horrid.. the female protagonist is one of the WORST actors Ive ever seen.. The dialog is laughable (even Darth Vader at one point says something completely juvenile.. Using Force Choke "Dont choke on your asperations commander"... So corney and not Vader at all).. <br><br>The opening 30mins is a constant jump around with no clue by the viewer whats going on and who is who..<br><br>Forrest Whitacker does an equally cringe job acting as the female lead.. <br><br>Basically the entire movie is the lead designer of the original Death Star and how he was conflicted in doing so and so built in the ridiculous plot to the original Star Wars.. Deliberately designing the weakness for the rebellion.. <br><br>Its just all around bad even if it was a neat idea to see the original Star Wars on a different point of view and around a single point of interest... It just wasnt good... AT ALL!, 1.5,  Jimmy C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976433017/, June 10 2017, N/A
 This was a great addition to the Start Wars saga. I loved how I felt like I knew the story from my upbringing and it fit right in with all the side stories. I appreciated how they remade two of the original characters in CG and did a pretty good job of it. of course since I noticed it wasn't an ideal job. I was questioning whether he looked weird with plastic surgery on his super old age or if it was CG. The story was a great tale that requires no follow up. It helps bridge the gap between the first generation of Star Wars fans to the new fans while scoring higher on originality than Episode 7., 5.0,  Charlton B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/893289905/, June 10 2017, N/A

 Rogue One had a heart-pounding final act but the movie was mostly tedious. Too many characters who weren't fleshed out and the only death that had any weight was the robot's. It added a little to the mythology (like the Dreamers--those who can use the Force but aren't Jedi) while not detracting from the series which makes it better than the other prequels. It definitely doesn't work as a stand-alone movie despite what the ads say. I have a feeling the uninitiated would find this confusing and boring., 3.0,  Dustin D, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/906114068/, June 8 2017, N/A
 A day later and still it sits heavy. Dark story about a group of unsung heros in the Star Wars storyline. A beautifully created film it was a pleasure to exist in the stunningly realized universe I've known and loved since I was a child. The story is necessarily bleak (it's what happened). I do feel like the ending got a bit muddled all the crazy bunkers and beaches and the insanity of opening up the gate to transmit a sign...it just got too messy. Not a perfect film but enjoyable and gorgeous. The day after and already I look forward to watching it again., 3.5,  Turri V, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/975630778/, June 7 2017, N/A
 Pretty good in-between Star Wars flick. While it doesn't necessarily stand out as a great Star Wars film it still had a more thought-out story and was significantly better than the recent Episode VII: The Force Awakens.

 Is "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" the best Star Wars film since "The Empire Strikes Back"? Simply put no. It is a step in the right direction in terms of anthology films though. Disney took a lot of risks with Rogue One. It mixes some familiar assets with new perspectives in a really well done way. We get to see a more in-depth look at the rebellion and all it's assets. The rebels are portrayed more as cells that have almost reluctantly joined together to remove the Empire instead of being one unified force. We see them bicker and make questionable decisions which adds a layer of depth to what we see in later films. The rebel alliance isn't the shining beacon of good we always assumed and it's cool to see. One of the films greatest aspects is its sense of scale. Director Gareth Edwards is a master of this. Through size and some excellent visual effects he shows the raw power and size of the Empire and their new super weapon. Many of the visuals are breathtaking and leave a lasting impression. The cinematography is great and is reminiscent of war films recent and old. Where the film suffers is in some of its character and writing. The main characters are well acted but are ultimately disposable. Some standouts are Donnie Yen Diego Luna Allen Tudyk and Ben Mendelsohn. They definitely elevate the material they are given and add much needed charisma. Much of the main cast feels like they had scenes that were cut and some scenes were obviously added later from re-shoots. The films score is also very hit or miss at times which is understandable given the amount of time Michael Giacchino had to score the film. Other than those gripes Rogue One is a solid Star Wars film that fits neatly next to A New Hope. It has great action and tells an overall interesting story. It's third act is incredible and perfectly fits the "war film feel" Gareth Edwards was going for., 3.5,  Michael G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976314583/, June 3 2017, N/A
 As soon as it started I was disappointed. Who makes a Star Wars movie without the beginning paragraph!! Reguardless if it's only a mear add on. SECOND When showing the title they didn't even use the classic Star Wars music! None of the original theme music was used! I refused to watch it after 10 mins it's a disgrace in my opinion.

 After the absolute disappointment that was the Force Awakens I was glad to find this to be rather engrossing. We actually meet and follow NEW people with diverse goals (that eventually come together as one) making hard-time war decisions due to which are protagonists that aren't so noble but were more interesting as such. Unlike the gutlessness of FA this film had very tense moments due to the unpredictability of its characters something the SW desperately needs if it wants any hope of being fresh. The primary feature I found most appealing was how gritty it was in comparison to the rest of the franchise. This is not to mean it's look as its cinematography has never made the galaxy far far away look better. I mean more of its tone. The movie was definitely a fun ride in a similar way as episodes 4 and 6 were simultaneous juggling multiple aspects of a space battle. However up until this film the term "war" in the title never really had much weight given the tone of most of the series (save episode 5) has been saturated in levity. This film very much felt like a space WAR with as mentioned usually honorable people having to make ignoble decisions and the quick unceremonious death of allies. Overall I was quite pleased with this film but unlike the ending the crew of Rogue One fought to provide I have little hope for episodes proceeding from 7 given the kiss-ass direction they're seemingly taking., 4.0,  Nemo P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/949125778/, July 12 2017, N/A

 As a life-long avid Star Wars fan I've come to the sad conclusion that nothing will ever match the magic of the originals. Whether that is because I'm old now or because the new films just aren't as good is up for argument. Fans will love this film for the plethora of references to the original trilogy and how awesomely it segues into the original Star Wars movie. But anyone who isn't a fan will see through the plot holes poor writing and ill-conceived story. Because the story occurs between the originals and the prequels I thought that this film might stand on its own but it definitely does not. The entire story is heavily embedded in Star Wars lore especially the original trilogy so you need to be a fan to enjoy it. It's basically a prologue of the original Star Wars and there are more nods to the Holy Trilogy than you can wave a lightsaber at. For the most part the tie-ins to the originals are handled very well and this film even answers a question that has baffled fans for nearly 40 years. It also features some solid performances that overcome the film's propensity towards the melodramatic... with the exception of Forrest Whitaker whose performance is cringe-inducing it's so bad. For me the standouts were Diego Luna Ben Mendelsohn and Alan Tudyk who provides the much-needed comic relief voicing K-2SO who is essentially C-3PO with an attitude. The problem with this film lies in the storytelling. This film is about the rebel plot to infiltrate the Empire and steal the Death Star plans but this makes up less than half the movie. Most of the run-time is spent developing the hero's back-story which isn't really relevant to the actual plot. Its biggest failing is that it spends literally zero time building the camaraderie of the Rogue One band of rebels. Without that you don't feel anything at their loss (sorry but it's pretty apparent that not all of them are going to make it out of this). Not to mention that it turns out to not even be a 'plot' at all! I had hoped that this movie would be more of a spy thriller within the Star Wars universe but alas the rebels' master plot is less "Mission: Impossible" and more "Leeroy Jenkins". It's all pretty preposterous how it goes down. It's upsetting because it didn't have to be that way with a little tweaking the story could have built a lot more tension and also made the 'Rogue One' crew seem less like impulsive idiots who got really really lucky. Beyond that I appreciated that this film actually has an original story (unlike The Force Awakens) and does not sacrifice that story in favor of style or special effects. Though the big sky-battle sequence is pretty epic the real story is about the boots on the ground and that's exactly where it should be. I just wish the characters were more developed and that the actual plot to recover the Death Star plans took more precedence (and also wasn't stupid). Despite its flaws it's an enjoyable movie with a super awesome ending but it could have been so much more., 3.5,  Dana F, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/901390149/, July 10 2017, N/A

 I am giving this movie a 10/10 based on its narrative and its ability to inspire sympathy for the main characters.<br><br>My thoughts on the "Star Wars" franchise as a whole is as follows: I think the Star Wars franchise would benefit greatly from a backstory on the origins of "the force" itself along with the origins of the "light" and "dark" sides of it.<br><br>Throughout the 40 year history of the Star Wars franchise the viewing audience has had to merely accept that the force just exists and that people willingly choose either light or dark.<br><br>I believe a backstory regarding the creation of the force whether it has secret religious designations and whether or not it is being actively manipulated by a celestial supreme being is in order. Also how is it "alive"? Is it God?<br><br>With an explanation of these questions the viewing audience can better grasp and better put into context the series of events as presented in the Star Wars franchise as a whole and can better understand decisions made by characters and the implications of circumstances in the Star Wars collection., 5.0,  Emmanuel Isaiah S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976508819/, July 9 2017, N/A

 Given that I reviewed Star Wars: The Force Awakens last year as a Star Wars fan by my own definition I thought I would offer my own opinions on the newest installation of the franchise. These are of course my own opinions.<br>While Rogue One isn't a mainstream Star Wars movie some have hailed it as superior fare to the prequels and a match for the originals with this in mind I will treat it with the same Star Wars zeal as I would for any other.<br>First and to be congratulated heartily for it as well Rogue One corrects the fatal flaw of the Force Awakens in its laudable creativity from a plethora of planets unique vehicles and species Rogue One for me was what the Force Awakens should have been: highly respectful of the originals NOT a copy of them. The Empire in particular was done well with an array of vehicles and new stormtroopers what the movie does best is its impressive sweeping visuals of planetary proportions. One confidence I did have going into Rogue One was in its director: Gareth Edwards who also directed Godzilla. While that was a so-so movie he knew how to set up great scenes. (Those Death Star and AT-AT scenes!!!) - side note: the blast radius of those AT-ATs was very small...<br>The knowledge of the Star Wars universe in the movie made me appreciate the movie that much more: the Endar Spire from Knights of the Old Republic? The Stormtroopers talking about the T-15? And many others allowed for a more reminiscent Star Wars experience. It showed that the makers actually cared about researching Star Wars lore which is a plus.<br>That being said the movie was not without its faults some of which disappointed me highly. Please keep in mind that these are general movie points and less Star Wars movie points though the frivolous treatment of the force and mediocre music are dismaying patterns carried over from the Force Awakens. But as I have already discussed such treatment in my previous review I will concentrate more on what is unique to Rogue One.<br>Fault Number One: The characters. This was a little shocking considering it was something the Force Awakens did very well and disappointing for Disney's record. None of these characters from Jyn to Cassian feel human save for the only nonhuman the reprogrammed Imperial Droid - K-2SO -  though the defected Imperial Pilot comes tantalizingly close. They serve merely as conduits for the continuation of the story rather than participants in the story itself. This is manifested best but not exclusively through the movie's dialogue. <br>Fault Number Two: THE DIALOGUE IS CANDY. Explanation: In the originals the prequels or even (yes even) the Force Awakens dialogue statements required thought and could give long lasting sustenance (less in the prequels): "I'm looking for a great warrior." "Wars make not one great." "The reward would be more than you could imagine!" "I don't know I can imagine quite a bit." The dialogue from Rogue One is designed for function yet nearly every sentence uttered merely restates what the audience should already feel from its laudably powerful visuals. A good way to prove this point (true or false) is to watch the movie on mute. As a silent movie Rogue One does quite well. The audience hardly learns anything different in the movie from its dialogue and in fact could possibly interpret their own dialogue for a more engrossing emotional experience. Take Rogue One's opening scene: everyone can discern what is going on without auditory aid. The second purpose of the dialogue in Rogue One is entertainment for the moment: K-2SO when a fellow droid is shot "You knew that wasn't me?" Donnie Yen's funny "I am blind!" "I will be with you...the Captain said I had to." "Rebellion begins with hope." "I am one with the Force the Force is with me."<br>None of these statements require any form of thought save for whatever generalities an individual can scrounge up to attribute meaning. ("Rebellion begins with hope." Yes...so does every Bank Heist. So does every War of Conquest. I would have thought Rebellion began with frustration anger violence or something that would induce people to take up arms against either injustice or indifference. Instead it serves as a vague reminder of that movie that made lots and lots of cash.)<br>The characters didn't seem to be cared for: none (with the exception of K-2SO and ALMOST the Imperial Pilot) grew at all during the progression of this film. Thus when the end came and the blast from the Death Star was about to consume the two protagonists on the beautiful sunlit beach after delivering its plans so that others might fight on - a scene of potentially great emotion - I felt something wrong: nothing. In fact I wanted them to get the scene over with so that we could get back to the space battle above. The characters were not given time nor the quality to be fleshed out. I wanted to feel for them however these were character TYPES not PEOPLE thus while each were given strong introductions they never developed beyond them which was frustrating given their strong introductions.<br>Fault Number Three: The first half of the movie follows modern storytelling techniques (rapid changing of scenes/flashback merging) a problem I feel that transcends Star Wars in movies video games and literature alike so I will not dwell on the subject for the purpose of this review. It replicates the so-called 'stream of consciousness' that undermines (remember of course these are my opinions) the foundation of good story-telling. By contrast the originals (except perhaps Six) were excellently paced in reflection/action.<br>And last Fault Number Four: When will the Stormtroopers learn to aim? Remember when Jyn is in the middle of the street with Cassian after saving that crying girl and Stormtroopers round the corner with a straight shot at her? I counted six misses (and she hardly even moved!!!) but I think there were more. During the final battle Stormtroopers witlessly funnel themselves out with the coordination of a Call of Duty random Deathmatch. Only the dark troopers were okay but they decided to forget their training at the end. (Would have been cooler if Donnie Yen had been shot multiple times but still he moved forward...)<br>As a personal note concerning the severity of my particular concerns: I rebuke the movie because it's Star Wars. I enjoy Star Wars more so than many other movies and it holds a special place in my creative and artistic development. I enjoyed Rogue One it is NOT a bad movie. It is a fine movie. Is it a good Star Wars movie? No. It is as if the Force Awakens and Rogue One traded concepts! Characters for creativity: of the two creativity is more pertinent for me as Star Wars so naturally I prefer Rogue One's direction for future Star Wars Movies. But characters are more pertinent to me for a movie. Why can we not have both? Moana had efficient dialogue with more meaning in its first song than Rogue One in its entire movie! I know Disney can do it.<br>But again I see all over media outlets an inundation of praise and excitement. The heart of Star Wars as we saw happen in the Prequels is lost amid the fantastic laser sound effects the explosions the cameos and that is all Star Wars fans seem to require. For me Star Wars created a culture and like all cultures it had MEANING. Like Tolkien's Lord of the Rings it incorporated real mythology and theology into its universe from Christian Chivalry to influences from Sophocles' plays. It is living and vibrant and real despite being far far away.<br>I am willing to give Disney one last chance for Star Wars Episode 8. I pray everyone else is right in assuming Disney merely copied Episode 4 for 7 to 'establish a firm foundation' in order to spring to more creative and meaningful content. Otherwise this feels like the end of times for Star Wars: a repetitive nature fueled far more by corporate interests than artistic and powered by fans unable or unwilling to see the difference.<br>Thank you., 3.0,  David Y, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/907970032/, July 8 2017, N/A

 Rogue One a Star Wars story is a unique installment in a long lasting franchise of reoccurring events with different labels. The plot takes place between the prequels and original trilogy where an important feature of the galaxy specifically the empire is addressed. As Jin follows her quest to stop the empire from ruling the galaxy she encounters many individuals with grand and humorous personalities. Although there is no noticeable continuation into a future sequel of the unknown this movie remains unpredictable and ties in beautifully to the events of a new hope. There is no doubt visuals go a long way in the world of Star Wars and rogue one is a big step up from previous installments.

 Star Wars: Rogue One falls somewhere in the middle of the franchise for me. Definitely not anywhere near the top. I found that it had exactly zero emotional impact due to the fact that you knew exactly what had to happen right from the start so I wasn't able to really care about any of the characters. The whole crew was fun and the story engaging enough but the emotional impact simply lacking. This was the fault of the story being covered however and not of the writers directing or actors. <br><br>While I respect the choice not to use an opening crawl having it simply blink in from black with an orchestra hit looked like the way a college kid's student film would begin. Very amateurish and reeked of a last-minute decision. At very least a fade-in with a gradual rise in music would've played better and less jarring. <br><br>The elephant in the room the entire film: Tarkin looked freaking horrible. Every time he appeared on screen it took me right out of the film. It was like they dumped a video game character in the middle of the movie. Prosthetics have come a long way and they could've done a reasonable facsimile of him with makeup...but Lucasfilm has to do everything digital...and mo-cap Does. Not. Work. On. People. Leia worked well enough but that was because she was on screen for all of six seconds. Tarkin was a pure cgi FAIL.<br><br>For a movie that was purported to "solve a major plot hole in Star Wars" (The Death Star having a weakness which was never a plot hole to begin with) it sure introduced a lot of new plot holes. For example apparently you can take down a Star Destroyer with nothing more than 4 Y-Wings which begs the question why the Alliance didn't load up on Y-Wings and take out the whole Imperial fleet. <br><br>Also what happened to all those awesome new ships and troop types we saw in there? You know death troopers single wing TIEs the U-Wing fighter/troop transport that never show up in ANH ESB or RotJ? Oops they never show up again because they were a new invention in a film that took place before the other three and the filmmakers couldn't resist tinkering. And you know Disney had to sell some new toys.<br><br>But Vader was badass so that made up for a lot.<br><br>The good: the story was engaging enough and it's neat that we now see how the plans got into Leia's hands. The cast did the best they could and turned over stellar performances under difficult circumstances. The directing was excellent and the cinematography everything I want from a Star Wars film. I own the Blu Ray and I do re-watch it. It's Star Wars so I love it from top to bottom. It's just that there were problems that could've been fixed with a bit more attention the CGI was poor and the story they chose to portray had an herculean task to get us to care about the characters., 3.0,  Jason V, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/867364326/, July 6 2017, N/A

 I thought that was a 3 star movie all the way until the end! And then I loved the ending! And the way it connects right into "A New Hope"! I also really enjoyed all the cameos from characters in the original 3 - none more so than Walrus Man and his pal! Of the new characters I liked the duo of Baze Malbus and Chirrut Îmwe quite a lot!

 Rogue one was a movie that tried to be dark and real but only accomplished this in the second half of the movie due to the first half having a clunky plot that doesn't seem to get anywhere until she returns to the rebels from the secret mission to kill her dad. Now I would rate higher because of the pretty good 2nd half with an amazing action scene with Vader to really finish up the movie but the character of Jyn Urso is unbelievably bland! In cinema there are two types of protagonist an active protagonist that makes things happen and a passive protagonist where things happen to it. Jyn is a passive protagonist if I've ever scene one (pun) and it just seems as if she never does anything without. Being told to do so by some else., 2.0,  Kamil M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/949654624/, June 2 2017, N/A
 This was a solid movie. Obviously it's not the original trilogy or TFA but it delivers an interesting watch. Alan Tudyk's performance was very funny.

 Like Harry Potter I was in love with Star Wars growing up thanks to my dad. I loved every character planet and creature in the galaxy and after how great The Force Awakens was I couldn't be more excited for every Star Wars film that comes after it. In comes Rogue One an anthology film to fill in until we get The Last Jedi and I wasn't sure if Disney could nail this out of the park like they did with The Force Awakens. In the end my expectations were unrealistic because Rogue One was perfect for the story behind the whole film. Every character has a purpose and every battle is breathtaking whether it's in or out of space. We are also finally given a beautifully-crafted space battle something that we didn't really get in The Force Awakens. Possibly the best moment of the whole film is right at the end with Darth Vader going full-badass and wrecking havoc. The only problem I had with this film was the score but it's probably because John Williams wasn't behind it. That is truly one of the only problems with the film other than that I thought this was a perfect treat for those that were around for A New Hope and it makes me more excited for more Star Wars Stories., 4.5,  Connor M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/918171550/, May 30 2017, N/A

 Oups! I just realized that for some reason this movie had fallen between the cracks. It was quite some time since I watched it but I seem to have forgotten to write a post about it.<br><br>For me this was one of the best of the new (after the original trilogy) Star Wars movies. It was fun entertaining with plenty of good old-fashioned Star Wars action. I generally do not like prequels but this time I felt it was nice to get a bit of the background to the statement that "a number of spies died to get this information" in episode IV. We were even provided with a bit of an explanation as to why the Death Star had this silly weakness in the first place.<br><br>The actors were doing a decent enough job of it. The chatty android was fun without being totally silly. It was a nice roller coaster ride of action improvisations and gung ho ludicrous stunts inside and outside of various forms of transportation means.<br><br>As usual with Star Wars the science part of science fiction is somewhat lacking. What looks cool is what is put on the screen and screw science. When reading books I am more sensitive to such things but for a Star Wars movie it works well enough.<br><br>Some people seem to be dissecting the characters and dialogue trying to put logic into it as well as wanting to have more emotions and "character development". Come on! It is a Star Wars movie. It is supposed to be all action and visually stunning.<br><br>On that this movie delivers. Sure the plot is not really the most developed one and has plenty of faults.

 Rogue One is the first in a trilogy of Star Wars anthology movies but essentially it is Episode III (and a half!)- set before 'A New Hope' it's plot revolves around a band of rebels (lead by the very strong Felicity Jones) and how they risked life and limb to retreive plans for the Imperial superweapon the Death Star. This is a very slick aesthetically stunning film with remarkable effects and classic Star Wars motifs. Having said that and despite its premise it never feels entirely retro or nostalgic for the sake of it. The cast are mostly young and fresh despite the odd familiar face and visually it is toned down to affect an almost noirish low-key atmosphere. To be honest the central characters didn't engage me for the bulk of the film and their plight seemed secondary to the action sequences (such as the killing of stormtroopers the most useless soldiers in the universe!) but the excitement and momentum in the last stretch of the movie was palpable. I particularly liked the 'Pacific theatre of War styled' battle sequence complete with Imperial Walkers. Also Darth Vader's serious ass-whooping at the end of the film where he fends off rebels with his lightsabre and use of the force- it has to be said- is one of the most brilliantly staged and choreographed scenes in the whole series! The only effects that were not so convincing were the CGI renderings of Peter Cushing bringing him back from the dead as Emperor Tarkin. Some of his facial movements were a bit too smooth but this is a relatively minor concern as the efforts to reproduce his likeness and sound must have been painstaking to acheive. More poignantly however (in light of her subsequent and untimely death) is the rendering of a young Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia I did feel a tear drop at that moment. This is a film fans can enjoy and is certainly an entertaining stop gap before the next installment in the sequel trilogy..., 3.5,  Adam T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976325309/, May 17 2017, N/A

 Film rating:<br>I rarely use 5 stars but this film earned it- especially after seeing it in true IMAX 2D which there are not many of in the United States. I have a a reason for each star I gave 1) Mixture of new and familiar characters / not overusing Lord Vader 2) Captured grittiness of Episode IV 3) Perfectly synced the ending to the beginning of Episode 4 4) Compelling storyline which didn't drift into unnecessary subplots and 5) Ending the way it did to treat the film as a truly part of anthology.<br><br>Previously rated trailer:<br>Seriously who doesn't want to see this after how good Star Wars VII was?

 This is my favorite Star Wars movie way better than the force awakens. The reason it isn't getting 5 stars is because they all died which was sad because the characters were very well developed and by the end of the movie you had more of a connection with them. They are all different and are there for different reasons. Cassian is loyal to the rebellion Jyn just wants to be with her father Chirrut and Baze just want to fight the empire Director Krennic wants the empire to trust him and make him more powerful.

 Is this movie perfect?....no but 2hrs 15 minutes goes by in a flash. Because Star Wars is such a successful franchise people want to pick it apart with a fine tooth comb. The real truth however is that this movie is one of if not the best movie of the entire year. It has everything it has drama it has action it has excitement it has new &amp intersting characters it has an interesting plot it has raw emotion and it makes you believe in human cliche's like hope &amp faith. This movie is darker and more grown up than the force awakens and that is not a bad thing.

 A fresh take on the Star Wars universe. The battle scenes look awesome and this actually feels like a war movie. 'Rogue One' focuses on characters outside of the main Jedi/Sith conflict making a much more interesting story as we are dealing with heavily flawed heroes instead of the more one-dimensional Jedi. While there could have been some more time spent on character development each of the main protagonists are unique additions to the Star Wars universe and the actors put a lot into making us care about them.

 This film exceeded all of my expectations considering that I pretty much knew the plot and outcome before it started. I liked it better than all of the previous star wars films. The reason is that it preserves and enhances that gritty realism of episodes 4-6 while taking out much of the force mythology which is not a strong suit of the series in my opinion. I am also a sucker for well done and realistic war movies and this more than makes the grade as such. The empire is finally portrayed as an effective and imposing military force as in the first act of Episode V rather than the usual Keystone Kops who can't hit the side of a barn with a blaster. The scene with Darth Vader at the end is particularly powerful and shocking due to the fact that force powers are not overused as they are in many of the other films. Killing off main characters also adds a refreshing sense of realism to these movies. Director Krennic is well developed/ acted and is believable as a result .There is just enough character development to draw you towards the protagonists yet the action moves swiftly as a thriller should in the last act. While controversial the use of CGI characters was seemless from my perspective. That said the close-up of the princess didn't quite work right. The sci-fi set eye candy and superb acting help make up for the slower character development scenes in the early part of the film. K-2SO is delightful as sardonic comic relief throughout. There are also plenty of easter eggs to keep genre fans happy. If you like a realistic and well done war movie immersion into a sci-fi universe solid acting and character development well placed sardonic humor an escalating fast pace to thriller status and a nice neat ending then I recommend you watch this film. I have watched it 4x so far., 5.0,  Gregory S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/941175005/, May 23 2017, N/A
 Rogue one is a mess and here's why: <br><br>-No character development. The characters are tropes (badass samurai heavy weapons guy wise old man etc.) without any sort of unique identity or distinction that would separate them from the trope. Even the robot is the damn "calculating emotionless robot who's funny because he doesn't understand social interaction" trope.<br><br>-No attempt is made to invigorate the plot. We all know how this film is going to end so why not spruce it up with some twists or interesting situations? Have someone betray the team and sell them out to the Empire. Have the team run into a trap. Anything would be better than the Planet A -&gt Planet B -&gt Planet C -&gt Planet D shit we were left with. It's linear as fuck and doesn't have any interesting deviations.<br><br>-Star Wars films have an unspoken rule of using three or so planets each movie. More can be in the film of course but it's best to primarily use three as this allows sufficient time for the audience to really immerse themselves in the atmosphere of each planet and learn a bit albeit subtly about its culture. A New Hope has Tatooine the Death Star and Yavin IV. Empire has Hoth Dagobah and Bespin. You see what I mean?<br><br>-Going off the last point this film has no atmosphere partially because it plays like any other blockbuster nowadays. I had a similar problem with The Force Awakens but that film at least adhered to the three planet rule. A lot of people forget that the original trilogy and prequel trilogy to an extent had slow meditative pacing. You'll hear people talking about why this doesn't feel like a Star Wars film. This is why. <br><br>-Villain is yet another turgid moustache-twirling villain in the Star Wars universe who doesn't really do much but pace about and complain about rebel scum. Why don't we ever get any real examples of him being evil? He's bad in the opening sequence yes but Jyn's mother is killed because she shot him first. Of course she's going to get shot back. <br><br>-It felt like there was some sort of diversity checklist when casting the rebels in this film. Sorry Weitz but you can't just write a bunch of minority characters in a film and expect them to be interesting just by the virtue of being minorities. You have to be a good writer which you are not. Not to get too tangential but Weitz's comments on Twitter about the Empire being a white supremacist organization are totally asinine if only because the Empire was originally comprised of a black man's clones and Finn was among their ranks and that comparison falls apart under the slightest of scrutiny. <br><br>-Wasn't there a big hullabaloo about AT-ATs being impervious to rebel fire in TESB or am I missing something? Are these just prototypes? <br><br>-CGI necromancy still can't avoid the uncanny valley. It would be better we didn't see as much of Tarkin's face or they just recast the role entirely.<br><br>-The Star Wars universe needs to adopt some sort of rubric for a consistent visual aesthetic otherwise these films are going to become really. Use similar equipment and lighting. Don't do the generic blockbuster thing of listing a location in subtitles when you could just be decent writers and mention it somewhere instead. Keep the panning from the original trilogy. I hate the MCU but this is something they do extremely well despite their lack of proper black values in color grading. <br><br>-The score is fucking horrible. I realize Giacchino only had 4 weeks to score this film but the score is abhorrent devoid of any discernable melodies or motifs which are part of the magic when you go see a blockbuster like Star Wars. It's integral to the identity of the film. Giacchino is a decent composer despite his inclination towards leaning on sad piano keys in Lydian mode but he could have done so much more here. Even rehashing of earlier themes would be acceptable honestly.<br><br>Some positives:<br><br>-Cinematography is mostly great. Shakycam doesn't seem to work in the Star Wars universe though but the Edwards' sense of scale in the final battle is unparalleled.<br><br>-The film ends pretty well compared to what came before it but the lack of character development hinders its attempts to be emotionally satisfying.<br><br>-The last planet is classic Star Wars shit. Great design atmosphere and brimming with imagination - just the sort of thing I want when I see a Star Wars film. <br><br>-Seeing Mustafar and Vader again was great. <br><br>Overall though the film is pretty flabby. It's another generic blockbuster set in the Star Wars universe. I'm tentatively excited for Episode IX if only because of Rian Johnson. Hopefully they'll be able to remember what the series is originally about., 2.0,  Michael B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/969990267/, May 22 2017, N/A
 This is a prequel to the original Star Wars trilogy - talks about the struggles of a group of rebels in acquiring the plans of the Death Star.

 Walt Disney's writers didn't even come close to creating a well done story. Lots and lots of special effects BUT...what's missing the great character development that George Lukas created such as the sarcastic Hans Solo.

 I enjoyed The Force Awakens but this one blew me away. Loved it. Fantastic movie. Beautiful. Only things I would change would be to make the octopus mind control alien in the beginning practical effects instead of CGI (I despise CGI and the alien looked good but not as good as practical would have) and having an alien protagonist. The small alien kicked ass but it would have been nice to see him or another alien have more of a protagonist role. It all feels too anthropocentric. Great characters though and the android steals a lot of scenes so there´s that. The fact that absolutely all of them die at the end that there are no Jedis focusing on the Rebel Alliance being mostly non force-sensitive ordinary people was an incredibly smart move. Oh and Forest Whitaker´s Saw Guerrera is excellent love his character and his death is incredibly emotional., 4.5,  Raven D, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/900692727/, May 11 2017, N/A
 Rogue One for me was a bit of a let down. I was hoping for more from this film but I was left with this empty feeling as the credits rolled. From the start this movie is all over the place. You barely get to learn anything about the "main character" Jyn. There are so many things they just left out due to the huge time jump towards the beginning. They don't show you how Jyn got into prison or how she learned to fight so well. They just have some characters say things about those topics and expect us to believe it. It's just lazy screenwriting plain and simple. Honestly the only good part of this movie is during the last thirty minutes. Which is sad to say because the other Star Wars films were so great because of their story not just the action. This film is just boring for the first and second act. People were actually falling asleep in the theater. This film does have one redeeming quality and that is James Earl Jones. It was amazing to see him back as Darth Vader though he only had about five minutes of screen time it made watching this movie actually worth it. As a long time Star Wars fan I really wanted to like this movie but Rogue One just doesn't live up to the hype., 2.5,  Cameron B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976250604/, May 10 2017, N/A

 This the absolute best way to tell a Star Wars story. This was more well done using characters from Episode !V than the re-skinning of the same movie and calling Episode VII. I really think that this story out shined the special effects which were also incredible. My only small complaint is there wasn't enough time to detail more of the lives of these characters.

 This SW fan is happy. Rogue One is why. To just sit back in a dark theater and let a SW story with fresh ideas and a slew of new characters wash over me brought me such joy even the likes of The Force Awakens couldn't achieve. Particularly Donnie Yen Tudyk's K2SO and Mendelsohn as frustrated glory mongering Krennic...although there is that Darth Vader guy too. And he provides the greatest 28 seconds in any movie I've seen in the last 2 years. The CGI Tarkin and Leia will probably bug some people because they look kinda fake but hey it's all fake.

 This review contains spoilers.<br><br>Points where they're due<br>This film looks visually appealing. The same can be said about most of the audio. The CGI characters were also really well done and left me thinking "wow technology is ever progressing."<br><br>Now the flaws.<br>As both a Star Wars fan and an unbiased judge I believe this little traipse of a Star Wars story fails on a personal level. Allow me a moment's elaboration.<br><br>It may be the result of over-analyzation but even after two thorough watch-throughs with my attention undivided I still have no idea who our main characters are or what is going on around them. Felicity Jones is a bad actress. She cannot deliver her lines in a natural or appropriate fashion. The same comment can be delivered for every single character in this film with the exception of the robot sidekick who's sole purpose for existing in this film is for fan-based relatability to the previous Star Wars films. It should not take five hours of my undivided attention for me to learn the name of ONE character and that being said the names of every other character that isn't Darth Vader or Felicity Jones' character (Jynn?) are still completely gone from my memory. <br><br>For those who know the Star Wars story it isn't a shocker that the premise of the movie is the retrieval of ONE data file. This being said the entire film treats its audience as though they should know and understand everything that's happening beforehand which is unacceptable. An example of this is the opening of the movie where Felicity's father is taken in to work in an isolated imperial base on the blueprints and construction of the Death Star. The problem is that none of the details I provided above are explained to the audience apart from the fact that the recruiters are Imperial. The lack of detail would leave a person new to the story totally and utterly confused and frankly it left me confused on the first watch as well. Another example is the scene in which the pilot of the ship (whatever his name is) is meeting in an undefined crowded city with a nameless character about rebel plans. Except that nobody knows what in God's name is being talked about because not even the planets on which the movie take place are unique charming or even figuratively tangible in a FANTASY SERIES. Our pilot friend then kills the messenger. How am I supposed to relate to and like a protagonist that's portrayed to be relatable or pure as a protagonist if he ruins my perception of his innocence as a person during his first appearance?! <br><br>Another major problem which goes hand in hand with the forgettable story is the characters in the story. As previously stated all the characters are completely forgettable to say the least. At points in the film the camera would point to completely unfamiliar faces which made me feel like either I was missing something or that these characters had yet to be important but were soon to be introduced. Neither of these options proved the case. My second watch-through disproved the first and the latter option is proven false by the fact that none of them ever talk let alone do anything of relevance. So when the story came to the final battle and the audience is subjected to watch everyone they've met so far die I notice that the framing of the story is to suggest that their (the characters) deaths are supposed inspire sadness or sympathy from the audience. I don't know about the average audience member movie experience but if a character dies and all I can think to do is chuckle and whisper "got em'." In my seat then CLEARLY THE CHARACTERS ARE NOT DEVELOPED ENOUGH FOR ME TO CARE. Good lord it's like shooting plastic army men with a pellet gun None of them have any personality none of them show any sign that they exist on an emotional or intellectual level above cardboard and none of them including Felicity Jones owner of the world's most punchable face inspire ANY FORM of sympathy from me throughout the duration of the movie. The fact that I'm clearly supposed to care about somebody just because I'm told to defeats the purpose of relatability in a character though it's not like any single character contained any shred of relatability anyways.<br><br>The next issue is the fact that the story relies on nothing more than pure coincidence to progress the plot which not only shows a film writer's incompetence but also displays before the entire audience how little the cast and crew care about you the audience. For those who aren't sure what I'm referencing let me enlighten you. The only reason this story even happened was because the rebels just happened to stumble across Felicity. The only reason the grenade fight of Ripoff Tatooine had any relevance is because the characters just happened to be in that city on the day a grenade fight happened. The only reason that they find the guy they're looking for is because they just so happened to kill one guy randomly in a grenade fight that they just so happened to be present for and the only real reason the crew finds Felicity's father is because the asthma-suffering sand man just so happens to contain a message that was intended for Felicity with no real non coincidental way of reaching her and the only reason the story made it this far was a build-off of previously stated coincidences. There's is no reason that any of these events needed to happen. There is no reason that this film even needed making. The mere fact that this movie is so shakily strung together as a result of the writer's case of the screw-it's is beyond personally insulting.<br><br>My last issue with this film off of the top of my head is a simple plot screw-up. The reason that Felicity has to go to the Imperial base in the movie conclusion is because the base holds all of the Death Star plans and blueprints. This would be fine and dandy but the Death Star ends up nuking the planet because the rebels start winning. Why would the Death Star nuke a location with so much education and information that is common necessity to the empire? That's like burning down the Library of Alexandria. One might argue that maybe all of the data that got destroyed was backed up somewhere in imperialist archives. If this is the case however there would be no point in keeping physical copies in a database like that. Such physical copies could be an open window for rebels to get an advantage as proven by this movie. If the empire has all data backed up it also doesn't make sense for their physical copies (assuming their importance renders them valuable enough to be kept in tact) to be so heavily guarded. If the data's backed up a stolen file wouldn't conclude in data loss. I would think in this scenario the empire would be wiser to hide the physical files among many bases less heavily guarded so as not to raise suspicion.<br><br>Okay. That's all I have to say off the top of my head. If I were to rate this movie out of 10 I'd give it a 3 or less., 1.5,  McKenzie P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976212131/, May 7 2017, N/A

 Rogue One achieves the impossible. Retreading the sacred ground of one of the most oversaturated and over speculated properties star wars and managing to seem fresh alluring and invigorating! Although it seems tokenistic and rushed at times spending too much of its screen time with poorly timed nods and fan service. The characters and plot march along with purpose and genuine enjoyment for audiences. However the biggest miss of the movie was the development of an initially intriguing and appealing cast who were denigrated to minor footnotes in the overall bloated drama and fodder of the star wars mythos, 3.0,  Christopher K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/876876892/, May 7 2017, N/A

 Yes the ending was quite exciting but the first 2/3 was fairly boring. The charecters had nothing to them and the beggining of the movie was all over the place. I enjoyed the visuals but a epic ending and a couple of seconds with Darth Vader were not enough for me to forget this movie's weaknesses.

 Arguably the best Star Wars film ever made.<br><br>Scratch that. It IS the best SW film to date and that's no jab at The Force Awakens or the original trilogy films.

 Rogue One: A Star Wars Story Review<br> Is it a Star Wars movie? Is it a war movie? Is it a fun action / adventure romp? It's a jack of all trades but a master of none. Rogue One tells the story of how the rebel alliance acquires the schematics for the Death Star used in Episode IV. The film follows Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) as the main protagonist daughter of Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) a renowned empirical science officer vital to the construction of the Death Star. Gyn is rescued by the rebel alliance and forced into helping them find her father in order to learn more of the Empire's rumored planet killer. Alongside Jyn are Captian Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) K-2SO (Alan Tudyk) Chirrut Imwe (Donnie Yen) Baze Malbus (Jiang Wen) and Bodhi Rook (Riz Ahmed). <br> To start off I must say the film is stunning to look at. The cinematography does a consistently wonderful job showcasing the many vast and varied landscapes. The wide range of different environments keeps the look fresh and adds a wider view of the warfront that we didn't get in the original trilogy. The action scenes are also top notch with some suitingly brutal moments fit for a war film. The special effects work done by ILM is also fantastic as usual and everything you see looks like it has been through war and battle. The film does a great job showcasing classic designs to the modern day audience. The film's acting is also solid with Alan Tudyk's K-2SO being the standout performance. Felicity Jones does a fine job but I felt that she wasn't given enough to work with outside a select few scenes where she takes front and center. Forest Whitaker takes the prize for strangest performance as Saw Gerrera. I found his voice to be strained and off putting a complaint that I am sure will be fairly common. <br> The largest problem with the movie is the lack of character development. We are hastily introduced to a merry band of misfits that make up the crew of Rogue One but outside of Jyn we are barely given any background information at all about the other members of the crew. Cassian has a scene on the ship where he gives us an inkling of background but outside of that we are left with next to nothing. Because of the lack of background and overall development of the characters I didn't feel myself become emotionally invested. Donnie Yen's character was the most intriguing to me (how can a person not be intrigued by a badass blind man obsessed with the Force?) but other than a small snippet of information we are not given insight into his past or his friendship with Baze. The most prominent evidence I have to support my claim of not caring about the characters is the fact that I couldn't remember the majority of their names when I started writing this. Make no mistake the crew of Rogue One are not going to hold your interest like the Guardians of the Galaxy for instance. <br> Rogue One moves along at what I felt to be a very consistent brisk pace. It rarely paused to give the characters time to breath. This wouldn't have been a problem if the characters were being fleshed out on the fly but they weren't and were not given the chance to because of the brisk pace. The heroes go from one beautiful location to the next falling into the wonderful action scenes I mentioned earlier. Despite how great they are (especially the third act) I didn't quite feel there were enough. The trailers gave the impression of this being a war film but I am of the opinion that there was not enough action or tension to give it that feel. I walked out of the theater thinking the movie got stuck between a fun romp and a more serious war movie and is lesser for it. <br> The villain of the movie Director Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) is an intriguing figure that I feel suffers from the same lack of depth as the protagonists. I have a good sense of the character from the Star Wars: Catalyst book that serves as a prequel to Rogue One and I feel that his character in the movie barely scratched the surface of who he is. A CGI character is present in the movie which I will not spoil but he provides a more intriguing menacing presence than Krennic which to me undermined his position as the main antagonist. Darth Vader is used in the film very sparingly but he is absolutely glorious to behold. There is a scene in Rogue One involving Darth Vader that brought chills to my spine and tears to my eyes and that is all I will say. <br> Outside of the lack of character development for both the protagonists and antagonists my largest complaint of the movie is the musical score. John Williams' presence is sorely missed here and the familiar Star Wars themes we know and love are also largely missing. At no point did I feel the music impacted how I felt about a particular scene like it did in other Star Wars films. <br> Overall I think Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is a fun blockbuster with intriguing yet underdeveloped characters. The way it ties in with Episode IV is perfectly done the third act of the movie is utterly fantastic and the film is a feast for the eyes. It is a good movie but it's flaws keep it from reaching greatness. <br><br>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story 7/10, 3.5,  Austin A, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/913653443/, May 4 2017, N/A

 When Rouge One: A Star Wars Story came out people were excited to see the installment that filled in the gap between episodes 3 and 4 and it lived up to that excitement. It didn't disappoint. It stars Felicity Jones Diego Luna and Mads Mikkelsen. This is the movie of the mission to steal the plans to the Death Star. It is the best Star Wars prequel to come out by-far. The flow of the story follows a more realistic tone to the series. It also brought in a new cast and new characters. The ones that weren't the main protagonists were kind of forgettable but the main ones were somewhat compelling. It is a very small complaint. It also had pretty good CGI. I can easily see why someone would dislike Rouge One. It could be for a lack of nostalgia. It could be because of slim character-development. I thought that the characters a decent amount of development. I also thought that it was packed with nostalgia especially during the third act.<br>I loved it.<br>Over all Rouge One: A Star Wars Story was a prequel that we actually cared about. 4/5 stars, 4.0,  Colby H, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976266481/, April 21 2017, N/A

 Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is a great Star Wars prequel to the Star Wars films. The story is really great the acting is good the cast was REALLY good and the film is actually better than The Force Awakens (in my opinion).

 THIS IS IT! FINALLY! AFTER THE GOD AWFUL STAR WARS PREQUELS THEY FINALLY GOT IT RIGHT!! Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is not only the best prequel of the franchise but the best film of 2016. Rogue One fills in the gap between Revenge of the SIth (2005) and A New Hope (1977) and follows Jyn Erso who gets picked up by a group of rebels that need her help with a risky plan to steal the plans for the death star. What makes Rogue One great is that unlike The Force Awakens we have some more familiar faces in terms of actors for example the film has Felicity Jones (Jyn Erso) Diego Luna (Captain Cassain Andor). Alan Tudyk (K-2SO) Forrest Whitaker (Saw Gerrera) and Riz Ahmed (Bodhi Rook) and they honestly all do so well with the parts they play. Felicity Jones and Forrest Whitaker are two actors that are really famous for their drama films so seeing them out of their comfort zones was great. Riz Ahmed's performance as Bodhi Rook was very good as well and completely made up for his performance in Jason Bourne (2016) which was only alright. What was also really great about Rogue One is that like The Force Awakens we have another memorable droid and Alan Tudyk who in my opinion is an underrated actor does a great job with the character and it was also great to see Tudyk back acting do to the fact that he was so good in the short lived series classic Firefly (2003). The best part about Rogue One was the action sequences the films action sequence are played out beautifully the action sequences in this film are on par with the action sequences in Force Awakens. Though Rogue One is a near perfect movie it definitely had its flaws for instance though the characters in this film were great i felt that the old characters and the charactersin The Force Awakens were just a little better but that was the only problem i had with the movie. I personally thought that The Force Awakens was a better film than Rogue One even though The Force Awakens followed similar elements to A New Hope but thats just me. Rogue One had a lot to live up to and it honestly lived up to all of my expectations Garreth Edwards finally made the prequel that Star Wars fans deserve. Theres no denying that all the Star Wars buffs are going to love Rogue One but I highly recommend this film to anyone even if you aren't a fan of the franchise and just want an action movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish I highly recommend Rogue One: A Star Wars Story for you I am positive you won't be disappointed., 4.5,  Jake M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/915806894/, April 30 2017, N/A

 The film never developed into that magic spark we expect to see from a Star Wars film. The characters were dull and unmemorable and with the exception to Donnie Yen no one captured any intrigue. The story was forced and lacked adventure. The final battle scene was good not great but good enough to save this film from being a complete flop. I suppose it was a nice idea to make a film showing how the rebels stole the Death Star blueprints thus providing some background and context for Episode IV but it felt as if Disney forced out a film knowing that the Star Wars franchise has a huge fan base and would turn a big profit., 3.5,  Muhammad L, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/975997795/, April 17 2017, N/A

 This is like the little Star Wars movie that tried. While it does have a bit of the star wars feel it falls short on so much that is Star Wars. Jyn is the only character they take the time to flesh out. And while I am all for diversity in all things many of the others accents were so distracting that it made it seem like poor performances. Cassian Imwe and Baze were all useless characters and could have been filled with more droids for the same effect. The star destroyers looked very plastic. The best part of this movie was Vader cutting loose. But even then having 2 separate actors play him was noticeable. In the original Star Wars film A New Hope Tarkin came to Vaders shoulder. And yet in this they make the video game graphic Tarkin very tall. He was taller than Krennic and yet Krennic was tall to the first Vader in the film. Over all this film had so many flaws that it's hard not to notice them. It's like watching the Ewoks Battle for Endor but with a movie studio budget. I could keep listing flaws but that would make this already long review unreadable. I gave this movie 2 stars because I have seen worse films. And this is about on par with the story and quality of The Phantom Menace., 2.0,  Jamie E, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/861824880/, April 15 2017, N/A
 great movie!!! worth the watch, 5.0,  Garrett C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/925572011/, April 15 2017, N/A
 Joined up just to review this movie. <br>How awful is this movie!! This script wouldn't have worked on the 60's tv show. The acting is worst. Felicity Jones OMG she looks like was tasered just before all of her lines. The rebels now are like bad as the Empire or whoever the bad guys are. Diego is like yeah I don't mind killing good guys I'm a captain. And all his lines with Felicity are like ' hey did you just get tasered?...'.<br>Boring bad movie ., 0.5,  BadFrad A, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/963234893/, April 15 2017, N/A
 Pretty meh.... much explosions and storm troopers still can't aim for **** mode of the same blandness from the series, 0.5,  Alex D, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976268252/, April 15 2017, N/A
 A masterful work of Star Wars art! This is the defining chapter thus far in modern Star Wars. Rogue One gleams with the charm tension and pathos that made the first two films such treats!, 5.0,  Liam M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/860413709/, April 15 2017, N/A
 Come on Disney you did it again! Killing all fathers and mothers leaving kids alone... It is not a movie for the die hard fans it is a semi story embedded in the original story of Star Wars where there is no connection with the true sequel the characters come out of nowhere ... how can you make a Star Wars movie  with no JEDI without R2D2 without Han Solo without Chewie without C3PO without Luke ...? Thankfully I did not see her in the theater very disappointed very disappointed. (Not everything is bad if you want to see a Vincent Price and a Princess Leia with a very digital face...), 0.5,  Jimmy N, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/813858314/, April 15 2017, N/A
 Makes me want to watch Star Wars 3 now, 5.0,  Diane W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/975430290/, April 15 2017, N/A
 Rogue One takes more risks than other recent Star Wars films making it the best Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back., 4.0,  Gabriel C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/975489962/, April 15 2017, N/A
 A technically well-done movie. It has action humour really impressive CGI it has everything you could want from a movie. But as a non star wars fan this movie offers little in the way of original narrative leaving me feel slightly unimpressed by this movie., 2.5, , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/780849123/, April 15 2017, Super-reviewer
 While none of the characters are that memorable and the mistake of not making Darth Vador the main villain is pretty big it is well acted. The story and effects is what makes the movie good and feels very much like the original trilogy which is good., 3.0,  Jason C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/915936926/, April 15 2017, N/A
 Remember when i said that Kubo And The Two Strings was the best movie of 2016?<br>Well that was clearly a long time ago!, 5.0,  Ziv E, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976032452/, April 15 2017, N/A
 Not as great as most Star Wars films but it was nice to get some backstory of the events between the other movies., 4.0,  Jon P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/940402529/, April 14 2017, N/A
 A good standard fare Star Wars movie. Somewhat formulaic but some nice visuals and the tie ins to the original movie (episode 4) were nice., 4.0,  Andre M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/787567681/, April 14 2017, N/A
 Star Wars is brought back to its former glory. If you love the rebel alliance then prepare to love it even more., 5.0,  Michael Y, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/963705152/, April 14 2017, N/A
 I saw Rogue One it at the midnight showing and I was super excited. I thought that this could be something new something we haven't seen before. And while I did enjoy it very very much I left the theater feeling empty handed. I got big explosions dying Stormtroopers AT-AT's and nothing else. It was just a whole movie full of "WOW STAR WARS STUFF"! There are no characters that you like no acting that is convincing and no pacing that doesn't make you check your watch. You can't root for anybody because they have no motivation for anything. Not after the first thirty minutes at least. Felicity Jones is boring Diego Luna is terrible Riz Ahmed and almost everyone else except for Donnie Yen is just awkward. The movie has some great scenes involving comedy but they rely on it too much to the point where it becomes inappropriate. It also relied too much on the previous Star Wars films to make it passable. The things Rogue One gets right though are the visuals. My God this movie looks fantastic. Everything I was looking at felt and looked real. And the action is great too. It is by far the best action we've seen in a Star Wars film to date. The third act is where the movie gets really great. If they had tried to do what they did for the third act with the first two the movie would be up there with Empire. But in the end despite having some very big character development flaws Rogue One was a very good movie and I'm giving it a 7.5/10., 3.5,  Jeje W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/975762931/, April 14 2017, N/A
 Would have been better had someone not spoiled it., 3.0,  Kay L, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/203174761/, April 14 2017, N/A
 I didn't care for this film. I didn't feel attached or invented in any of the characters the story wasn't anything special no actors worth mentioning everything was just so mediocre. Comparing it to the original Star Wars films it wasn't good and wasn't needed., ,  Jordan B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976255483/, April 14 2017, N/A
 Really good. Just like IV, wts,  Mats O, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976264087/, April 14 2017, N/A
