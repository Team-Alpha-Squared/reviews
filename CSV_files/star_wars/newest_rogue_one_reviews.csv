 The best Star Wars movie from a visual perspective. The story is good because it's gritty and actually tries to build credit with the audience. The biggest effect the movie has on the Star Wars universe is that it shows what the new trilogy (episodes 8 and 9) could have been instead of the mindless mess that they new trilogy has become. Apparently Disney can make a half-way decent Star Wars movie when they really want to. What a shame they've blown it with Episode 8 and particularly the disaster that was Episode 9., 4.0,  Mark S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977000071/, March 20 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a good spinoff. Originality is there acting is there and the visuals are there. The story itself though is kind of........ not. While the characters are very well put together and character development is solid the story is empty and somewhat confusing at times.

 Despite being very fond of the original Star Wars trilogy I've always been more of a Star Trek fan than Star Wars and the recent Star Wars movies have only served to reinforce my preference and left me uninterested This movie however gets 10/10 and were all the Star Wars movies as good as this would certainly change the balance of the preference force., 5.0,  James C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/937277817/, March 17 2018, N/A
 This movie had many flaws with pacing and it felt very slow at times and dragging on all of the scenes seemed cut together in no manner that felt like it benefited the story. The characters are not all too likable except brief character building moments that are cut short for a action sequence. All of the interesting story beats are not monopolized on and it seems that they focused too much on making a movie that gave you information and not a story. This entire movie is based on a single throw away line from a character in another Star Wars movie and it shows. The writing has many good moments and other terrible ones I enjoyed all of the acting especially that of Diego Luno who was a very good part of the movie unfortunately none of the characters sold the team aspect of the movie and only seemed like a bunch of stranger who ran into each other this theme was still present at the end of the film. I thought this was an okay film but the potential was wasted with many of the scenes there are many amazing moments but overall the film lacks a good story and character development in my opinion. This is still a very watchable film and you will find out very interesting things about the Star Wars universe you didn't know and some of them seem as if you didn't even ask but are given the answer anyway. You can tell the creators are real Star Wars fans though and it is very well made the visuals are stunning but it seems at times whole sequences were cut short and that parts of the movie just went missing on the cutting room floor which is very unfortunate for a promising film like this. You should still watch this film if you enjoy Star Wars movies though but I might say it's not for the average viewer but you might like it if you're into sci-fi., 2.5,  Josh K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/931853787/, March 16 2018, N/A
 This movie is somewhat difficult to get invested in for a while as the characters are hard to identify and aren't particularly fleshed out by the climax makes up for all of this.

 Very underwhelming knowing that it's a Star Wars film but is fun at time. K2SO is so much fun and Chirrut Imwe is a badass. The villain Krennec was very bland but the troopers were well designed and well utilized. Jones was okay as Jyn Erso but wasn't as heroic as I predicted. Besides some fun action scenes Rogue One was a major disappointment and leaves me pessimistic looking at the future of the Star Wars side stories., 3.0,  A.J.

 Enjoyable genre movie-making that answers the question "How did the rebels get the Death Star plans?" and thus serves as a prelude to Episode 4: A New Hope which most of us know to be just Star Wars (1977). Indeed we are treated to cameos by Princess Leia (young Carrie Fisher digitally) C3PO &amp R2D2 (briefly) and Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) as well as some guy in Peter Cushing make-up. (Jimmy Smits is here but I don't know why since I gave Episodes 2 and 3 a miss). The real focus here is on new characters however. It seems Mads Mikkelsen's Galen Erso designed the Death Star for the Empire under pressure even after they killed his wife and sent his daughter into hiding (with Forest Whitaker of the Rebels). As revenge he put "the flaw" into the machinery that the plans reveal. Years later his daughter Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) becomes convinced to get those Death Star plans along with Diego Luna Donnie Yen Wen Jiang Riz Ahmed and a deadpan robot named K-2SO. Aussie Ben Mendelsohn is the chief baddie (apart from D. V.). It's all action from start to finish with the typical Star Wars blend of smart-ass dialogue bonding and sentimentality and good vs. evil shoot-em-ups. There are attempts to create distinct characters but they are not much more than pieces on the chess board here totemic though some may be. In the end the film looks good (CGI) and director Gareth Edwards keeps things moving at a good pace (however like many films today it is probably a bit too long). Conclusion: if you like the franchise this is well worth your time., 3.5,  Art S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/792064900/, March 15 2018, N/A

 "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" was an exciting sci-fi film that added well to the saga particularly to the original Star Wars film. The well-blended action originality and nostalgia made this film fun to watch from beginning to end. The performances by the characters were solid. Ben Mendelsohn's portrayal of Orson Krennic was my favorite performance of the film. He was a very believable intense villain with a decent amount of depth. However despite how much I enjoyed this film it definitely wasn't perfect.<br><br>My first issue with the film was the music. This had nothing to do with the fact that there was no opening crawl I actually appreciated that. I just thought that the music was sub-par in comparison to the rest of the saga. Now I don't think that the music was totally deplorable it just seemed like amateur work at certain points (i.e. the beginning). I also had a hard time investing in the majority of the characters. My least favorite character was Saw Guerrera. I couldn't stand his voice and really couldn't take hime seriously at all. In fact I disliked the majority of the first act with the exception of the very beginning and all the action which was great and explained Jyn's origins. My least favorite part was the giant-octopus scene. That was just weird and made Saw look like a complete joke.<br><br>Thankfully this movie really picked up in the second and 3rd act and totally saved it for me. Despite the iffy CGI I loved Tarkin's role in the film and Vader's scenes we're awesome. The final space battles we're a blast and looked very real with the blend of CGI/practical effects. The drama of the film also picked up in the third act which actually had me invested in the characters unlike the first act.<br><br>Overall "Rogue One" was a great film that really added to the original Star Wars narrative. When I left the theater the first thing I wanted to do was watch the original Star Wars film which for me meant that this new film was a job well done!, 3.5,  Jacob W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/968029823/, March 13 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a solid action packed star wars movie worthy of its place in the Star wars universe with a great collection of rag tag crew led by Felicity Jones this movie pulls us. A motley crew up against a monumental task it is reminiscent of "The Bridge on the River Kwai" impossible mission movies. It also solves one of the longest problems in the star wars story the vulnerability of the death star it fills in a gap with a great deal of wonderful movie magic. its climatic end is as sad as it is satisfying and the ending scenes as well as a few others that add the character of darth vader teases the heck out of the question will we see more of Darth Vader in the future? There some bad CGI Tarken but CGI is used to great effect in the battle scenes. Rogue One shows that the Star Wars universe is growing up the message of this movie is sometimes heros die in a good cause Its a grown up message for a grown up Star Wars., 3.5,  Oliver G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976979342/, March 10 2018, N/A

 Rogue One é realizado por Garth Edwards e tem lugar entre o episódio III (2005) e IV (1974) da saga Star Wars (1974 -). O maior elogio que posso fazer a este filme é que me fez apreciar ainda mais o episódio IV da série e o mundo de Star Wars em geral.<br><br>Devo dizer que este é um filme dedicado aos fãs da saga mas que deve também agradar a quem não acompanha fielmente a sua história. Contudo de forma a apreciar na totalidade esta experiência recomendo que tenham algum conhecimento dos restantes filmes ou até da banda desenhada.<br><br>No episódio IV sabemos que a Aliança Rebelde tem posse dos planos da Estrela da Morte assim como o conhecimento de uma pequena falha no seu projeto mas nunca soubemos como até então.<br><br>Em The Force Awakens (2015) Daisy Ridley esteve brilhante enquanto Rey agora Felicity Jones que interpreta Jyn Erso vem demonstrar que também ela é uma grande adição às estrelas femininas deste universo assim como ao elenco em geral. Ao longo do filme Jyn é uma das poucas personagens que tem de facto uma progressão individual. Sim não existe uma intenção em aprofundar as personagens neste filme e às vezes torna-se necessário para conseguirmos estabelecer um sentimento de pertença das mesmas na história ainda assim deixei-me comover em certos momentos.<br><br>Não há como não me comover quando a banda sonora de Michael Giacchino atinge o seu auge com apenas quatro semanas para a compor. A música em Star Wars é sentida como se de uma personagem se tratasse e embora neste filme não existam muitas faixas de destaque a composição é eficiente. Dê-lhe mais tempo e certamente que em futuros projetos o som será mais refinado.<br><br>O antagonista Director Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) é um vilão com uma progressão interessante ficando progressivamente mais enfurecido. Tem uma missão para concretizar e quer ficar com os merecidos créditos é um patife agradável de assistir. Também Donnie Yen que interpreta Chirrut Îmwe um ex-guardião de um templo dos Jedi que está bastante ligado à Força apresenta-se como uma personagem de relevo não só ao filme como à mitologia de Star Wars em geral. É uma personagem única num universo surpreendente.<br><br>K-2SO o novo robô foi uma presença necessária neste filme de guerra. Tudo desde os cenários às expressões e falas das personagens indicavam um clima de tensão e irritabilidade. Até mesmo a Aliança Rebelde por vezes tinha de cometer atos que não os deixavam muito orgulhosos. Este robô não só ajudou a harmonizar o ambiente com o seu sentido de humor sarcástico como também a monotonia que por vezes se sentia. Não de uma forma penosa ou nada que se parecesse mas à medida que o filme progredia mais sentíamos o que podíamos esperar dele.<br><br>O terceiro ato foi um dos melhores que a saga oferece. Principalmente os últimos trinta minutos que foram uma (muitas!) explosão de ação com a narrativa dividida em três pontos principais. Todas as cenas prenderam ao ecrã e fizeram-me estar investido no filme. No final há uma sequência em particular que certamente irá entrar no pódio dos melhores momentos de toda a saga. É um final digno e apropriado para um dos meus filmes preferidos de Star Wars.<br><br>8/10, 4.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976856229/, March 10 2018, N/A

 This movie had many flaws with pacing and it felt very slow at times and dragging on all of the scenes seemed cut together in no manner that felt like it benefited the story. The characters are not all too likable except brief character building moments that are cut short for a action sequence. All of the interesting story beats are not monopolized on and it seems that they focused too much on making a movie that gave you information and not a story. This entire movie is based on a single throw away line from a character in another Star Wars movie and it shows. The writing has many good moments and other terrible ones I enjoyed all of the acting especially that of Diego Luno who was a very good part of the movie unfortunately none of the characters sold the team aspect of the movie and only seemed like a bunch of stranger who ran into each other this theme was still present at the end of the film. I thought this was an okay film but the potential was wasted with many of the scenes there are many amazing moments but overall the film lacks a good story and character development in my opinion. This is still a very watchable film and you will find out very interesting things about the Star Wars universe you didn't know and some of them seem as if you didn't even ask but are given the answer anyway. You can tell the creators are real Star Wars fans though and it is very well made the visuals are stunning but it seems at times whole sequences were cut short and that parts of the movie just went missing on the cutting room floor which is very unfortunate for a promising film like this. You should still watch this film if you enjoy Star Wars movies though but I might say it's not for the average viewer but you might like it if you're into sci-fi., 2.5,  Josh K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/931853787/, March 16 2018, N/A
 This movie is somewhat difficult to get invested in for a while as the characters are hard to identify and aren't particularly fleshed out by the climax makes up for all of this.

 Very underwhelming knowing that it's a Star Wars film but is fun at time. K2SO is so much fun and Chirrut Imwe is a badass. The villain Krennec was very bland but the troopers were well designed and well utilized. Jones was okay as Jyn Erso but wasn't as heroic as I predicted.

 Enjoyable genre movie-making that answers the question "How did the rebels get the Death Star plans?" and thus serves as a prelude to Episode 4: A New Hope which most of us know to be just Star Wars (1977). Indeed we are treated to cameos by Princess Leia (young Carrie Fisher digitally) C3PO &amp R2D2 (briefly) and Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) as well as some guy in Peter Cushing make-up. (Jimmy Smits is here but I don't know why since I gave Episodes 2 and 3 a miss). The real focus here is on new characters however. It seems Mads Mikkelsen's Galen Erso designed the Death Star for the Empire under pressure even after they killed his wife and sent his daughter into hiding (with Forest Whitaker of the Rebels). As revenge he put "the flaw" into the machinery that the plans reveal. Years later his daughter Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) becomes convinced to get those Death Star plans along with Diego Luna Donnie Yen Wen Jiang Riz Ahmed and a deadpan robot named K-2SO. Aussie Ben Mendelsohn is the chief baddie (apart from D. V.). It's all action from start to finish with the typical Star Wars blend of smart-ass dialogue bonding and sentimentality and good vs. evil shoot-em-ups. There are attempts to create distinct characters but they are not much more than pieces on the chess board here totemic though some may be. In the end the film looks good (CGI) and director Gareth Edwards keeps things moving at a good pace (however like many films today it is probably a bit too long). Conclusion: if you like the franchise this is well worth your time., 3.5,  Art S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/792064900/, March 15 2018, N/A

 "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" was an exciting sci-fi film that added well to the saga particularly to the original Star Wars film. The well-blended action originality and nostalgia made this film fun to watch from beginning to end. The performances by the characters were solid. Ben Mendelsohn's portrayal of Orson Krennic was my favorite performance of the film. He was a very believable intense villain with a decent amount of depth. However despite how much I enjoyed this film it definitely wasn't perfect.<br><br>My first issue with the film was the music. This had nothing to do with the fact that there was no opening crawl I actually appreciated that. I just thought that the music was sub-par in comparison to the rest of the saga. Now I don't think that the music was totally deplorable it just seemed like amateur work at certain points (i.e. the beginning). I also had a hard time investing in the majority of the characters. My least favorite character was Saw Guerrera. I couldn't stand his voice and really couldn't take hime seriously at all. In fact I disliked the majority of the first act with the exception of the very beginning and all the action which was great and explained Jyn's origins. My least favorite part was the giant-octopus scene. That was just weird and made Saw look like a complete joke.<br><br>Thankfully this movie really picked up in the second and 3rd act and totally saved it for me. Despite the iffy CGI I loved Tarkin's role in the film and Vader's scenes we're awesome. The final space battles we're a blast and looked very real with the blend of CGI/practical effects. The drama of the film also picked up in the third act which actually had me invested in the characters unlike the first act.<br><br>Overall "Rogue One" was a great film that really added to the original Star Wars narrative. When I left the theater the first thing I wanted to do was watch the original Star Wars film which for me meant that this new film was a job well done!, 3.5,  Jacob W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/968029823/, March 13 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a solid action packed star wars movie worthy of its place in the Star wars universe with a great collection of rag tag crew led by Felicity Jones this movie pulls us. A motley crew up against a monumental task it is reminiscent of "The Bridge on the River Kwai" impossible mission movies. It also solves one of the longest problems in the star wars story the vulnerability of the death star it fills in a gap with a great deal of wonderful movie magic. its climatic end is as sad as it is satisfying and the ending scenes as well as a few others that add the character of darth vader teases the heck out of the question will we see more of Darth Vader in the future? There some bad CGI Tarken but CGI is used to great effect in the battle scenes. Rogue One shows that the Star Wars universe is growing up the message of this movie is sometimes heros die in a good cause Its a grown up message for a grown up Star Wars., 3.5,  Oliver G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976979342/, March 10 2018, N/A

 Rogue One é realizado por Garth Edwards e tem lugar entre o episódio III (2005) e IV (1974) da saga Star Wars (1974 -). O maior elogio que posso fazer a este filme é que me fez apreciar ainda mais o episódio IV da série e o mundo de Star Wars em geral.<br><br>Devo dizer que este é um filme dedicado aos fãs da saga mas que deve também agradar a quem não acompanha fielmente a sua história. Contudo de forma a apreciar na totalidade esta experiência recomendo que tenham algum conhecimento dos restantes filmes ou até da banda desenhada.<br><br>No episódio IV sabemos que a Aliança Rebelde tem posse dos planos da Estrela da Morte assim como o conhecimento de uma pequena falha no seu projeto mas nunca soubemos como até então.<br><br>Em The Force Awakens (2015) Daisy Ridley esteve brilhante enquanto Rey agora Felicity Jones que interpreta Jyn Erso vem demonstrar que também ela é uma grande adição às estrelas femininas deste universo assim como ao elenco em geral. Ao longo do filme Jyn é uma das poucas personagens que tem de facto uma progressão individual. Sim não existe uma intenção em aprofundar as personagens neste filme e às vezes torna-se necessário para conseguirmos estabelecer um sentimento de pertença das mesmas na história ainda assim deixei-me comover em certos momentos.<br><br>Não há como não me comover quando a banda sonora de Michael Giacchino atinge o seu auge com apenas quatro semanas para a compor. A música em Star Wars é sentida como se de uma personagem se tratasse e embora neste filme não existam muitas faixas de destaque a composição é eficiente. Dê-lhe mais tempo e certamente que em futuros projetos o som será mais refinado.<br><br>O antagonista Director Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) é um vilão com uma progressão interessante ficando progressivamente mais enfurecido. Tem uma missão para concretizar e quer ficar com os merecidos créditos é um patife agradável de assistir. Também Donnie Yen que interpreta Chirrut Îmwe um ex-guardião de um templo dos Jedi que está bastante ligado à Força apresenta-se como uma personagem de relevo não só ao filme como à mitologia de Star Wars em geral. É uma personagem única num universo surpreendente.<br><br>K-2SO o novo robô foi uma presença necessária neste filme de guerra. Tudo desde os cenários às expressões e falas das personagens indicavam um clima de tensão e irritabilidade. Até mesmo a Aliança Rebelde por vezes tinha de cometer atos que não os deixavam muito orgulhosos. Este robô não só ajudou a harmonizar o ambiente com o seu sentido de humor sarcástico como também a monotonia que por vezes se sentia. Não de uma forma penosa ou nada que se parecesse mas à medida que o filme progredia mais sentíamos o que podíamos esperar dele.<br><br>O terceiro ato foi um dos melhores que a saga oferece. Principalmente os últimos trinta minutos que foram uma (muitas!) explosão de ação com a narrativa dividida em três pontos principais. Todas as cenas prenderam ao ecrã e fizeram-me estar investido no filme. No final há uma sequência em particular que certamente irá entrar no pódio dos melhores momentos de toda a saga. É um final digno e apropriado para um dos meus filmes preferidos de Star Wars.<br><br>8/10, 4.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976856229/, March 10 2018, N/A
 The best Star Wars movie from a visual perspective. The story is good because it's gritty and actually tries to build credit with the audience. The biggest effect the movie has on the Star Wars universe is that it shows what the new trilogy (episodes 8 and 9) could have been instead of the mindless mess that they new trilogy has become. Apparently Disney can make a half-way decent Star Wars movie when they really want to. What a shame they've blown it with Episode 8 and particularly the disaster that was Episode 9., 4.0,  Mark S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977000071/, March 20 2018, N/A

I thought this was an okay film but the potential was wasted with many of the scenes there are many amazing moments but overall the film lacks a good story and character development in my opinion. This is still a very watchable film and you will find out very interesting things about the Star Wars universe you didn't know and some of them seem as if you didn't even ask but are given the answer anyway. You can tell the creators are real Star Wars fans though and it is very well made the visuals are stunning but it seems at times whole sequences were cut short and that parts of the movie just went missing on the cutting room floor which is very unfortunate for a promising film like this. You should still watch this film if you enjoy Star Wars movies though but I might say it's not for the average viewer but you might like it if you're into sci-fi., 2.5,  Josh K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/931853787/, March 16 2018, N/A
 This movie is somewhat difficult to get invested in for a while as the characters are hard to identify and aren't particularly fleshed out by the climax makes up for all of this.

 Very underwhelming knowing that it's a Star Wars film but is fun at time. K2SO is so much fun and Chirrut Imwe is a badass. The villain Krennec was very bland but the troopers were well designed and well utilized. Jones was okay as Jyn Erso but wasn't as heroic as I predicted. Besides some fun action scenes Rogue One was a major disappointment and leaves me pessimistic looking at the future of the Star Wars side stories., 3.0,  A.J.

 Enjoyable genre movie-making that answers the question "How did the rebels get the Death Star plans?" and thus serves as a prelude to Episode 4: A New Hope which most of us know to be just Star Wars (1977). Indeed we are treated to cameos by Princess Leia (young Carrie Fisher digitally) C3PO &amp R2D2 (briefly) and Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) as well as some guy in Peter Cushing make-up. (Jimmy Smits is here but I don't know why since I gave Episodes 2 and 3 a miss). The real focus here is on new characters however. It seems Mads Mikkelsen's Galen Erso designed the Death Star for the Empire under pressure even after they killed his wife and sent his daughter into hiding (with Forest Whitaker of the Rebels). As revenge he put "the flaw" into the machinery that the plans reveal. Years later his daughter Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) becomes convinced to get those Death Star plans along with Diego Luna Donnie Yen Wen Jiang Riz Ahmed and a deadpan robot named K-2SO. Aussie Ben Mendelsohn is the chief baddie (apart from D. V.). It's all action from start to finish with the typical Star Wars blend of smart-ass dialogue bonding and sentimentality and good vs. evil shoot-em-ups. There are attempts to create distinct characters but they are not much more than pieces on the chess board here totemic though some may be. In the end the film looks good (CGI) and director Gareth Edwards keeps things moving at a good pace (however like many films today it is probably a bit too long). Conclusion: if you like the franchise this is well worth your time., 3.5,  Art S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/792064900/, March 15 2018, N/A

 "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" was an exciting sci-fi film that added well to the saga particularly to the original Star Wars film. The well-blended action originality and nostalgia made this film fun to watch from beginning to end. The performances by the characters were solid. Ben Mendelsohn's portrayal of Orson Krennic was my favorite performance of the film. He was a very believable intense villain with a decent amount of depth. However despite how much I enjoyed this film it definitely wasn't perfect.<br><br>My first issue with the film was the music. This had nothing to do with the fact that there was no opening crawl I actually appreciated that. I just thought that the music was sub-par in comparison to the rest of the saga. Now I don't think that the music was totally deplorable it just seemed like amateur work at certain points (i.e. the beginning). I also had a hard time investing in the majority of the characters. My least favorite character was Saw Guerrera. I couldn't stand his voice and really couldn't take hime seriously at all. In fact I disliked the majority of the first act with the exception of the very beginning and all the action which was great and explained Jyn's origins. My least favorite part was the giant-octopus scene. That was just weird and made Saw look like a complete joke.<br><br>Thankfully this movie really picked up in the second and 3rd act and totally saved it for me. Despite the iffy CGI I loved Tarkin's role in the film and Vader's scenes we're awesome. The final space battles we're a blast and looked very real with the blend of CGI/practical effects. The drama of the film also picked up in the third act which actually had me invested in the characters unlike the first act.<br><br>Overall "Rogue One" was a great film that really added to the original Star Wars narrative. When I left the theater the first thing I wanted to do was watch the original Star Wars film which for me meant that this new film was a job well done!, 3.5,  Jacob W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/968029823/, March 13 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a solid action packed star wars movie worthy of its place in the Star wars universe with a great collection of rag tag crew led by Felicity Jones this movie pulls us. A motley crew up against a monumental task it is reminiscent of "The Bridge on the River Kwai" impossible mission movies. It also solves one of the longest problems in the star wars story the vulnerability of the death star it fills in a gap with a great deal of wonderful movie magic. its climatic end is as sad as it is satisfying and the ending scenes as well as a few others that add the character of darth vader teases the heck out of the question will we see more of Darth Vader in the future? There some bad CGI Tarken but CGI is used to great effect in the battle scenes. Rogue One shows that the Star Wars universe is growing up the message of this movie is sometimes heros die in a good cause Its a grown up message for a grown up Star Wars., 3.5,  Oliver G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976979342/, March 10 2018, N/A

 Rogue One é realizado por Garth Edwards e tem lugar entre o episódio III (2005) e IV (1974) da saga Star Wars (1974 -). O maior elogio que posso fazer a este filme é que me fez apreciar ainda mais o episódio IV da série e o mundo de Star Wars em geral.<br><br>Devo dizer que este é um filme dedicado aos fãs da saga mas que deve também agradar a quem não acompanha fielmente a sua história. Contudo de forma a apreciar na totalidade esta experiência recomendo que tenham algum conhecimento dos restantes filmes ou até da banda desenhada.<br><br>No episódio IV sabemos que a Aliança Rebelde tem posse dos planos da Estrela da Morte assim como o conhecimento de uma pequena falha no seu projeto mas nunca soubemos como até então.<br><br>Em The Force Awakens (2015) Daisy Ridley esteve brilhante enquanto Rey agora Felicity Jones que interpreta Jyn Erso vem demonstrar que também ela é uma grande adição às estrelas femininas deste universo assim como ao elenco em geral. Ao longo do filme Jyn é uma das poucas personagens que tem de facto uma progressão individual. Sim não existe uma intenção em aprofundar as personagens neste filme e às vezes torna-se necessário para conseguirmos estabelecer um sentimento de pertença das mesmas na história ainda assim deixei-me comover em certos momentos.<br><br>Não há como não me comover quando a banda sonora de Michael Giacchino atinge o seu auge com apenas quatro semanas para a compor. A música em Star Wars é sentida como se de uma personagem se tratasse e embora neste filme não existam muitas faixas de destaque a composição é eficiente. Dê-lhe mais tempo e certamente que em futuros projetos o som será mais refinado.<br><br>O antagonista Director Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) é um vilão com uma progressão interessante ficando progressivamente mais enfurecido. Tem uma missão para concretizar e quer ficar com os merecidos créditos é um patife agradável de assistir. Também Donnie Yen que interpreta Chirrut Îmwe um ex-guardião de um templo dos Jedi que está bastante ligado à Força apresenta-se como uma personagem de relevo não só ao filme como à mitologia de Star Wars em geral. É uma personagem única num universo surpreendente.<br><br>K-2SO o novo robô foi uma presença necessária neste filme de guerra. Tudo desde os cenários às expressões e falas das personagens indicavam um clima de tensão e irritabilidade. Até mesmo a Aliança Rebelde por vezes tinha de cometer atos que não os deixavam muito orgulhosos. Este robô não só ajudou a harmonizar o ambiente com o seu sentido de humor sarcástico como também a monotonia que por vezes se sentia. Não de uma forma penosa ou nada que se parecesse mas à medida que o filme progredia mais sentíamos o que podíamos esperar dele.<br><br>O terceiro ato foi um dos melhores que a saga oferece. Principalmente os últimos trinta minutos que foram uma (muitas!) explosão de ação com a narrativa dividida em três pontos principais. Todas as cenas prenderam ao ecrã e fizeram-me estar investido no filme. No final há uma sequência em particular que certamente irá entrar no pódio dos melhores momentos de toda a saga. É um final digno e apropriado para um dos meus filmes preferidos de Star Wars.<br><br>8/10, 4.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976856229/, March 10 2018, N/A
 The best Star Wars movie from a visual perspective. The story is good because it's gritty and actually tries to build credit with the audience. The biggest effect the movie has on the Star Wars universe is that it shows what the new trilogy (episodes 8 and 9) could have been instead of the mindless mess that they new trilogy has become. Apparently Disney can make a half-way decent Star Wars movie when they really want to. What a shame they've blown it with Episode 8 and particularly the disaster that was Episode 9., 4.0,  Mark S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977000071/, March 20 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a good spinoff. Originality is there acting is there and the visuals are there. The story itself though is kind of........ not.

 This movie had many flaws with pacing and it felt very slow at times and dragging on all of the scenes seemed cut together in no manner that felt like it benefited the story. The characters are not all too likable except brief character building moments that are cut short for a action sequence. All of the interesting story beats are not monopolized on and it seems that they focused too much on making a movie that gave you information and not a story. This entire movie is based on a single throw away line from a character in another Star Wars movie and it shows. The writing has many good moments and other terrible ones I enjoyed all of the acting especially that of Diego Luno who was a very good part of the movie unfortunately none of the characters sold the team aspect of the movie and only seemed like a bunch of stranger who ran into each other this theme was still present at the end of the film.

 Very underwhelming knowing that it's a Star Wars film but is fun at time. K2SO is so much fun and Chirrut Imwe is a badass. The villain Krennec was very bland but the troopers were well designed and well utilized. Jones was okay as Jyn Erso but wasn't as heroic as I predicted. Besides some fun action scenes Rogue One was a major disappointment and leaves me pessimistic looking at the future of the Star Wars side stories., 3.0,  A.J.

 Enjoyable genre movie-making that answers the question "How did the rebels get the Death Star plans?" and thus serves as a prelude to Episode 4: A New Hope which most of us know to be just Star Wars (1977). Indeed we are treated to cameos by Princess Leia (young Carrie Fisher digitally) C3PO &amp R2D2 (briefly) and Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) as well as some guy in Peter Cushing make-up. (Jimmy Smits is here but I don't know why since I gave Episodes 2 and 3 a miss). The real focus here is on new characters however. It seems Mads Mikkelsen's Galen Erso designed the Death Star for the Empire under pressure even after they killed his wife and sent his daughter into hiding (with Forest Whitaker of the Rebels). As revenge he put "the flaw" into the machinery that the plans reveal. Years later his daughter Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) becomes convinced to get those Death Star plans along with Diego Luna Donnie Yen Wen Jiang Riz Ahmed and a deadpan robot named K-2SO. Aussie Ben Mendelsohn is the chief baddie (apart from D. V.). It's all action from start to finish with the typical Star Wars blend of smart-ass dialogue bonding and sentimentality and good vs. evil shoot-em-ups. There are attempts to create distinct characters but they are not much more than pieces on the chess board here totemic though some may be. In the end the film looks good (CGI) and director Gareth Edwards keeps things moving at a good pace (however like many films today it is probably a bit too long). Conclusion: if you like the franchise this is well worth your time., 3.5,  Art S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/792064900/, March 15 2018, N/A

 "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" was an exciting sci-fi film that added well to the saga particularly to the original Star Wars film. The well-blended action originality and nostalgia made this film fun to watch from beginning to end. The performances by the characters were solid. Ben Mendelsohn's portrayal of Orson Krennic was my favorite performance of the film. He was a very believable intense villain with a decent amount of depth. However despite how much I enjoyed this film it definitely wasn't perfect.<br><br>My first issue with the film was the music. This had nothing to do with the fact that there was no opening crawl I actually appreciated that. I just thought that the music was sub-par in comparison to the rest of the saga. Now I don't think that the music was totally deplorable it just seemed like amateur work at certain points (i.e. the beginning). I also had a hard time investing in the majority of the characters. My least favorite character was Saw Guerrera. I couldn't stand his voice and really couldn't take hime seriously at all. In fact I disliked the majority of the first act with the exception of the very beginning and all the action which was great and explained Jyn's origins. My least favorite part was the giant-octopus scene. That was just weird and made Saw look like a complete joke.<br><br>Thankfully this movie really picked up in the second and 3rd act and totally saved it for me. Despite the iffy CGI I loved Tarkin's role in the film and Vader's scenes we're awesome. The final space battles we're a blast and looked very real with the blend of CGI/practical effects. The drama of the film also picked up in the third act which actually had me invested in the characters unlike the first act.<br><br>Overall "Rogue One" was a great film that really added to the original Star Wars narrative. When I left the theater the first thing I wanted to do was watch the original Star Wars film which for me meant that this new film was a job well done!, 3.5,  Jacob W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/968029823/, March 13 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a solid action packed star wars movie worthy of its place in the Star wars universe with a great collection of rag tag crew led by Felicity Jones this movie pulls us. A motley crew up against a monumental task it is reminiscent of "The Bridge on the River Kwai" impossible mission movies. It also solves one of the longest problems in the star wars story the vulnerability of the death star it fills in a gap with a great deal of wonderful movie magic. its climatic end is as sad as it is satisfying and the ending scenes as well as a few others that add the character of darth vader teases the heck out of the question will we see more of Darth Vader in the future? There some bad CGI Tarken but CGI is used to great effect in the battle scenes. Rogue One shows that the Star Wars universe is growing up the message of this movie is sometimes heros die in a good cause Its a grown up message for a grown up Star Wars., 3.5,  Oliver G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976979342/, March 10 2018, N/A

 Rogue One é realizado por Garth Edwards e tem lugar entre o episódio III (2005) e IV (1974) da saga Star Wars (1974 -). O maior elogio que posso fazer a este filme é que me fez apreciar ainda mais o episódio IV da série e o mundo de Star Wars em geral.<br><br>Devo dizer que este é um filme dedicado aos fãs da saga mas que deve também agradar a quem não acompanha fielmente a sua história. Contudo de forma a apreciar na totalidade esta experiência recomendo que tenham algum conhecimento dos restantes filmes ou até da banda desenhada.<br><br>No episódio IV sabemos que a Aliança Rebelde tem posse dos planos da Estrela da Morte assim como o conhecimento de uma pequena falha no seu projeto mas nunca soubemos como até então.<br><br>Em The Force Awakens (2015) Daisy Ridley esteve brilhante enquanto Rey agora Felicity Jones que interpreta Jyn Erso vem demonstrar que também ela é uma grande adição às estrelas femininas deste universo assim como ao elenco em geral. Ao longo do filme Jyn é uma das poucas personagens que tem de facto uma progressão individual. Sim não existe uma intenção em aprofundar as personagens neste filme e às vezes torna-se necessário para conseguirmos estabelecer um sentimento de pertença das mesmas na história ainda assim deixei-me comover em certos momentos.<br><br>Não há como não me comover quando a banda sonora de Michael Giacchino atinge o seu auge com apenas quatro semanas para a compor. A música em Star Wars é sentida como se de uma personagem se tratasse e embora neste filme não existam muitas faixas de destaque a composição é eficiente. Dê-lhe mais tempo e certamente que em futuros projetos o som será mais refinado.<br><br>O antagonista Director Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) é um vilão com uma progressão interessante ficando progressivamente mais enfurecido. Tem uma missão para concretizar e quer ficar com os merecidos créditos é um patife agradável de assistir. Também Donnie Yen que interpreta Chirrut Îmwe um ex-guardião de um templo dos Jedi que está bastante ligado à Força apresenta-se como uma personagem de relevo não só ao filme como à mitologia de Star Wars em geral. É uma personagem única num universo surpreendente.<br><br>K-2SO o novo robô foi uma presença necessária neste filme de guerra. Tudo desde os cenários às expressões e falas das personagens indicavam um clima de tensão e irritabilidade. Até mesmo a Aliança Rebelde por vezes tinha de cometer atos que não os deixavam muito orgulhosos. Este robô não só ajudou a harmonizar o ambiente com o seu sentido de humor sarcástico como também a monotonia que por vezes se sentia. Não de uma forma penosa ou nada que se parecesse mas à medida que o filme progredia mais sentíamos o que podíamos esperar dele.<br><br>O terceiro ato foi um dos melhores que a saga oferece. Principalmente os últimos trinta minutos que foram uma (muitas!) explosão de ação com a narrativa dividida em três pontos principais. Todas as cenas prenderam ao ecrã e fizeram-me estar investido no filme. No final há uma sequência em particular que certamente irá entrar no pódio dos melhores momentos de toda a saga. É um final digno e apropriado para um dos meus filmes preferidos de Star Wars.<br><br>8/10, 4.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976856229/, March 10 2018, N/A
 The best Star Wars movie from a visual perspective. The story is good because it's gritty and actually tries to build credit with the audience. The biggest effect the movie has on the Star Wars universe is that it shows what the new trilogy (episodes 8 and 9) could have been instead of the mindless mess that they new trilogy has become. Apparently Disney can make a half-way decent Star Wars movie when they really want to. What a shame they've blown it with Episode 8 and particularly the disaster that was Episode 9., 4.0,  Mark S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977000071/, March 20 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a good spinoff. Originality is there acting is there and the visuals are there. The story itself though is kind of........ not.

 This movie had many flaws with pacing and it felt very slow at times and dragging on all of the scenes seemed cut together in no manner that felt like it benefited the story. The characters are not all too likable except brief character building moments that are cut short for a action sequence. All of the interesting story beats are not monopolized on and it seems that they focused too much on making a movie that gave you information and not a story. This entire movie is based on a single throw away line from a character in another Star Wars movie and it shows. The writing has many good moments and other terrible ones I enjoyed all of the acting especially that of Diego Luno who was a very good part of the movie unfortunately none of the characters sold the team aspect of the movie and only seemed like a bunch of stranger who ran into each other this theme was still present at the end of the film. I thought this was an okay film but the potential was wasted with many of the scenes there are many amazing moments but overall the film lacks a good story and character development in my opinion. This is still a very watchable film and you will find out very interesting things about the Star Wars universe you didn't know and some of them seem as if you didn't even ask but are given the answer anyway. You can tell the creators are real Star Wars fans though and it is very well made the visuals are stunning but it seems at times whole sequences were cut short and that parts of the movie just went missing on the cutting room floor which is very unfortunate for a promising film like this. You should still watch this film if you enjoy Star Wars movies though but I might say it's not for the average viewer but you might like it if you're into sci-fi., 2.5,  Josh K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/931853787/, March 16 2018, N/A

 Enjoyable genre movie-making that answers the question "How did the rebels get the Death Star plans?" and thus serves as a prelude to Episode 4: A New Hope which most of us know to be just Star Wars (1977). Indeed we are treated to cameos by Princess Leia (young Carrie Fisher digitally) C3PO &amp R2D2 (briefly) and Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) as well as some guy in Peter Cushing make-up. (Jimmy Smits is here but I don't know why since I gave Episodes 2 and 3 a miss). The real focus here is on new characters however. It seems Mads Mikkelsen's Galen Erso designed the Death Star for the Empire under pressure even after they killed his wife and sent his daughter into hiding (with Forest Whitaker of the Rebels). As revenge he put "the flaw" into the machinery that the plans reveal. Years later his daughter Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) becomes convinced to get those Death Star plans along with Diego Luna Donnie Yen Wen Jiang Riz Ahmed and a deadpan robot named K-2SO. Aussie Ben Mendelsohn is the chief baddie (apart from D. V.). It's all action from start to finish with the typical Star Wars blend of smart-ass dialogue bonding and sentimentality and good vs. evil shoot-em-ups. There are attempts to create distinct characters but they are not much more than pieces on the chess board here totemic though some may be. In the end the film looks good (CGI) and director Gareth Edwards keeps things moving at a good pace (however like many films today it is probably a bit too long). Conclusion: if you like the franchise this is well worth your time., 3.5,  Art S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/792064900/, March 15 2018, N/A

 "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" was an exciting sci-fi film that added well to the saga particularly to the original Star Wars film. The well-blended action originality and nostalgia made this film fun to watch from beginning to end. The performances by the characters were solid. Ben Mendelsohn's portrayal of Orson Krennic was my favorite performance of the film. He was a very believable intense villain with a decent amount of depth. However despite how much I enjoyed this film it definitely wasn't perfect.<br><br>My first issue with the film was the music. This had nothing to do with the fact that there was no opening crawl I actually appreciated that. I just thought that the music was sub-par in comparison to the rest of the saga. Now I don't think that the music was totally deplorable it just seemed like amateur work at certain points (i.e. the beginning). I also had a hard time investing in the majority of the characters. My least favorite character was Saw Guerrera. I couldn't stand his voice and really couldn't take hime seriously at all. In fact I disliked the majority of the first act with the exception of the very beginning and all the action which was great and explained Jyn's origins. My least favorite part was the giant-octopus scene. That was just weird and made Saw look like a complete joke.<br><br>Thankfully this movie really picked up in the second and 3rd act and totally saved it for me. Despite the iffy CGI I loved Tarkin's role in the film and Vader's scenes we're awesome. The final space battles we're a blast and looked very real with the blend of CGI/practical effects. The drama of the film also picked up in the third act which actually had me invested in the characters unlike the first act.<br><br>Overall "Rogue One" was a great film that really added to the original Star Wars narrative. When I left the theater the first thing I wanted to do was watch the original Star Wars film which for me meant that this new film was a job well done!, 3.5,  Jacob W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/968029823/, March 13 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a solid action packed star wars movie worthy of its place in the Star wars universe with a great collection of rag tag crew led by Felicity Jones this movie pulls us. A motley crew up against a monumental task it is reminiscent of "The Bridge on the River Kwai" impossible mission movies. It also solves one of the longest problems in the star wars story the vulnerability of the death star it fills in a gap with a great deal of wonderful movie magic. its climatic end is as sad as it is satisfying and the ending scenes as well as a few others that add the character of darth vader teases the heck out of the question will we see more of Darth Vader in the future? There some bad CGI Tarken but CGI is used to great effect in the battle scenes. Rogue One shows that the Star Wars universe is growing up the message of this movie is sometimes heros die in a good cause Its a grown up message for a grown up Star Wars., 3.5,  Oliver G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976979342/, March 10 2018, N/A

 Rogue One é realizado por Garth Edwards e tem lugar entre o episódio III (2005) e IV (1974) da saga Star Wars (1974 -). O maior elogio que posso fazer a este filme é que me fez apreciar ainda mais o episódio IV da série e o mundo de Star Wars em geral.<br><br>Devo dizer que este é um filme dedicado aos fãs da saga mas que deve também agradar a quem não acompanha fielmente a sua história. Contudo de forma a apreciar na totalidade esta experiência recomendo que tenham algum conhecimento dos restantes filmes ou até da banda desenhada.<br><br>No episódio IV sabemos que a Aliança Rebelde tem posse dos planos da Estrela da Morte assim como o conhecimento de uma pequena falha no seu projeto mas nunca soubemos como até então.<br><br>Em The Force Awakens (2015) Daisy Ridley esteve brilhante enquanto Rey agora Felicity Jones que interpreta Jyn Erso vem demonstrar que também ela é uma grande adição às estrelas femininas deste universo assim como ao elenco em geral. Ao longo do filme Jyn é uma das poucas personagens que tem de facto uma progressão individual. Sim não existe uma intenção em aprofundar as personagens neste filme e às vezes torna-se necessário para conseguirmos estabelecer um sentimento de pertença das mesmas na história ainda assim deixei-me comover em certos momentos.<br><br>Não há como não me comover quando a banda sonora de Michael Giacchino atinge o seu auge com apenas quatro semanas para a compor. A música em Star Wars é sentida como se de uma personagem se tratasse e embora neste filme não existam muitas faixas de destaque a composição é eficiente. Dê-lhe mais tempo e certamente que em futuros projetos o som será mais refinado.<br><br>O antagonista Director Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) é um vilão com uma progressão interessante ficando progressivamente mais enfurecido. Tem uma missão para concretizar e quer ficar com os merecidos créditos é um patife agradável de assistir. Também Donnie Yen que interpreta Chirrut Îmwe um ex-guardião de um templo dos Jedi que está bastante ligado à Força apresenta-se como uma personagem de relevo não só ao filme como à mitologia de Star Wars em geral. É uma personagem única num universo surpreendente.<br><br>K-2SO o novo robô foi uma presença necessária neste filme de guerra. Tudo desde os cenários às expressões e falas das personagens indicavam um clima de tensão e irritabilidade. Até mesmo a Aliança Rebelde por vezes tinha de cometer atos que não os deixavam muito orgulhosos. Este robô não só ajudou a harmonizar o ambiente com o seu sentido de humor sarcástico como também a monotonia que por vezes se sentia. Não de uma forma penosa ou nada que se parecesse mas à medida que o filme progredia mais sentíamos o que podíamos esperar dele.<br><br>O terceiro ato foi um dos melhores que a saga oferece. Principalmente os últimos trinta minutos que foram uma (muitas!) explosão de ação com a narrativa dividida em três pontos principais. Todas as cenas prenderam ao ecrã e fizeram-me estar investido no filme. No final há uma sequência em particular que certamente irá entrar no pódio dos melhores momentos de toda a saga. É um final digno e apropriado para um dos meus filmes preferidos de Star Wars.<br><br>8/10, 4.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976856229/, March 10 2018, N/A
 The best Star Wars movie from a visual perspective. The story is good because it's gritty and actually tries to build credit with the audience. The biggest effect the movie has on the Star Wars universe is that it shows what the new trilogy (episodes 8 and 9) could have been instead of the mindless mess that they new trilogy has become. Apparently Disney can make a half-way decent Star Wars movie when they really want to. What a shame they've blown it with Episode 8 and particularly the disaster that was Episode 9., 4.0,  Mark S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977000071/, March 20 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a good spinoff. Originality is there acting is there and the visuals are there. The story itself though is kind of........ not.

 This movie had many flaws with pacing and it felt very slow at times and dragging on all of the scenes seemed cut together in no manner that felt like it benefited the story. The characters are not all too likable except brief character building moments that are cut short for a action sequence. All of the interesting story beats are not monopolized on and it seems that they focused too much on making a movie that gave you information and not a story. This entire movie is based on a single throw away line from a character in another Star Wars movie and it shows. The writing has many good moments and other terrible ones I enjoyed all of the acting especially that of Diego Luno who was a very good part of the movie unfortunately none of the characters sold the team aspect of the movie and only seemed like a bunch of stranger who ran into each other this theme was still present at the end of the film. I thought this was an okay film but the potential was wasted with many of the scenes there are many amazing moments but overall the film lacks a good story and character development in my opinion. This is still a very watchable film and you will find out very interesting things about the Star Wars universe you didn't know and some of them seem as if you didn't even ask but are given the answer anyway. You can tell the creators are real Star Wars fans though and it is very well made the visuals are stunning but it seems at times whole sequences were cut short and that parts of the movie just went missing on the cutting room floor which is very unfortunate for a promising film like this. You should still watch this film if you enjoy Star Wars movies though but I might say it's not for the average viewer but you might like it if you're into sci-fi., 2.5,  Josh K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/931853787/, March 16 2018, N/A

 Very underwhelming knowing that it's a Star Wars film but is fun at time. K2SO is so much fun and Chirrut Imwe is a badass. The villain Krennec was very bland but the troopers were well designed and well utilized. Jones was okay as Jyn Erso but wasn't as heroic as I predicted. Besides some fun action scenes Rogue One was a major disappointment and leaves me pessimistic looking at the future of the Star Wars side stories., 3.0,  A.J.

 "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" was an exciting sci-fi film that added well to the saga particularly to the original Star Wars film. The well-blended action originality and nostalgia made this film fun to watch from beginning to end. The performances by the characters were solid. Ben Mendelsohn's portrayal of Orson Krennic was my favorite performance of the film. He was a very believable intense villain with a decent amount of depth. However despite how much I enjoyed this film it definitely wasn't perfect.<br><br>My first issue with the film was the music. This had nothing to do with the fact that there was no opening crawl I actually appreciated that. I just thought that the music was sub-par in comparison to the rest of the saga. Now I don't think that the music was totally deplorable it just seemed like amateur work at certain points (i.e. the beginning). I also had a hard time investing in the majority of the characters. My least favorite character was Saw Guerrera. I couldn't stand his voice and really couldn't take hime seriously at all. In fact I disliked the majority of the first act with the exception of the very beginning and all the action which was great and explained Jyn's origins. My least favorite part was the giant-octopus scene. That was just weird and made Saw look like a complete joke.<br><br>Thankfully this movie really picked up in the second and 3rd act and totally saved it for me. Despite the iffy CGI I loved Tarkin's role in the film and Vader's scenes we're awesome. The final space battles we're a blast and looked very real with the blend of CGI/practical effects. The drama of the film also picked up in the third act which actually had me invested in the characters unlike the first act.<br><br>Overall "Rogue One" was a great film that really added to the original Star Wars narrative. When I left the theater the first thing I wanted to do was watch the original Star Wars film which for me meant that this new film was a job well done!, 3.5,  Jacob W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/968029823/, March 13 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a solid action packed star wars movie worthy of its place in the Star wars universe with a great collection of rag tag crew led by Felicity Jones this movie pulls us. A motley crew up against a monumental task it is reminiscent of "The Bridge on the River Kwai" impossible mission movies. It also solves one of the longest problems in the star wars story the vulnerability of the death star it fills in a gap with a great deal of wonderful movie magic. its climatic end is as sad as it is satisfying and the ending scenes as well as a few others that add the character of darth vader teases the heck out of the question will we see more of Darth Vader in the future? There some bad CGI Tarken but CGI is used to great effect in the battle scenes. Rogue One shows that the Star Wars universe is growing up the message of this movie is sometimes heros die in a good cause Its a grown up message for a grown up Star Wars., 3.5,  Oliver G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976979342/, March 10 2018, N/A

 Rogue One é realizado por Garth Edwards e tem lugar entre o episódio III (2005) e IV (1974) da saga Star Wars (1974 -). O maior elogio que posso fazer a este filme é que me fez apreciar ainda mais o episódio IV da série e o mundo de Star Wars em geral.<br><br>Devo dizer que este é um filme dedicado aos fãs da saga mas que deve também agradar a quem não acompanha fielmente a sua história. Contudo de forma a apreciar na totalidade esta experiência recomendo que tenham algum conhecimento dos restantes filmes ou até da banda desenhada.<br><br>No episódio IV sabemos que a Aliança Rebelde tem posse dos planos da Estrela da Morte assim como o conhecimento de uma pequena falha no seu projeto mas nunca soubemos como até então.<br><br>Em The Force Awakens (2015) Daisy Ridley esteve brilhante enquanto Rey agora Felicity Jones que interpreta Jyn Erso vem demonstrar que também ela é uma grande adição às estrelas femininas deste universo assim como ao elenco em geral. Ao longo do filme Jyn é uma das poucas personagens que tem de facto uma progressão individual. Sim não existe uma intenção em aprofundar as personagens neste filme e às vezes torna-se necessário para conseguirmos estabelecer um sentimento de pertença das mesmas na história ainda assim deixei-me comover em certos momentos.<br><br>Não há como não me comover quando a banda sonora de Michael Giacchino atinge o seu auge com apenas quatro semanas para a compor. A música em Star Wars é sentida como se de uma personagem se tratasse e embora neste filme não existam muitas faixas de destaque a composição é eficiente. Dê-lhe mais tempo e certamente que em futuros projetos o som será mais refinado.<br><br>O antagonista Director Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) é um vilão com uma progressão interessante ficando progressivamente mais enfurecido. Tem uma missão para concretizar e quer ficar com os merecidos créditos é um patife agradável de assistir. Também Donnie Yen que interpreta Chirrut Îmwe um ex-guardião de um templo dos Jedi que está bastante ligado à Força apresenta-se como uma personagem de relevo não só ao filme como à mitologia de Star Wars em geral. É uma personagem única num universo surpreendente.<br><br>K-2SO o novo robô foi uma presença necessária neste filme de guerra. Tudo desde os cenários às expressões e falas das personagens indicavam um clima de tensão e irritabilidade. Até mesmo a Aliança Rebelde por vezes tinha de cometer atos que não os deixavam muito orgulhosos. Este robô não só ajudou a harmonizar o ambiente com o seu sentido de humor sarcástico como também a monotonia que por vezes se sentia. Não de uma forma penosa ou nada que se parecesse mas à medida que o filme progredia mais sentíamos o que podíamos esperar dele.<br><br>O terceiro ato foi um dos melhores que a saga oferece. Principalmente os últimos trinta minutos que foram uma (muitas!) explosão de ação com a narrativa dividida em três pontos principais. Todas as cenas prenderam ao ecrã e fizeram-me estar investido no filme. No final há uma sequência em particular que certamente irá entrar no pódio dos melhores momentos de toda a saga. É um final digno e apropriado para um dos meus filmes preferidos de Star Wars.<br><br>8/10, 4.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976856229/, March 10 2018, N/A
 The best Star Wars movie from a visual perspective. The story is good because it's gritty and actually tries to build credit with the audience. The biggest effect the movie has on the Star Wars universe is that it shows what the new trilogy (episodes 8 and 9) could have been instead of the mindless mess that they new trilogy has become. Apparently Disney can make a half-way decent Star Wars movie when they really want to. What a shame they've blown it with Episode 8 and particularly the disaster that was Episode 9., 4.0,  Mark S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977000071/, March 20 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a good spinoff. Originality is there acting is there and the visuals are there. The story itself though is kind of........ not. While the characters are very well put together and character development is solid the story is empty and somewhat confusing at times.

 This movie had many flaws with pacing and it felt very slow at times and dragging on all of the scenes seemed cut together in no manner that felt like it benefited the story. The characters are not all too likable except brief character building moments that are cut short for a action sequence. All of the interesting story beats are not monopolized on and it seems that they focused too much on making a movie that gave you information and not a story. This entire movie is based on a single throw away line from a character in another Star Wars movie and it shows. The writing has many good moments and other terrible ones I enjoyed all of the acting especially that of Diego Luno who was a very good part of the movie unfortunately none of the characters sold the team aspect of the movie and only seemed like a bunch of stranger who ran into each other this theme was still present at the end of the film. I thought this was an okay film but the potential was wasted with many of the scenes there are many amazing moments but overall the film lacks a good story and character development in my opinion. This is still a very watchable film and you will find out very interesting things about the Star Wars universe you didn't know and some of them seem as if you didn't even ask but are given the answer anyway. You can tell the creators are real Star Wars fans though and it is very well made the visuals are stunning but it seems at times whole sequences were cut short and that parts of the movie just went missing on the cutting room floor which is very unfortunate for a promising film like this. You should still watch this film if you enjoy Star Wars movies though but I might say it's not for the average viewer but you might like it if you're into sci-fi., 2.5,  Josh K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/931853787/, March 16 2018, N/A

 Very underwhelming knowing that it's a Star Wars film but is fun at time. K2SO is so much fun and Chirrut Imwe is a badass. The villain Krennec was very bland but the troopers were well designed and well utilized. Jones was okay as Jyn Erso but wasn't as heroic as I predicted. Besides some fun action scenes Rogue One was a major disappointment and leaves me pessimistic looking at the future of the Star Wars side stories., 3.0,  A.J.

 Enjoyable genre movie-making that answers the question "How did the rebels get the Death Star plans?" and thus serves as a prelude to Episode 4: A New Hope which most of us know to be just Star Wars (1977). Indeed we are treated to cameos by Princess Leia (young Carrie Fisher digitally) C3PO &amp R2D2 (briefly) and Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) as well as some guy in Peter Cushing make-up. (Jimmy Smits is here but I don't know why since I gave Episodes 2 and 3 a miss). The real focus here is on new characters however. It seems Mads Mikkelsen's Galen Erso designed the Death Star for the Empire under pressure even after they killed his wife and sent his daughter into hiding (with Forest Whitaker of the Rebels). As revenge he put "the flaw" into the machinery that the plans reveal. Years later his daughter Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) becomes convinced to get those Death Star plans along with Diego Luna Donnie Yen Wen Jiang Riz Ahmed and a deadpan robot named K-2SO. Aussie Ben Mendelsohn is the chief baddie (apart from D. V.). It's all action from start to finish with the typical Star Wars blend of smart-ass dialogue bonding and sentimentality and good vs. evil shoot-em-ups. There are attempts to create distinct characters but they are not much more than pieces on the chess board here totemic though some may be.

Ben Mendelsohn's portrayal of Orson Krennic was my favorite performance of the film. He was a very believable intense villain with a decent amount of depth. However despite how much I enjoyed this film it definitely wasn't perfect.<br><br>My first issue with the film was the music. This had nothing to do with the fact that there was no opening crawl I actually appreciated that. I just thought that the music was sub-par in comparison to the rest of the saga. Now I don't think that the music was totally deplorable it just seemed like amateur work at certain points (i.e. the beginning). I also had a hard time investing in the majority of the characters. My least favorite character was Saw Guerrera. I couldn't stand his voice and really couldn't take hime seriously at all. In fact I disliked the majority of the first act with the exception of the very beginning and all the action which was great and explained Jyn's origins. My least favorite part was the giant-octopus scene. That was just weird and made Saw look like a complete joke.<br><br>Thankfully this movie really picked up in the second and 3rd act and totally saved it for me. Despite the iffy CGI I loved Tarkin's role in the film and Vader's scenes we're awesome. The final space battles we're a blast and looked very real with the blend of CGI/practical effects. The drama of the film also picked up in the third act which actually had me invested in the characters unlike the first act.<br><br>Overall "Rogue One" was a great film that really added to the original Star Wars narrative. When I left the theater the first thing I wanted to do was watch the original Star Wars film which for me meant that this new film was a job well done!, 3.5,  Jacob W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/968029823/, March 13 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a solid action packed star wars movie worthy of its place in the Star wars universe with a great collection of rag tag crew led by Felicity Jones this movie pulls us. A motley crew up against a monumental task it is reminiscent of "The Bridge on the River Kwai" impossible mission movies. It also solves one of the longest problems in the star wars story the vulnerability of the death star it fills in a gap with a great deal of wonderful movie magic. its climatic end is as sad as it is satisfying and the ending scenes as well as a few others that add the character of darth vader teases the heck out of the question will we see more of Darth Vader in the future? There some bad CGI Tarken but CGI is used to great effect in the battle scenes. Rogue One shows that the Star Wars universe is growing up the message of this movie is sometimes heros die in a good cause Its a grown up message for a grown up Star Wars., 3.5,  Oliver G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976979342/, March 10 2018, N/A

 Rogue One é realizado por Garth Edwards e tem lugar entre o episódio III (2005) e IV (1974) da saga Star Wars (1974 -). O maior elogio que posso fazer a este filme é que me fez apreciar ainda mais o episódio IV da série e o mundo de Star Wars em geral.<br><br>Devo dizer que este é um filme dedicado aos fãs da saga mas que deve também agradar a quem não acompanha fielmente a sua história. Contudo de forma a apreciar na totalidade esta experiência recomendo que tenham algum conhecimento dos restantes filmes ou até da banda desenhada.<br><br>No episódio IV sabemos que a Aliança Rebelde tem posse dos planos da Estrela da Morte assim como o conhecimento de uma pequena falha no seu projeto mas nunca soubemos como até então.<br><br>Em The Force Awakens (2015) Daisy Ridley esteve brilhante enquanto Rey agora Felicity Jones que interpreta Jyn Erso vem demonstrar que também ela é uma grande adição às estrelas femininas deste universo assim como ao elenco em geral. Ao longo do filme Jyn é uma das poucas personagens que tem de facto uma progressão individual. Sim não existe uma intenção em aprofundar as personagens neste filme e às vezes torna-se necessário para conseguirmos estabelecer um sentimento de pertença das mesmas na história ainda assim deixei-me comover em certos momentos.<br><br>Não há como não me comover quando a banda sonora de Michael Giacchino atinge o seu auge com apenas quatro semanas para a compor. A música em Star Wars é sentida como se de uma personagem se tratasse e embora neste filme não existam muitas faixas de destaque a composição é eficiente. Dê-lhe mais tempo e certamente que em futuros projetos o som será mais refinado.<br><br>O antagonista Director Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) é um vilão com uma progressão interessante ficando progressivamente mais enfurecido. Tem uma missão para concretizar e quer ficar com os merecidos créditos é um patife agradável de assistir. Também Donnie Yen que interpreta Chirrut Îmwe um ex-guardião de um templo dos Jedi que está bastante ligado à Força apresenta-se como uma personagem de relevo não só ao filme como à mitologia de Star Wars em geral. É uma personagem única num universo surpreendente.<br><br>K-2SO o novo robô foi uma presença necessária neste filme de guerra. Tudo desde os cenários às expressões e falas das personagens indicavam um clima de tensão e irritabilidade. Até mesmo a Aliança Rebelde por vezes tinha de cometer atos que não os deixavam muito orgulhosos. Este robô não só ajudou a harmonizar o ambiente com o seu sentido de humor sarcástico como também a monotonia que por vezes se sentia. Não de uma forma penosa ou nada que se parecesse mas à medida que o filme progredia mais sentíamos o que podíamos esperar dele.<br><br>O terceiro ato foi um dos melhores que a saga oferece. Principalmente os últimos trinta minutos que foram uma (muitas!) explosão de ação com a narrativa dividida em três pontos principais. Todas as cenas prenderam ao ecrã e fizeram-me estar investido no filme. No final há uma sequência em particular que certamente irá entrar no pódio dos melhores momentos de toda a saga. É um final digno e apropriado para um dos meus filmes preferidos de Star Wars.<br><br>8/10, 4.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976856229/, March 10 2018, N/A
 The best Star Wars movie from a visual perspective. The story is good because it's gritty and actually tries to build credit with the audience. The biggest effect the movie has on the Star Wars universe is that it shows what the new trilogy (episodes 8 and 9) could have been instead of the mindless mess that they new trilogy has become. Apparently Disney can make a half-way decent Star Wars movie when they really want to. What a shame they've blown it with Episode 8 and particularly the disaster that was Episode 9., 4.0,  Mark S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977000071/, March 20 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a good spinoff. Originality is there acting is there and the visuals are there. The story itself though is kind of........ not. While the characters are very well put together and character development is solid the story is empty and somewhat confusing at times. Also let me stress this as much as I can if Star Wars does not have lightsabers than its not Star Wars., 3.0,  Smith T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977170552/, March 19 2018, N/A

 Despite being very fond of the original Star Wars trilogy I've always been more of a Star Trek fan than Star Wars and the recent Star Wars movies have only served to reinforce my preference and left me uninterested This movie however gets 10/10 and were all the Star Wars movies as good as this would certainly change the balance of the preference force., 5.0,  James C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/937277817/, March 17 2018, N/A
 This movie had many flaws with pacing and it felt very slow at times and dragging on all of the scenes seemed cut together in no manner that felt like it benefited the story. The characters are not all too likable except brief character building moments that are cut short for a action sequence. All of the interesting story beats are not monopolized on and it seems that they focused too much on making a movie that gave you information and not a story. This entire movie is based on a single throw away line from a character in another Star Wars movie and it shows. The writing has many good moments and other terrible ones I enjoyed all of the acting especially that of Diego Luno who was a very good part of the movie unfortunately none of the characters sold the team aspect of the movie and only seemed like a bunch of stranger who ran into each other this theme was still present at the end of the film. I thought this was an okay film but the potential was wasted with many of the scenes there are many amazing moments but overall the film lacks a good story and character development in my opinion. This is still a very watchable film and you will find out very interesting things about the Star Wars universe you didn't know and some of them seem as if you didn't even ask but are given the answer anyway. You can tell the creators are real Star Wars fans though and it is very well made the visuals are stunning but it seems at times whole sequences were cut short and that parts of the movie just went missing on the cutting room floor which is very unfortunate for a promising film like this. You should still watch this film if you enjoy Star Wars movies though but I might say it's not for the average viewer but you might like it if you're into sci-fi., 2.5,  Josh K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/931853787/, March 16 2018, N/A

 Very underwhelming knowing that it's a Star Wars film but is fun at time. K2SO is so much fun and Chirrut Imwe is a badass. The villain Krennec was very bland but the troopers were well designed and well utilized. Jones was okay as Jyn Erso but wasn't as heroic as I predicted. Besides some fun action scenes Rogue One was a major disappointment and leaves me pessimistic looking at the future of the Star Wars side stories., 3.0,  A.J.

 Enjoyable genre movie-making that answers the question "How did the rebels get the Death Star plans?" and thus serves as a prelude to Episode 4: A New Hope which most of us know to be just Star Wars (1977). Indeed we are treated to cameos by Princess Leia (young Carrie Fisher digitally) C3PO &amp R2D2 (briefly) and Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) as well as some guy in Peter Cushing make-up. (Jimmy Smits is here but I don't know why since I gave Episodes 2 and 3 a miss). The real focus here is on new characters however. It seems Mads Mikkelsen's Galen Erso designed the Death Star for the Empire under pressure even after they killed his wife and sent his daughter into hiding (with Forest Whitaker of the Rebels). As revenge he put "the flaw" into the machinery that the plans reveal. Years later his daughter Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) becomes convinced to get those Death Star plans along with Diego Luna Donnie Yen Wen Jiang Riz Ahmed and a deadpan robot named K-2SO. Aussie Ben Mendelsohn is the chief baddie (apart from D. V.). It's all action from start to finish with the typical Star Wars blend of smart-ass dialogue bonding and sentimentality and good vs. evil shoot-em-ups. There are attempts to create distinct characters but they are not much more than pieces on the chess board here totemic though some may be. In the end the film looks good (CGI) and director Gareth Edwards keeps things moving at a good pace (however like many films today it is probably a bit too long). Conclusion: if you like the franchise this is well worth your time., 3.5,  Art S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/792064900/, March 15 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a solid action packed star wars movie worthy of its place in the Star wars universe with a great collection of rag tag crew led by Felicity Jones this movie pulls us. A motley crew up against a monumental task it is reminiscent of "The Bridge on the River Kwai" impossible mission movies. It also solves one of the longest problems in the star wars story the vulnerability of the death star it fills in a gap with a great deal of wonderful movie magic. its climatic end is as sad as it is satisfying and the ending scenes as well as a few others that add the character of darth vader teases the heck out of the question will we see more of Darth Vader in the future? There some bad CGI Tarken but CGI is used to great effect in the battle scenes. Rogue One shows that the Star Wars universe is growing up the message of this movie is sometimes heros die in a good cause Its a grown up message for a grown up Star Wars., 3.5,  Oliver G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976979342/, March 10 2018, N/A

 Rogue One é realizado por Garth Edwards e tem lugar entre o episódio III (2005) e IV (1974) da saga Star Wars (1974 -). O maior elogio que posso fazer a este filme é que me fez apreciar ainda mais o episódio IV da série e o mundo de Star Wars em geral.<br><br>Devo dizer que este é um filme dedicado aos fãs da saga mas que deve também agradar a quem não acompanha fielmente a sua história. Contudo de forma a apreciar na totalidade esta experiência recomendo que tenham algum conhecimento dos restantes filmes ou até da banda desenhada.<br><br>No episódio IV sabemos que a Aliança Rebelde tem posse dos planos da Estrela da Morte assim como o conhecimento de uma pequena falha no seu projeto mas nunca soubemos como até então.<br><br>Em The Force Awakens (2015) Daisy Ridley esteve brilhante enquanto Rey agora Felicity Jones que interpreta Jyn Erso vem demonstrar que também ela é uma grande adição às estrelas femininas deste universo assim como ao elenco em geral. Ao longo do filme Jyn é uma das poucas personagens que tem de facto uma progressão individual. Sim não existe uma intenção em aprofundar as personagens neste filme e às vezes torna-se necessário para conseguirmos estabelecer um sentimento de pertença das mesmas na história ainda assim deixei-me comover em certos momentos.<br><br>Não há como não me comover quando a banda sonora de Michael Giacchino atinge o seu auge com apenas quatro semanas para a compor. A música em Star Wars é sentida como se de uma personagem se tratasse e embora neste filme não existam muitas faixas de destaque a composição é eficiente. Dê-lhe mais tempo e certamente que em futuros projetos o som será mais refinado.<br><br>O antagonista Director Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) é um vilão com uma progressão interessante ficando progressivamente mais enfurecido. Tem uma missão para concretizar e quer ficar com os merecidos créditos é um patife agradável de assistir. Também Donnie Yen que interpreta Chirrut Îmwe um ex-guardião de um templo dos Jedi que está bastante ligado à Força apresenta-se como uma personagem de relevo não só ao filme como à mitologia de Star Wars em geral. É uma personagem única num universo surpreendente.<br><br>K-2SO o novo robô foi uma presença necessária neste filme de guerra. Tudo desde os cenários às expressões e falas das personagens indicavam um clima de tensão e irritabilidade. Até mesmo a Aliança Rebelde por vezes tinha de cometer atos que não os deixavam muito orgulhosos. Este robô não só ajudou a harmonizar o ambiente com o seu sentido de humor sarcástico como também a monotonia que por vezes se sentia. Não de uma forma penosa ou nada que se parecesse mas à medida que o filme progredia mais sentíamos o que podíamos esperar dele.<br><br>O terceiro ato foi um dos melhores que a saga oferece. Principalmente os últimos trinta minutos que foram uma (muitas!) explosão de ação com a narrativa dividida em três pontos principais. Todas as cenas prenderam ao ecrã e fizeram-me estar investido no filme. No final há uma sequência em particular que certamente irá entrar no pódio dos melhores momentos de toda a saga. É um final digno e apropriado para um dos meus filmes preferidos de Star Wars.<br><br>8/10, 4.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976856229/, March 10 2018, N/A
 The best Star Wars movie from a visual perspective. The story is good because it's gritty and actually tries to build credit with the audience. The biggest effect the movie has on the Star Wars universe is that it shows what the new trilogy (episodes 8 and 9) could have been instead of the mindless mess that they new trilogy has become. Apparently Disney can make a half-way decent Star Wars movie when they really want to. What a shame they've blown it with Episode 8 and particularly the disaster that was Episode 9., 4.0,  Mark S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977000071/, March 20 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a good spinoff. Originality is there acting is there and the visuals are there. The story itself though is kind of........ not. While the characters are very well put together and character development is solid the story is empty and somewhat confusing at times. Also let me stress this as much as I can if Star Wars does not have lightsabers than its not Star Wars., 3.0,  Smith T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977170552/, March 19 2018, N/A

 Despite being very fond of the original Star Wars trilogy I've always been more of a Star Trek fan than Star Wars and the recent Star Wars movies have only served to reinforce my preference and left me uninterested This movie however gets 10/10 and were all the Star Wars movies as good as this would certainly change the balance of the preference force., 5.0,  James C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/937277817/, March 17 2018, N/A
 This movie had many flaws with pacing and it felt very slow at times and dragging on all of the scenes seemed cut together in no manner that felt like it benefited the story. The characters are not all too likable except brief character building moments that are cut short for a action sequence. All of the interesting story beats are not monopolized on and it seems that they focused too much on making a movie that gave you information and not a story. This entire movie is based on a single throw away line from a character in another Star Wars movie and it shows. The writing has many good moments and other terrible ones I enjoyed all of the acting especially that of Diego Luno who was a very good part of the movie unfortunately none of the characters sold the team aspect of the movie and only seemed like a bunch of stranger who ran into each other this theme was still present at the end of the film. I thought this was an okay film but the potential was wasted with many of the scenes there are many amazing moments but overall the film lacks a good story and character development in my opinion. This is still a very watchable film and you will find out very interesting things about the Star Wars universe you didn't know and some of them seem as if you didn't even ask but are given the answer anyway. You can tell the creators are real Star Wars fans though and it is very well made the visuals are stunning but it seems at times whole sequences were cut short and that parts of the movie just went missing on the cutting room floor which is very unfortunate for a promising film like this. You should still watch this film if you enjoy Star Wars movies though but I might say it's not for the average viewer but you might like it if you're into sci-fi., 2.5,  Josh K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/931853787/, March 16 2018, N/A

 Very underwhelming knowing that it's a Star Wars film but is fun at time. K2SO is so much fun and Chirrut Imwe is a badass. The villain Krennec was very bland but the troopers were well designed and well utilized. Jones was okay as Jyn Erso but wasn't as heroic as I predicted. Besides some fun action scenes Rogue One was a major disappointment and leaves me pessimistic looking at the future of the Star Wars side stories., 3.0,  A.J.

 Enjoyable genre movie-making that answers the question "How did the rebels get the Death Star plans?" and thus serves as a prelude to Episode 4: A New Hope which most of us know to be just Star Wars (1977). Indeed we are treated to cameos by Princess Leia (young Carrie Fisher digitally) C3PO &amp R2D2 (briefly) and Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) as well as some guy in Peter Cushing make-up. (Jimmy Smits is here but I don't know why since I gave Episodes 2 and 3 a miss). The real focus here is on new characters however. It seems Mads Mikkelsen's Galen Erso designed the Death Star for the Empire under pressure even after they killed his wife and sent his daughter into hiding (with Forest Whitaker of the Rebels). As revenge he put "the flaw" into the machinery that the plans reveal. Years later his daughter Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) becomes convinced to get those Death Star plans along with Diego Luna Donnie Yen Wen Jiang Riz Ahmed and a deadpan robot named K-2SO. Aussie Ben Mendelsohn is the chief baddie (apart from D. V.). It's all action from start to finish with the typical Star Wars blend of smart-ass dialogue bonding and sentimentality and good vs. evil shoot-em-ups. There are attempts to create distinct characters but they are not much more than pieces on the chess board here totemic though some may be. In the end the film looks good (CGI) and director Gareth Edwards keeps things moving at a good pace (however like many films today it is probably a bit too long). Conclusion: if you like the franchise this is well worth your time., 3.5,  Art S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/792064900/, March 15 2018, N/A

 "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" was an exciting sci-fi film that added well to the saga particularly to the original Star Wars film. The well-blended action originality and nostalgia made this film fun to watch from beginning to end. The performances by the characters were solid. Ben Mendelsohn's portrayal of Orson Krennic was my favorite performance of the film. He was a very believable intense villain with a decent amount of depth. However despite how much I enjoyed this film it definitely wasn't perfect.<br><br>My first issue with the film was the music. This had nothing to do with the fact that there was no opening crawl I actually appreciated that. I just thought that the music was sub-par in comparison to the rest of the saga. Now I don't think that the music was totally deplorable it just seemed like amateur work at certain points (i.e. the beginning). I also had a hard time investing in the majority of the characters. My least favorite character was Saw Guerrera. I couldn't stand his voice and really couldn't take hime seriously at all. In fact I disliked the majority of the first act with the exception of the very beginning and all the action which was great and explained Jyn's origins. My least favorite part was the giant-octopus scene. That was just weird and made Saw look like a complete joke.<br><br>Thankfully this movie really picked up in the second and 3rd act and totally saved it for me. Despite the iffy CGI I loved Tarkin's role in the film and Vader's scenes we're awesome. The final space battles we're a blast and looked very real with the blend of CGI/practical effects.

Rogue One shows that the Star Wars universe is growing up the message of this movie is sometimes heros die in a good cause Its a grown up message for a grown up Star Wars., 3.5,  Oliver G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976979342/, March 10 2018, N/A

 Rogue One é realizado por Garth Edwards e tem lugar entre o episódio III (2005) e IV (1974) da saga Star Wars (1974 -). O maior elogio que posso fazer a este filme é que me fez apreciar ainda mais o episódio IV da série e o mundo de Star Wars em geral.<br><br>Devo dizer que este é um filme dedicado aos fãs da saga mas que deve também agradar a quem não acompanha fielmente a sua história. Contudo de forma a apreciar na totalidade esta experiência recomendo que tenham algum conhecimento dos restantes filmes ou até da banda desenhada.<br><br>No episódio IV sabemos que a Aliança Rebelde tem posse dos planos da Estrela da Morte assim como o conhecimento de uma pequena falha no seu projeto mas nunca soubemos como até então.<br><br>Em The Force Awakens (2015) Daisy Ridley esteve brilhante enquanto Rey agora Felicity Jones que interpreta Jyn Erso vem demonstrar que também ela é uma grande adição às estrelas femininas deste universo assim como ao elenco em geral. Ao longo do filme Jyn é uma das poucas personagens que tem de facto uma progressão individual. Sim não existe uma intenção em aprofundar as personagens neste filme e às vezes torna-se necessário para conseguirmos estabelecer um sentimento de pertença das mesmas na história ainda assim deixei-me comover em certos momentos.<br><br>Não há como não me comover quando a banda sonora de Michael Giacchino atinge o seu auge com apenas quatro semanas para a compor. A música em Star Wars é sentida como se de uma personagem se tratasse e embora neste filme não existam muitas faixas de destaque a composição é eficiente. Dê-lhe mais tempo e certamente que em futuros projetos o som será mais refinado.<br><br>O antagonista Director Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) é um vilão com uma progressão interessante ficando progressivamente mais enfurecido. Tem uma missão para concretizar e quer ficar com os merecidos créditos é um patife agradável de assistir. Também Donnie Yen que interpreta Chirrut Îmwe um ex-guardião de um templo dos Jedi que está bastante ligado à Força apresenta-se como uma personagem de relevo não só ao filme como à mitologia de Star Wars em geral. É uma personagem única num universo surpreendente.<br><br>K-2SO o novo robô foi uma presença necessária neste filme de guerra. Tudo desde os cenários às expressões e falas das personagens indicavam um clima de tensão e irritabilidade. Até mesmo a Aliança Rebelde por vezes tinha de cometer atos que não os deixavam muito orgulhosos. Este robô não só ajudou a harmonizar o ambiente com o seu sentido de humor sarcástico como também a monotonia que por vezes se sentia. Não de uma forma penosa ou nada que se parecesse mas à medida que o filme progredia mais sentíamos o que podíamos esperar dele.<br><br>O terceiro ato foi um dos melhores que a saga oferece. Principalmente os últimos trinta minutos que foram uma (muitas!) explosão de ação com a narrativa dividida em três pontos principais. Todas as cenas prenderam ao ecrã e fizeram-me estar investido no filme. No final há uma sequência em particular que certamente irá entrar no pódio dos melhores momentos de toda a saga. É um final digno e apropriado para um dos meus filmes preferidos de Star Wars.<br><br>8/10, 4.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976856229/, March 10 2018, N/A
 The best Star Wars movie from a visual perspective. The story is good because it's gritty and actually tries to build credit with the audience. The biggest effect the movie has on the Star Wars universe is that it shows what the new trilogy (episodes 8 and 9) could have been instead of the mindless mess that they new trilogy has become. Apparently Disney can make a half-way decent Star Wars movie when they really want to. What a shame they've blown it with Episode 8 and particularly the disaster that was Episode 9., 4.0,  Mark S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977000071/, March 20 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a good spinoff. Originality is there acting is there and the visuals are there. The story itself though is kind of........ not. While the characters are very well put together and character development is solid the story is empty and somewhat confusing at times.

 Despite being very fond of the original Star Wars trilogy I've always been more of a Star Trek fan than Star Wars and the recent Star Wars movies have only served to reinforce my preference and left me uninterested This movie however gets 10/10 and were all the Star Wars movies as good as this would certainly change the balance of the preference force., 5.0,  James C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/937277817/, March 17 2018, N/A
 This movie had many flaws with pacing and it felt very slow at times and dragging on all of the scenes seemed cut together in no manner that felt like it benefited the story. The characters are not all too likable except brief character building moments that are cut short for a action sequence. All of the interesting story beats are not monopolized on and it seems that they focused too much on making a movie that gave you information and not a story. This entire movie is based on a single throw away line from a character in another Star Wars movie and it shows. The writing has many good moments and other terrible ones I enjoyed all of the acting especially that of Diego Luno who was a very good part of the movie unfortunately none of the characters sold the team aspect of the movie and only seemed like a bunch of stranger who ran into each other this theme was still present at the end of the film. I thought this was an okay film but the potential was wasted with many of the scenes there are many amazing moments but overall the film lacks a good story and character development in my opinion. This is still a very watchable film and you will find out very interesting things about the Star Wars universe you didn't know and some of them seem as if you didn't even ask but are given the answer anyway. You can tell the creators are real Star Wars fans though and it is very well made the visuals are stunning but it seems at times whole sequences were cut short and that parts of the movie just went missing on the cutting room floor which is very unfortunate for a promising film like this. You should still watch this film if you enjoy Star Wars movies though but I might say it's not for the average viewer but you might like it if you're into sci-fi., 2.5,  Josh K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/931853787/, March 16 2018, N/A

 Very underwhelming knowing that it's a Star Wars film but is fun at time. K2SO is so much fun and Chirrut Imwe is a badass. The villain Krennec was very bland but the troopers were well designed and well utilized. Jones was okay as Jyn Erso but wasn't as heroic as I predicted. Besides some fun action scenes Rogue One was a major disappointment and leaves me pessimistic looking at the future of the Star Wars side stories., 3.0,  A.J.

 Enjoyable genre movie-making that answers the question "How did the rebels get the Death Star plans?" and thus serves as a prelude to Episode 4: A New Hope which most of us know to be just Star Wars (1977). Indeed we are treated to cameos by Princess Leia (young Carrie Fisher digitally) C3PO &amp R2D2 (briefly) and Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) as well as some guy in Peter Cushing make-up. (Jimmy Smits is here but I don't know why since I gave Episodes 2 and 3 a miss). The real focus here is on new characters however. It seems Mads Mikkelsen's Galen Erso designed the Death Star for the Empire under pressure even after they killed his wife and sent his daughter into hiding (with Forest Whitaker of the Rebels). As revenge he put "the flaw" into the machinery that the plans reveal. Years later his daughter Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) becomes convinced to get those Death Star plans along with Diego Luna Donnie Yen Wen Jiang Riz Ahmed and a deadpan robot named K-2SO. Aussie Ben Mendelsohn is the chief baddie (apart from D. V.). It's all action from start to finish with the typical Star Wars blend of smart-ass dialogue bonding and sentimentality and good vs. evil shoot-em-ups. There are attempts to create distinct characters but they are not much more than pieces on the chess board here totemic though some may be. In the end the film looks good (CGI) and director Gareth Edwards keeps things moving at a good pace (however like many films today it is probably a bit too long). Conclusion: if you like the franchise this is well worth your time., 3.5,  Art S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/792064900/, March 15 2018, N/A

 "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" was an exciting sci-fi film that added well to the saga particularly to the original Star Wars film. The well-blended action originality and nostalgia made this film fun to watch from beginning to end. The performances by the characters were solid. Ben Mendelsohn's portrayal of Orson Krennic was my favorite performance of the film. He was a very believable intense villain with a decent amount of depth. However despite how much I enjoyed this film it definitely wasn't perfect.<br><br>My first issue with the film was the music. This had nothing to do with the fact that there was no opening crawl I actually appreciated that. I just thought that the music was sub-par in comparison to the rest of the saga. Now I don't think that the music was totally deplorable it just seemed like amateur work at certain points (i.e. the beginning). I also had a hard time investing in the majority of the characters. My least favorite character was Saw Guerrera. I couldn't stand his voice and really couldn't take hime seriously at all. In fact I disliked the majority of the first act with the exception of the very beginning and all the action which was great and explained Jyn's origins. My least favorite part was the giant-octopus scene. That was just weird and made Saw look like a complete joke.<br><br>Thankfully this movie really picked up in the second and 3rd act and totally saved it for me. Despite the iffy CGI I loved Tarkin's role in the film and Vader's scenes we're awesome. The final space battles we're a blast and looked very real with the blend of CGI/practical effects. The drama of the film also picked up in the third act which actually had me invested in the characters unlike the first act.<br><br>Overall "Rogue One" was a great film that really added to the original Star Wars narrative. When I left the theater the first thing I wanted to do was watch the original Star Wars film which for me meant that this new film was a job well done!, 3.5,  Jacob W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/968029823/, March 13 2018, N/A

Contudo de forma a apreciar na totalidade esta experiência recomendo que tenham algum conhecimento dos restantes filmes ou até da banda desenhada.<br><br>No episódio IV sabemos que a Aliança Rebelde tem posse dos planos da Estrela da Morte assim como o conhecimento de uma pequena falha no seu projeto mas nunca soubemos como até então.<br><br>Em The Force Awakens (2015) Daisy Ridley esteve brilhante enquanto Rey agora Felicity Jones que interpreta Jyn Erso vem demonstrar que também ela é uma grande adição às estrelas femininas deste universo assim como ao elenco em geral. Ao longo do filme Jyn é uma das poucas personagens que tem de facto uma progressão individual. Sim não existe uma intenção em aprofundar as personagens neste filme e às vezes torna-se necessário para conseguirmos estabelecer um sentimento de pertença das mesmas na história ainda assim deixei-me comover em certos momentos.<br><br>Não há como não me comover quando a banda sonora de Michael Giacchino atinge o seu auge com apenas quatro semanas para a compor. A música em Star Wars é sentida como se de uma personagem se tratasse e embora neste filme não existam muitas faixas de destaque a composição é eficiente. Dê-lhe mais tempo e certamente que em futuros projetos o som será mais refinado.<br><br>O antagonista Director Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) é um vilão com uma progressão interessante ficando progressivamente mais enfurecido. Tem uma missão para concretizar e quer ficar com os merecidos créditos é um patife agradável de assistir. Também Donnie Yen que interpreta Chirrut Îmwe um ex-guardião de um templo dos Jedi que está bastante ligado à Força apresenta-se como uma personagem de relevo não só ao filme como à mitologia de Star Wars em geral. É uma personagem única num universo surpreendente.<br><br>K-2SO o novo robô foi uma presença necessária neste filme de guerra. Tudo desde os cenários às expressões e falas das personagens indicavam um clima de tensão e irritabilidade. Até mesmo a Aliança Rebelde por vezes tinha de cometer atos que não os deixavam muito orgulhosos. Este robô não só ajudou a harmonizar o ambiente com o seu sentido de humor sarcástico como também a monotonia que por vezes se sentia. Não de uma forma penosa ou nada que se parecesse mas à medida que o filme progredia mais sentíamos o que podíamos esperar dele.<br><br>O terceiro ato foi um dos melhores que a saga oferece. Principalmente os últimos trinta minutos que foram uma (muitas!) explosão de ação com a narrativa dividida em três pontos principais. Todas as cenas prenderam ao ecrã e fizeram-me estar investido no filme. No final há uma sequência em particular que certamente irá entrar no pódio dos melhores momentos de toda a saga. É um final digno e apropriado para um dos meus filmes preferidos de Star Wars.<br><br>8/10, 4.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976856229/, March 10 2018, N/A
 The best Star Wars movie from a visual perspective. The story is good because it's gritty and actually tries to build credit with the audience. The biggest effect the movie has on the Star Wars universe is that it shows what the new trilogy (episodes 8 and 9) could have been instead of the mindless mess that they new trilogy has become. Apparently Disney can make a half-way decent Star Wars movie when they really want to. What a shame they've blown it with Episode 8 and particularly the disaster that was Episode 9., 4.0,  Mark S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977000071/, March 20 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a good spinoff. Originality is there acting is there and the visuals are there. The story itself though is kind of........ not. While the characters are very well put together and character development is solid the story is empty and somewhat confusing at times. Also let me stress this as much as I can if Star Wars does not have lightsabers than its not Star Wars., 3.0,  Smith T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977170552/, March 19 2018, N/A

 Despite being very fond of the original Star Wars trilogy I've always been more of a Star Trek fan than Star Wars and the recent Star Wars movies have only served to reinforce my preference and left me uninterested This movie however gets 10/10 and were all the Star Wars movies as good as this would certainly change the balance of the preference force., 5.0,  James C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/937277817/, March 17 2018, N/A
 This movie had many flaws with pacing and it felt very slow at times and dragging on all of the scenes seemed cut together in no manner that felt like it benefited the story. The characters are not all too likable except brief character building moments that are cut short for a action sequence. All of the interesting story beats are not monopolized on and it seems that they focused too much on making a movie that gave you information and not a story. This entire movie is based on a single throw away line from a character in another Star Wars movie and it shows. The writing has many good moments and other terrible ones I enjoyed all of the acting especially that of Diego Luno who was a very good part of the movie unfortunately none of the characters sold the team aspect of the movie and only seemed like a bunch of stranger who ran into each other this theme was still present at the end of the film. I thought this was an okay film but the potential was wasted with many of the scenes there are many amazing moments but overall the film lacks a good story and character development in my opinion. This is still a very watchable film and you will find out very interesting things about the Star Wars universe you didn't know and some of them seem as if you didn't even ask but are given the answer anyway. You can tell the creators are real Star Wars fans though and it is very well made the visuals are stunning but it seems at times whole sequences were cut short and that parts of the movie just went missing on the cutting room floor which is very unfortunate for a promising film like this. You should still watch this film if you enjoy Star Wars movies though but I might say it's not for the average viewer but you might like it if you're into sci-fi., 2.5,  Josh K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/931853787/, March 16 2018, N/A
 This movie is somewhat difficult to get invested in for a while as the characters are hard to identify and aren't particularly fleshed out by the climax makes up for all of this.

 Very underwhelming knowing that it's a Star Wars film but is fun at time. K2SO is so much fun and Chirrut Imwe is a badass. The villain Krennec was very bland but the troopers were well designed and well utilized. Jones was okay as Jyn Erso but wasn't as heroic as I predicted. Besides some fun action scenes Rogue One was a major disappointment and leaves me pessimistic looking at the future of the Star Wars side stories., 3.0,  A.J.

 Enjoyable genre movie-making that answers the question "How did the rebels get the Death Star plans?" and thus serves as a prelude to Episode 4: A New Hope which most of us know to be just Star Wars (1977). Indeed we are treated to cameos by Princess Leia (young Carrie Fisher digitally) C3PO &amp R2D2 (briefly) and Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) as well as some guy in Peter Cushing make-up. (Jimmy Smits is here but I don't know why since I gave Episodes 2 and 3 a miss). The real focus here is on new characters however. It seems Mads Mikkelsen's Galen Erso designed the Death Star for the Empire under pressure even after they killed his wife and sent his daughter into hiding (with Forest Whitaker of the Rebels). As revenge he put "the flaw" into the machinery that the plans reveal. Years later his daughter Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) becomes convinced to get those Death Star plans along with Diego Luna Donnie Yen Wen Jiang Riz Ahmed and a deadpan robot named K-2SO. Aussie Ben Mendelsohn is the chief baddie (apart from D. V.). It's all action from start to finish with the typical Star Wars blend of smart-ass dialogue bonding and sentimentality and good vs. evil shoot-em-ups. There are attempts to create distinct characters but they are not much more than pieces on the chess board here totemic though some may be. In the end the film looks good (CGI) and director Gareth Edwards keeps things moving at a good pace (however like many films today it is probably a bit too long). Conclusion: if you like the franchise this is well worth your time., 3.5,  Art S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/792064900/, March 15 2018, N/A

 "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" was an exciting sci-fi film that added well to the saga particularly to the original Star Wars film. The well-blended action originality and nostalgia made this film fun to watch from beginning to end. The performances by the characters were solid. Ben Mendelsohn's portrayal of Orson Krennic was my favorite performance of the film. He was a very believable intense villain with a decent amount of depth. However despite how much I enjoyed this film it definitely wasn't perfect.<br><br>My first issue with the film was the music. This had nothing to do with the fact that there was no opening crawl I actually appreciated that. I just thought that the music was sub-par in comparison to the rest of the saga. Now I don't think that the music was totally deplorable it just seemed like amateur work at certain points (i.e. the beginning). I also had a hard time investing in the majority of the characters. My least favorite character was Saw Guerrera. I couldn't stand his voice and really couldn't take hime seriously at all. In fact I disliked the majority of the first act with the exception of the very beginning and all the action which was great and explained Jyn's origins. My least favorite part was the giant-octopus scene. That was just weird and made Saw look like a complete joke.<br><br>Thankfully this movie really picked up in the second and 3rd act and totally saved it for me. Despite the iffy CGI I loved Tarkin's role in the film and Vader's scenes we're awesome. The final space battles we're a blast and looked very real with the blend of CGI/practical effects. The drama of the film also picked up in the third act which actually had me invested in the characters unlike the first act.<br><br>Overall "Rogue One" was a great film that really added to the original Star Wars narrative. When I left the theater the first thing I wanted to do was watch the original Star Wars film which for me meant that this new film was a job well done!, 3.5,  Jacob W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/968029823/, March 13 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a solid action packed star wars movie worthy of its place in the Star wars universe with a great collection of rag tag crew led by Felicity Jones this movie pulls us. A motley crew up against a monumental task it is reminiscent of "The Bridge on the River Kwai" impossible mission movies. It also solves one of the longest problems in the star wars story the vulnerability of the death star it fills in a gap with a great deal of wonderful movie magic. its climatic end is as sad as it is satisfying and the ending scenes as well as a few others that add the character of darth vader teases the heck out of the question will we see more of Darth Vader in the future? There some bad CGI Tarken but CGI is used to great effect in the battle scenes. Rogue One shows that the Star Wars universe is growing up the message of this movie is sometimes heros die in a good cause Its a grown up message for a grown up Star Wars., 3.5,  Oliver G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976979342/, March 10 2018, N/A

 The best Star Wars movie from a visual perspective. The story is good because it's gritty and actually tries to build credit with the audience. The biggest effect the movie has on the Star Wars universe is that it shows what the new trilogy (episodes 8 and 9) could have been instead of the mindless mess that they new trilogy has become. Apparently Disney can make a half-way decent Star Wars movie when they really want to. What a shame they've blown it with Episode 8 and particularly the disaster that was Episode 9., 4.0,  Mark S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977000071/, March 20 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a good spinoff. Originality is there acting is there and the visuals are there. The story itself though is kind of........ not. While the characters are very well put together and character development is solid the story is empty and somewhat confusing at times. Also let me stress this as much as I can if Star Wars does not have lightsabers than its not Star Wars., 3.0,  Smith T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977170552/, March 19 2018, N/A

 Despite being very fond of the original Star Wars trilogy I've always been more of a Star Trek fan than Star Wars and the recent Star Wars movies have only served to reinforce my preference and left me uninterested This movie however gets 10/10 and were all the Star Wars movies as good as this would certainly change the balance of the preference force., 5.0,  James C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/937277817/, March 17 2018, N/A
 This movie had many flaws with pacing and it felt very slow at times and dragging on all of the scenes seemed cut together in no manner that felt like it benefited the story. The characters are not all too likable except brief character building moments that are cut short for a action sequence. All of the interesting story beats are not monopolized on and it seems that they focused too much on making a movie that gave you information and not a story. This entire movie is based on a single throw away line from a character in another Star Wars movie and it shows. The writing has many good moments and other terrible ones I enjoyed all of the acting especially that of Diego Luno who was a very good part of the movie unfortunately none of the characters sold the team aspect of the movie and only seemed like a bunch of stranger who ran into each other this theme was still present at the end of the film. I thought this was an okay film but the potential was wasted with many of the scenes there are many amazing moments but overall the film lacks a good story and character development in my opinion. This is still a very watchable film and you will find out very interesting things about the Star Wars universe you didn't know and some of them seem as if you didn't even ask but are given the answer anyway. You can tell the creators are real Star Wars fans though and it is very well made the visuals are stunning but it seems at times whole sequences were cut short and that parts of the movie just went missing on the cutting room floor which is very unfortunate for a promising film like this. You should still watch this film if you enjoy Star Wars movies though but I might say it's not for the average viewer but you might like it if you're into sci-fi., 2.5,  Josh K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/931853787/, March 16 2018, N/A
 This movie is somewhat difficult to get invested in for a while as the characters are hard to identify and aren't particularly fleshed out by the climax makes up for all of this.

 Very underwhelming knowing that it's a Star Wars film but is fun at time. K2SO is so much fun and Chirrut Imwe is a badass. The villain Krennec was very bland but the troopers were well designed and well utilized. Jones was okay as Jyn Erso but wasn't as heroic as I predicted. Besides some fun action scenes Rogue One was a major disappointment and leaves me pessimistic looking at the future of the Star Wars side stories., 3.0,  A.J.

 Enjoyable genre movie-making that answers the question "How did the rebels get the Death Star plans?" and thus serves as a prelude to Episode 4: A New Hope which most of us know to be just Star Wars (1977). Indeed we are treated to cameos by Princess Leia (young Carrie Fisher digitally) C3PO &amp R2D2 (briefly) and Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) as well as some guy in Peter Cushing make-up. (Jimmy Smits is here but I don't know why since I gave Episodes 2 and 3 a miss). The real focus here is on new characters however. It seems Mads Mikkelsen's Galen Erso designed the Death Star for the Empire under pressure even after they killed his wife and sent his daughter into hiding (with Forest Whitaker of the Rebels). As revenge he put "the flaw" into the machinery that the plans reveal. Years later his daughter Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) becomes convinced to get those Death Star plans along with Diego Luna Donnie Yen Wen Jiang Riz Ahmed and a deadpan robot named K-2SO. Aussie Ben Mendelsohn is the chief baddie (apart from D. V.). It's all action from start to finish with the typical Star Wars blend of smart-ass dialogue bonding and sentimentality and good vs. evil shoot-em-ups. There are attempts to create distinct characters but they are not much more than pieces on the chess board here totemic though some may be. In the end the film looks good (CGI) and director Gareth Edwards keeps things moving at a good pace (however like many films today it is probably a bit too long). Conclusion: if you like the franchise this is well worth your time., 3.5,  Art S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/792064900/, March 15 2018, N/A

 "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" was an exciting sci-fi film that added well to the saga particularly to the original Star Wars film. The well-blended action originality and nostalgia made this film fun to watch from beginning to end. The performances by the characters were solid. Ben Mendelsohn's portrayal of Orson Krennic was my favorite performance of the film. He was a very believable intense villain with a decent amount of depth. However despite how much I enjoyed this film it definitely wasn't perfect.<br><br>My first issue with the film was the music. This had nothing to do with the fact that there was no opening crawl I actually appreciated that. I just thought that the music was sub-par in comparison to the rest of the saga. Now I don't think that the music was totally deplorable it just seemed like amateur work at certain points (i.e. the beginning). I also had a hard time investing in the majority of the characters. My least favorite character was Saw Guerrera. I couldn't stand his voice and really couldn't take hime seriously at all. In fact I disliked the majority of the first act with the exception of the very beginning and all the action which was great and explained Jyn's origins. My least favorite part was the giant-octopus scene. That was just weird and made Saw look like a complete joke.<br><br>Thankfully this movie really picked up in the second and 3rd act and totally saved it for me. Despite the iffy CGI I loved Tarkin's role in the film and Vader's scenes we're awesome. The final space battles we're a blast and looked very real with the blend of CGI/practical effects. The drama of the film also picked up in the third act which actually had me invested in the characters unlike the first act.<br><br>Overall "Rogue One" was a great film that really added to the original Star Wars narrative. When I left the theater the first thing I wanted to do was watch the original Star Wars film which for me meant that this new film was a job well done!, 3.5,  Jacob W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/968029823/, March 13 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a solid action packed star wars movie worthy of its place in the Star wars universe with a great collection of rag tag crew led by Felicity Jones this movie pulls us. A motley crew up against a monumental task it is reminiscent of "The Bridge on the River Kwai" impossible mission movies. It also solves one of the longest problems in the star wars story the vulnerability of the death star it fills in a gap with a great deal of wonderful movie magic. its climatic end is as sad as it is satisfying and the ending scenes as well as a few others that add the character of darth vader teases the heck out of the question will we see more of Darth Vader in the future? There some bad CGI Tarken but CGI is used to great effect in the battle scenes. Rogue One shows that the Star Wars universe is growing up the message of this movie is sometimes heros die in a good cause Its a grown up message for a grown up Star Wars., 3.5,  Oliver G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976979342/, March 10 2018, N/A

 The best Star Wars movie from a visual perspective. The story is good because it's gritty and actually tries to build credit with the audience. The biggest effect the movie has on the Star Wars universe is that it shows what the new trilogy (episodes 8 and 9) could have been instead of the mindless mess that they new trilogy has become. Apparently Disney can make a half-way decent Star Wars movie when they really want to. What a shame they've blown it with Episode 8 and particularly the disaster that was Episode 9., 4.0,  Mark S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977000071/, March 20 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a good spinoff. Originality is there acting is there and the visuals are there. The story itself though is kind of........ not. While the characters are very well put together and character development is solid the story is empty and somewhat confusing at times. Also let me stress this as much as I can if Star Wars does not have lightsabers than its not Star Wars., 3.0,  Smith T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977170552/, March 19 2018, N/A

 Despite being very fond of the original Star Wars trilogy I've always been more of a Star Trek fan than Star Wars and the recent Star Wars movies have only served to reinforce my preference and left me uninterested This movie however gets 10/10 and were all the Star Wars movies as good as this would certainly change the balance of the preference force., 5.0,  James C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/937277817/, March 17 2018, N/A
 This movie had many flaws with pacing and it felt very slow at times and dragging on all of the scenes seemed cut together in no manner that felt like it benefited the story. The characters are not all too likable except brief character building moments that are cut short for a action sequence. All of the interesting story beats are not monopolized on and it seems that they focused too much on making a movie that gave you information and not a story. This entire movie is based on a single throw away line from a character in another Star Wars movie and it shows. The writing has many good moments and other terrible ones I enjoyed all of the acting especially that of Diego Luno who was a very good part of the movie unfortunately none of the characters sold the team aspect of the movie and only seemed like a bunch of stranger who ran into each other this theme was still present at the end of the film. I thought this was an okay film but the potential was wasted with many of the scenes there are many amazing moments but overall the film lacks a good story and character development in my opinion. This is still a very watchable film and you will find out very interesting things about the Star Wars universe you didn't know and some of them seem as if you didn't even ask but are given the answer anyway. You can tell the creators are real Star Wars fans though and it is very well made the visuals are stunning but it seems at times whole sequences were cut short and that parts of the movie just went missing on the cutting room floor which is very unfortunate for a promising film like this. You should still watch this film if you enjoy Star Wars movies though but I might say it's not for the average viewer but you might like it if you're into sci-fi., 2.5,  Josh K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/931853787/, March 16 2018, N/A
 This movie is somewhat difficult to get invested in for a while as the characters are hard to identify and aren't particularly fleshed out by the climax makes up for all of this.

 Very underwhelming knowing that it's a Star Wars film but is fun at time. K2SO is so much fun and Chirrut Imwe is a badass. The villain Krennec was very bland but the troopers were well designed and well utilized. Jones was okay as Jyn Erso but wasn't as heroic as I predicted. Besides some fun action scenes Rogue One was a major disappointment and leaves me pessimistic looking at the future of the Star Wars side stories., 3.0,  A.J.

 Enjoyable genre movie-making that answers the question "How did the rebels get the Death Star plans?" and thus serves as a prelude to Episode 4: A New Hope which most of us know to be just Star Wars (1977). Indeed we are treated to cameos by Princess Leia (young Carrie Fisher digitally) C3PO &amp R2D2 (briefly) and Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) as well as some guy in Peter Cushing make-up. (Jimmy Smits is here but I don't know why since I gave Episodes 2 and 3 a miss). The real focus here is on new characters however. It seems Mads Mikkelsen's Galen Erso designed the Death Star for the Empire under pressure even after they killed his wife and sent his daughter into hiding (with Forest Whitaker of the Rebels). As revenge he put "the flaw" into the machinery that the plans reveal. Years later his daughter Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) becomes convinced to get those Death Star plans along with Diego Luna Donnie Yen Wen Jiang Riz Ahmed and a deadpan robot named K-2SO. Aussie Ben Mendelsohn is the chief baddie (apart from D. V.). It's all action from start to finish with the typical Star Wars blend of smart-ass dialogue bonding and sentimentality and good vs. evil shoot-em-ups. There are attempts to create distinct characters but they are not much more than pieces on the chess board here totemic though some may be. In the end the film looks good (CGI) and director Gareth Edwards keeps things moving at a good pace (however like many films today it is probably a bit too long). Conclusion: if you like the franchise this is well worth your time., 3.5,  Art S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/792064900/, March 15 2018, N/A

 "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" was an exciting sci-fi film that added well to the saga particularly to the original Star Wars film. The well-blended action originality and nostalgia made this film fun to watch from beginning to end. The performances by the characters were solid. Ben Mendelsohn's portrayal of Orson Krennic was my favorite performance of the film. He was a very believable intense villain with a decent amount of depth. However despite how much I enjoyed this film it definitely wasn't perfect.<br><br>My first issue with the film was the music. This had nothing to do with the fact that there was no opening crawl I actually appreciated that. I just thought that the music was sub-par in comparison to the rest of the saga. Now I don't think that the music was totally deplorable it just seemed like amateur work at certain points (i.e. the beginning). I also had a hard time investing in the majority of the characters. My least favorite character was Saw Guerrera. I couldn't stand his voice and really couldn't take hime seriously at all. In fact I disliked the majority of the first act with the exception of the very beginning and all the action which was great and explained Jyn's origins. My least favorite part was the giant-octopus scene. That was just weird and made Saw look like a complete joke.<br><br>Thankfully this movie really picked up in the second and 3rd act and totally saved it for me. Despite the iffy CGI I loved Tarkin's role in the film and Vader's scenes we're awesome. The final space battles we're a blast and looked very real with the blend of CGI/practical effects. The drama of the film also picked up in the third act which actually had me invested in the characters unlike the first act.<br><br>Overall "Rogue One" was a great film that really added to the original Star Wars narrative. When I left the theater the first thing I wanted to do was watch the original Star Wars film which for me meant that this new film was a job well done!, 3.5,  Jacob W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/968029823/, March 13 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a solid action packed star wars movie worthy of its place in the Star wars universe with a great collection of rag tag crew led by Felicity Jones this movie pulls us. A motley crew up against a monumental task it is reminiscent of "The Bridge on the River Kwai" impossible mission movies. It also solves one of the longest problems in the star wars story the vulnerability of the death star it fills in a gap with a great deal of wonderful movie magic. its climatic end is as sad as it is satisfying and the ending scenes as well as a few others that add the character of darth vader teases the heck out of the question will we see more of Darth Vader in the future? There some bad CGI Tarken but CGI is used to great effect in the battle scenes. Rogue One shows that the Star Wars universe is growing up the message of this movie is sometimes heros die in a good cause Its a grown up message for a grown up Star Wars., 3.5,  Oliver G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976979342/, March 10 2018, N/A

 Rogue One é realizado por Garth Edwards e tem lugar entre o episódio III (2005) e IV (1974) da saga Star Wars (1974 -). O maior elogio que posso fazer a este filme é que me fez apreciar ainda mais o episódio IV da série e o mundo de Star Wars em geral.<br><br>Devo dizer que este é um filme dedicado aos fãs da saga mas que deve também agradar a quem não acompanha fielmente a sua história. Contudo de forma a apreciar na totalidade esta experiência recomendo que tenham algum conhecimento dos restantes filmes ou até da banda desenhada.<br><br>No episódio IV sabemos que a Aliança Rebelde tem posse dos planos da Estrela da Morte assim como o conhecimento de uma pequena falha no seu projeto mas nunca soubemos como até então.<br><br>Em The Force Awakens (2015) Daisy Ridley esteve brilhante enquanto Rey agora Felicity Jones que interpreta Jyn Erso vem demonstrar que também ela é uma grande adição às estrelas femininas deste universo assim como ao elenco em geral. Ao longo do filme Jyn é uma das poucas personagens que tem de facto uma progressão individual. Sim não existe uma intenção em aprofundar as personagens neste filme e às vezes torna-se necessário para conseguirmos estabelecer um sentimento de pertença das mesmas na história ainda assim deixei-me comover em certos momentos.<br><br>Não há como não me comover quando a banda sonora de Michael Giacchino atinge o seu auge com apenas quatro semanas para a compor. A música em Star Wars é sentida como se de uma personagem se tratasse e embora neste filme não existam muitas faixas de destaque a composição é eficiente. Dê-lhe mais tempo e certamente que em futuros projetos o som será mais refinado.<br><br>O antagonista Director Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) é um vilão com uma progressão interessante ficando progressivamente mais enfurecido. Tem uma missão para concretizar e quer ficar com os merecidos créditos é um patife agradável de assistir. Também Donnie Yen que interpreta Chirrut Îmwe um ex-guardião de um templo dos Jedi que está bastante ligado à Força apresenta-se como uma personagem de relevo não só ao filme como à mitologia de Star Wars em geral. É uma personagem única num universo surpreendente.<br><br>K-2SO o novo robô foi uma presença necessária neste filme de guerra. Tudo desde os cenários às expressões e falas das personagens indicavam um clima de tensão e irritabilidade. Até mesmo a Aliança Rebelde por vezes tinha de cometer atos que não os deixavam muito orgulhosos. Este robô não só ajudou a harmonizar o ambiente com o seu sentido de humor sarcástico como também a monotonia que por vezes se sentia. Não de uma forma penosa ou nada que se parecesse mas à medida que o filme progredia mais sentíamos o que podíamos esperar dele.<br><br>O terceiro ato foi um dos melhores que a saga oferece. Principalmente os últimos trinta minutos que foram uma (muitas!) explosão de ação com a narrativa dividida em três pontos principais. Todas as cenas prenderam ao ecrã e fizeram-me estar investido no filme. No final há uma sequência em particular que certamente irá entrar no pódio dos melhores momentos de toda a saga.

While the characters are very well put together and character development is solid the story is empty and somewhat confusing at times. Also let me stress this as much as I can if Star Wars does not have lightsabers than its not Star Wars., 3.0,  Smith T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977170552/, March 19 2018, N/A

 This movie had many flaws with pacing and it felt very slow at times and dragging on all of the scenes seemed cut together in no manner that felt like it benefited the story. The characters are not all too likable except brief character building moments that are cut short for a action sequence. All of the interesting story beats are not monopolized on and it seems that they focused too much on making a movie that gave you information and not a story. This entire movie is based on a single throw away line from a character in another Star Wars movie and it shows. The writing has many good moments and other terrible ones I enjoyed all of the acting especially that of Diego Luno who was a very good part of the movie unfortunately none of the characters sold the team aspect of the movie and only seemed like a bunch of stranger who ran into each other this theme was still present at the end of the film. I thought this was an okay film but the potential was wasted with many of the scenes there are many amazing moments but overall the film lacks a good story and character development in my opinion. This is still a very watchable film and you will find out very interesting things about the Star Wars universe you didn't know and some of them seem as if you didn't even ask but are given the answer anyway. You can tell the creators are real Star Wars fans though and it is very well made the visuals are stunning but it seems at times whole sequences were cut short and that parts of the movie just went missing on the cutting room floor which is very unfortunate for a promising film like this. You should still watch this film if you enjoy Star Wars movies though but I might say it's not for the average viewer but you might like it if you're into sci-fi., 2.5,  Josh K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/931853787/, March 16 2018, N/A
 This movie is somewhat difficult to get invested in for a while as the characters are hard to identify and aren't particularly fleshed out by the climax makes up for all of this.

 Very underwhelming knowing that it's a Star Wars film but is fun at time. K2SO is so much fun and Chirrut Imwe is a badass. The villain Krennec was very bland but the troopers were well designed and well utilized. Jones was okay as Jyn Erso but wasn't as heroic as I predicted.

 Enjoyable genre movie-making that answers the question "How did the rebels get the Death Star plans?" and thus serves as a prelude to Episode 4: A New Hope which most of us know to be just Star Wars (1977). Indeed we are treated to cameos by Princess Leia (young Carrie Fisher digitally) C3PO &amp R2D2 (briefly) and Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) as well as some guy in Peter Cushing make-up. (Jimmy Smits is here but I don't know why since I gave Episodes 2 and 3 a miss). The real focus here is on new characters however. It seems Mads Mikkelsen's Galen Erso designed the Death Star for the Empire under pressure even after they killed his wife and sent his daughter into hiding (with Forest Whitaker of the Rebels). As revenge he put "the flaw" into the machinery that the plans reveal. Years later his daughter Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) becomes convinced to get those Death Star plans along with Diego Luna Donnie Yen Wen Jiang Riz Ahmed and a deadpan robot named K-2SO. Aussie Ben Mendelsohn is the chief baddie (apart from D. V.). It's all action from start to finish with the typical Star Wars blend of smart-ass dialogue bonding and sentimentality and good vs. evil shoot-em-ups. There are attempts to create distinct characters but they are not much more than pieces on the chess board here totemic though some may be. In the end the film looks good (CGI) and director Gareth Edwards keeps things moving at a good pace (however like many films today it is probably a bit too long). Conclusion: if you like the franchise this is well worth your time., 3.5,  Art S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/792064900/, March 15 2018, N/A

 "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" was an exciting sci-fi film that added well to the saga particularly to the original Star Wars film. The well-blended action originality and nostalgia made this film fun to watch from beginning to end. The performances by the characters were solid. Ben Mendelsohn's portrayal of Orson Krennic was my favorite performance of the film. He was a very believable intense villain with a decent amount of depth. However despite how much I enjoyed this film it definitely wasn't perfect.<br><br>My first issue with the film was the music. This had nothing to do with the fact that there was no opening crawl I actually appreciated that. I just thought that the music was sub-par in comparison to the rest of the saga. Now I don't think that the music was totally deplorable it just seemed like amateur work at certain points (i.e. the beginning). I also had a hard time investing in the majority of the characters. My least favorite character was Saw Guerrera. I couldn't stand his voice and really couldn't take hime seriously at all. In fact I disliked the majority of the first act with the exception of the very beginning and all the action which was great and explained Jyn's origins. My least favorite part was the giant-octopus scene. That was just weird and made Saw look like a complete joke.<br><br>Thankfully this movie really picked up in the second and 3rd act and totally saved it for me. Despite the iffy CGI I loved Tarkin's role in the film and Vader's scenes we're awesome. The final space battles we're a blast and looked very real with the blend of CGI/practical effects. The drama of the film also picked up in the third act which actually had me invested in the characters unlike the first act.<br><br>Overall "Rogue One" was a great film that really added to the original Star Wars narrative. When I left the theater the first thing I wanted to do was watch the original Star Wars film which for me meant that this new film was a job well done!, 3.5,  Jacob W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/968029823/, March 13 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a solid action packed star wars movie worthy of its place in the Star wars universe with a great collection of rag tag crew led by Felicity Jones this movie pulls us. A motley crew up against a monumental task it is reminiscent of "The Bridge on the River Kwai" impossible mission movies. It also solves one of the longest problems in the star wars story the vulnerability of the death star it fills in a gap with a great deal of wonderful movie magic. its climatic end is as sad as it is satisfying and the ending scenes as well as a few others that add the character of darth vader teases the heck out of the question will we see more of Darth Vader in the future? There some bad CGI Tarken but CGI is used to great effect in the battle scenes. Rogue One shows that the Star Wars universe is growing up the message of this movie is sometimes heros die in a good cause Its a grown up message for a grown up Star Wars., 3.5,  Oliver G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976979342/, March 10 2018, N/A

 Rogue One é realizado por Garth Edwards e tem lugar entre o episódio III (2005) e IV (1974) da saga Star Wars (1974 -). O maior elogio que posso fazer a este filme é que me fez apreciar ainda mais o episódio IV da série e o mundo de Star Wars em geral.<br><br>Devo dizer que este é um filme dedicado aos fãs da saga mas que deve também agradar a quem não acompanha fielmente a sua história. Contudo de forma a apreciar na totalidade esta experiência recomendo que tenham algum conhecimento dos restantes filmes ou até da banda desenhada.<br><br>No episódio IV sabemos que a Aliança Rebelde tem posse dos planos da Estrela da Morte assim como o conhecimento de uma pequena falha no seu projeto mas nunca soubemos como até então.<br><br>Em The Force Awakens (2015) Daisy Ridley esteve brilhante enquanto Rey agora Felicity Jones que interpreta Jyn Erso vem demonstrar que também ela é uma grande adição às estrelas femininas deste universo assim como ao elenco em geral. Ao longo do filme Jyn é uma das poucas personagens que tem de facto uma progressão individual. Sim não existe uma intenção em aprofundar as personagens neste filme e às vezes torna-se necessário para conseguirmos estabelecer um sentimento de pertença das mesmas na história ainda assim deixei-me comover em certos momentos.<br><br>Não há como não me comover quando a banda sonora de Michael Giacchino atinge o seu auge com apenas quatro semanas para a compor. A música em Star Wars é sentida como se de uma personagem se tratasse e embora neste filme não existam muitas faixas de destaque a composição é eficiente. Dê-lhe mais tempo e certamente que em futuros projetos o som será mais refinado.<br><br>O antagonista Director Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) é um vilão com uma progressão interessante ficando progressivamente mais enfurecido. Tem uma missão para concretizar e quer ficar com os merecidos créditos é um patife agradável de assistir. Também Donnie Yen que interpreta Chirrut Îmwe um ex-guardião de um templo dos Jedi que está bastante ligado à Força apresenta-se como uma personagem de relevo não só ao filme como à mitologia de Star Wars em geral. É uma personagem única num universo surpreendente.<br><br>K-2SO o novo robô foi uma presença necessária neste filme de guerra. Tudo desde os cenários às expressões e falas das personagens indicavam um clima de tensão e irritabilidade. Até mesmo a Aliança Rebelde por vezes tinha de cometer atos que não os deixavam muito orgulhosos. Este robô não só ajudou a harmonizar o ambiente com o seu sentido de humor sarcástico como também a monotonia que por vezes se sentia. Não de uma forma penosa ou nada que se parecesse mas à medida que o filme progredia mais sentíamos o que podíamos esperar dele.<br><br>O terceiro ato foi um dos melhores que a saga oferece. Principalmente os últimos trinta minutos que foram uma (muitas!) explosão de ação com a narrativa dividida em três pontos principais. Todas as cenas prenderam ao ecrã e fizeram-me estar investido no filme. No final há uma sequência em particular que certamente irá entrar no pódio dos melhores momentos de toda a saga. É um final digno e apropriado para um dos meus filmes preferidos de Star Wars.<br><br>8/10, 4.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976856229/, March 10 2018, N/A
 The best Star Wars movie from a visual perspective. The story is good because it's gritty and actually tries to build credit with the audience. The biggest effect the movie has on the Star Wars universe is that it shows what the new trilogy (episodes 8 and 9) could have been instead of the mindless mess that they new trilogy has become. Apparently Disney can make a half-way decent Star Wars movie when they really want to. What a shame they've blown it with Episode 8 and particularly the disaster that was Episode 9., 4.0,  Mark S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977000071/, March 20 2018, N/A

This entire movie is based on a single throw away line from a character in another Star Wars movie and it shows. The writing has many good moments and other terrible ones I enjoyed all of the acting especially that of Diego Luno who was a very good part of the movie unfortunately none of the characters sold the team aspect of the movie and only seemed like a bunch of stranger who ran into each other this theme was still present at the end of the film. I thought this was an okay film but the potential was wasted with many of the scenes there are many amazing moments but overall the film lacks a good story and character development in my opinion. This is still a very watchable film and you will find out very interesting things about the Star Wars universe you didn't know and some of them seem as if you didn't even ask but are given the answer anyway. You can tell the creators are real Star Wars fans though and it is very well made the visuals are stunning but it seems at times whole sequences were cut short and that parts of the movie just went missing on the cutting room floor which is very unfortunate for a promising film like this. You should still watch this film if you enjoy Star Wars movies though but I might say it's not for the average viewer but you might like it if you're into sci-fi., 2.5,  Josh K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/931853787/, March 16 2018, N/A
 This movie is somewhat difficult to get invested in for a while as the characters are hard to identify and aren't particularly fleshed out by the climax makes up for all of this.

 Very underwhelming knowing that it's a Star Wars film but is fun at time. K2SO is so much fun and Chirrut Imwe is a badass. The villain Krennec was very bland but the troopers were well designed and well utilized. Jones was okay as Jyn Erso but wasn't as heroic as I predicted. Besides some fun action scenes Rogue One was a major disappointment and leaves me pessimistic looking at the future of the Star Wars side stories., 3.0,  A.J.

 Enjoyable genre movie-making that answers the question "How did the rebels get the Death Star plans?" and thus serves as a prelude to Episode 4: A New Hope which most of us know to be just Star Wars (1977). Indeed we are treated to cameos by Princess Leia (young Carrie Fisher digitally) C3PO &amp R2D2 (briefly) and Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) as well as some guy in Peter Cushing make-up. (Jimmy Smits is here but I don't know why since I gave Episodes 2 and 3 a miss). The real focus here is on new characters however. It seems Mads Mikkelsen's Galen Erso designed the Death Star for the Empire under pressure even after they killed his wife and sent his daughter into hiding (with Forest Whitaker of the Rebels). As revenge he put "the flaw" into the machinery that the plans reveal. Years later his daughter Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) becomes convinced to get those Death Star plans along with Diego Luna Donnie Yen Wen Jiang Riz Ahmed and a deadpan robot named K-2SO. Aussie Ben Mendelsohn is the chief baddie (apart from D. V.). It's all action from start to finish with the typical Star Wars blend of smart-ass dialogue bonding and sentimentality and good vs. evil shoot-em-ups. There are attempts to create distinct characters but they are not much more than pieces on the chess board here totemic though some may be. In the end the film looks good (CGI) and director Gareth Edwards keeps things moving at a good pace (however like many films today it is probably a bit too long). Conclusion: if you like the franchise this is well worth your time., 3.5,  Art S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/792064900/, March 15 2018, N/A

 "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" was an exciting sci-fi film that added well to the saga particularly to the original Star Wars film. The well-blended action originality and nostalgia made this film fun to watch from beginning to end. The performances by the characters were solid. Ben Mendelsohn's portrayal of Orson Krennic was my favorite performance of the film. He was a very believable intense villain with a decent amount of depth. However despite how much I enjoyed this film it definitely wasn't perfect.<br><br>My first issue with the film was the music. This had nothing to do with the fact that there was no opening crawl I actually appreciated that. I just thought that the music was sub-par in comparison to the rest of the saga. Now I don't think that the music was totally deplorable it just seemed like amateur work at certain points (i.e. the beginning). I also had a hard time investing in the majority of the characters. My least favorite character was Saw Guerrera. I couldn't stand his voice and really couldn't take hime seriously at all. In fact I disliked the majority of the first act with the exception of the very beginning and all the action which was great and explained Jyn's origins. My least favorite part was the giant-octopus scene. That was just weird and made Saw look like a complete joke.<br><br>Thankfully this movie really picked up in the second and 3rd act and totally saved it for me. Despite the iffy CGI I loved Tarkin's role in the film and Vader's scenes we're awesome. The final space battles we're a blast and looked very real with the blend of CGI/practical effects. The drama of the film also picked up in the third act which actually had me invested in the characters unlike the first act.<br><br>Overall "Rogue One" was a great film that really added to the original Star Wars narrative. When I left the theater the first thing I wanted to do was watch the original Star Wars film which for me meant that this new film was a job well done!, 3.5,  Jacob W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/968029823/, March 13 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a solid action packed star wars movie worthy of its place in the Star wars universe with a great collection of rag tag crew led by Felicity Jones this movie pulls us. A motley crew up against a monumental task it is reminiscent of "The Bridge on the River Kwai" impossible mission movies. It also solves one of the longest problems in the star wars story the vulnerability of the death star it fills in a gap with a great deal of wonderful movie magic. its climatic end is as sad as it is satisfying and the ending scenes as well as a few others that add the character of darth vader teases the heck out of the question will we see more of Darth Vader in the future? There some bad CGI Tarken but CGI is used to great effect in the battle scenes. Rogue One shows that the Star Wars universe is growing up the message of this movie is sometimes heros die in a good cause Its a grown up message for a grown up Star Wars., 3.5,  Oliver G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976979342/, March 10 2018, N/A

 Rogue One é realizado por Garth Edwards e tem lugar entre o episódio III (2005) e IV (1974) da saga Star Wars (1974 -). O maior elogio que posso fazer a este filme é que me fez apreciar ainda mais o episódio IV da série e o mundo de Star Wars em geral.<br><br>Devo dizer que este é um filme dedicado aos fãs da saga mas que deve também agradar a quem não acompanha fielmente a sua história. Contudo de forma a apreciar na totalidade esta experiência recomendo que tenham algum conhecimento dos restantes filmes ou até da banda desenhada.<br><br>No episódio IV sabemos que a Aliança Rebelde tem posse dos planos da Estrela da Morte assim como o conhecimento de uma pequena falha no seu projeto mas nunca soubemos como até então.<br><br>Em The Force Awakens (2015) Daisy Ridley esteve brilhante enquanto Rey agora Felicity Jones que interpreta Jyn Erso vem demonstrar que também ela é uma grande adição às estrelas femininas deste universo assim como ao elenco em geral. Ao longo do filme Jyn é uma das poucas personagens que tem de facto uma progressão individual. Sim não existe uma intenção em aprofundar as personagens neste filme e às vezes torna-se necessário para conseguirmos estabelecer um sentimento de pertença das mesmas na história ainda assim deixei-me comover em certos momentos.<br><br>Não há como não me comover quando a banda sonora de Michael Giacchino atinge o seu auge com apenas quatro semanas para a compor. A música em Star Wars é sentida como se de uma personagem se tratasse e embora neste filme não existam muitas faixas de destaque a composição é eficiente. Dê-lhe mais tempo e certamente que em futuros projetos o som será mais refinado.<br><br>O antagonista Director Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) é um vilão com uma progressão interessante ficando progressivamente mais enfurecido. Tem uma missão para concretizar e quer ficar com os merecidos créditos é um patife agradável de assistir. Também Donnie Yen que interpreta Chirrut Îmwe um ex-guardião de um templo dos Jedi que está bastante ligado à Força apresenta-se como uma personagem de relevo não só ao filme como à mitologia de Star Wars em geral. É uma personagem única num universo surpreendente.<br><br>K-2SO o novo robô foi uma presença necessária neste filme de guerra. Tudo desde os cenários às expressões e falas das personagens indicavam um clima de tensão e irritabilidade. Até mesmo a Aliança Rebelde por vezes tinha de cometer atos que não os deixavam muito orgulhosos. Este robô não só ajudou a harmonizar o ambiente com o seu sentido de humor sarcástico como também a monotonia que por vezes se sentia. Não de uma forma penosa ou nada que se parecesse mas à medida que o filme progredia mais sentíamos o que podíamos esperar dele.<br><br>O terceiro ato foi um dos melhores que a saga oferece. Principalmente os últimos trinta minutos que foram uma (muitas!) explosão de ação com a narrativa dividida em três pontos principais. Todas as cenas prenderam ao ecrã e fizeram-me estar investido no filme. No final há uma sequência em particular que certamente irá entrar no pódio dos melhores momentos de toda a saga. É um final digno e apropriado para um dos meus filmes preferidos de Star Wars.<br><br>8/10, 4.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976856229/, March 10 2018, N/A
 The best Star Wars movie from a visual perspective. The story is good because it's gritty and actually tries to build credit with the audience. The biggest effect the movie has on the Star Wars universe is that it shows what the new trilogy (episodes 8 and 9) could have been instead of the mindless mess that they new trilogy has become. Apparently Disney can make a half-way decent Star Wars movie when they really want to. What a shame they've blown it with Episode 8 and particularly the disaster that was Episode 9., 4.0,  Mark S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977000071/, March 20 2018, N/A

 Very underwhelming knowing that it's a Star Wars film but is fun at time. K2SO is so much fun and Chirrut Imwe is a badass. The villain Krennec was very bland but the troopers were well designed and well utilized. Jones was okay as Jyn Erso but wasn't as heroic as I predicted. Besides some fun action scenes Rogue One was a major disappointment and leaves me pessimistic looking at the future of the Star Wars side stories., 3.0,  A.J.

 Enjoyable genre movie-making that answers the question "How did the rebels get the Death Star plans?" and thus serves as a prelude to Episode 4: A New Hope which most of us know to be just Star Wars (1977). Indeed we are treated to cameos by Princess Leia (young Carrie Fisher digitally) C3PO &amp R2D2 (briefly) and Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) as well as some guy in Peter Cushing make-up. (Jimmy Smits is here but I don't know why since I gave Episodes 2 and 3 a miss). The real focus here is on new characters however. It seems Mads Mikkelsen's Galen Erso designed the Death Star for the Empire under pressure even after they killed his wife and sent his daughter into hiding (with Forest Whitaker of the Rebels). As revenge he put "the flaw" into the machinery that the plans reveal. Years later his daughter Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) becomes convinced to get those Death Star plans along with Diego Luna Donnie Yen Wen Jiang Riz Ahmed and a deadpan robot named K-2SO. Aussie Ben Mendelsohn is the chief baddie (apart from D. V.). It's all action from start to finish with the typical Star Wars blend of smart-ass dialogue bonding and sentimentality and good vs. evil shoot-em-ups. There are attempts to create distinct characters but they are not much more than pieces on the chess board here totemic though some may be. In the end the film looks good (CGI) and director Gareth Edwards keeps things moving at a good pace (however like many films today it is probably a bit too long). Conclusion: if you like the franchise this is well worth your time., 3.5,  Art S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/792064900/, March 15 2018, N/A

 "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" was an exciting sci-fi film that added well to the saga particularly to the original Star Wars film. The well-blended action originality and nostalgia made this film fun to watch from beginning to end. The performances by the characters were solid. Ben Mendelsohn's portrayal of Orson Krennic was my favorite performance of the film. He was a very believable intense villain with a decent amount of depth. However despite how much I enjoyed this film it definitely wasn't perfect.<br><br>My first issue with the film was the music. This had nothing to do with the fact that there was no opening crawl I actually appreciated that. I just thought that the music was sub-par in comparison to the rest of the saga. Now I don't think that the music was totally deplorable it just seemed like amateur work at certain points (i.e. the beginning). I also had a hard time investing in the majority of the characters. My least favorite character was Saw Guerrera. I couldn't stand his voice and really couldn't take hime seriously at all. In fact I disliked the majority of the first act with the exception of the very beginning and all the action which was great and explained Jyn's origins. My least favorite part was the giant-octopus scene. That was just weird and made Saw look like a complete joke.<br><br>Thankfully this movie really picked up in the second and 3rd act and totally saved it for me. Despite the iffy CGI I loved Tarkin's role in the film and Vader's scenes we're awesome. The final space battles we're a blast and looked very real with the blend of CGI/practical effects. The drama of the film also picked up in the third act which actually had me invested in the characters unlike the first act.<br><br>Overall "Rogue One" was a great film that really added to the original Star Wars narrative. When I left the theater the first thing I wanted to do was watch the original Star Wars film which for me meant that this new film was a job well done!, 3.5,  Jacob W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/968029823/, March 13 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a solid action packed star wars movie worthy of its place in the Star wars universe with a great collection of rag tag crew led by Felicity Jones this movie pulls us. A motley crew up against a monumental task it is reminiscent of "The Bridge on the River Kwai" impossible mission movies. It also solves one of the longest problems in the star wars story the vulnerability of the death star it fills in a gap with a great deal of wonderful movie magic. its climatic end is as sad as it is satisfying and the ending scenes as well as a few others that add the character of darth vader teases the heck out of the question will we see more of Darth Vader in the future? There some bad CGI Tarken but CGI is used to great effect in the battle scenes. Rogue One shows that the Star Wars universe is growing up the message of this movie is sometimes heros die in a good cause Its a grown up message for a grown up Star Wars., 3.5,  Oliver G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976979342/, March 10 2018, N/A

 Rogue One é realizado por Garth Edwards e tem lugar entre o episódio III (2005) e IV (1974) da saga Star Wars (1974 -). O maior elogio que posso fazer a este filme é que me fez apreciar ainda mais o episódio IV da série e o mundo de Star Wars em geral.<br><br>Devo dizer que este é um filme dedicado aos fãs da saga mas que deve também agradar a quem não acompanha fielmente a sua história. Contudo de forma a apreciar na totalidade esta experiência recomendo que tenham algum conhecimento dos restantes filmes ou até da banda desenhada.<br><br>No episódio IV sabemos que a Aliança Rebelde tem posse dos planos da Estrela da Morte assim como o conhecimento de uma pequena falha no seu projeto mas nunca soubemos como até então.<br><br>Em The Force Awakens (2015) Daisy Ridley esteve brilhante enquanto Rey agora Felicity Jones que interpreta Jyn Erso vem demonstrar que também ela é uma grande adição às estrelas femininas deste universo assim como ao elenco em geral. Ao longo do filme Jyn é uma das poucas personagens que tem de facto uma progressão individual. Sim não existe uma intenção em aprofundar as personagens neste filme e às vezes torna-se necessário para conseguirmos estabelecer um sentimento de pertença das mesmas na história ainda assim deixei-me comover em certos momentos.<br><br>Não há como não me comover quando a banda sonora de Michael Giacchino atinge o seu auge com apenas quatro semanas para a compor. A música em Star Wars é sentida como se de uma personagem se tratasse e embora neste filme não existam muitas faixas de destaque a composição é eficiente. Dê-lhe mais tempo e certamente que em futuros projetos o som será mais refinado.<br><br>O antagonista Director Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) é um vilão com uma progressão interessante ficando progressivamente mais enfurecido. Tem uma missão para concretizar e quer ficar com os merecidos créditos é um patife agradável de assistir. Também Donnie Yen que interpreta Chirrut Îmwe um ex-guardião de um templo dos Jedi que está bastante ligado à Força apresenta-se como uma personagem de relevo não só ao filme como à mitologia de Star Wars em geral. É uma personagem única num universo surpreendente.<br><br>K-2SO o novo robô foi uma presença necessária neste filme de guerra. Tudo desde os cenários às expressões e falas das personagens indicavam um clima de tensão e irritabilidade. Até mesmo a Aliança Rebelde por vezes tinha de cometer atos que não os deixavam muito orgulhosos. Este robô não só ajudou a harmonizar o ambiente com o seu sentido de humor sarcástico como também a monotonia que por vezes se sentia. Não de uma forma penosa ou nada que se parecesse mas à medida que o filme progredia mais sentíamos o que podíamos esperar dele.<br><br>O terceiro ato foi um dos melhores que a saga oferece. Principalmente os últimos trinta minutos que foram uma (muitas!) explosão de ação com a narrativa dividida em três pontos principais. Todas as cenas prenderam ao ecrã e fizeram-me estar investido no filme. No final há uma sequência em particular que certamente irá entrar no pódio dos melhores momentos de toda a saga. É um final digno e apropriado para um dos meus filmes preferidos de Star Wars.<br><br>8/10, 4.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976856229/, March 10 2018, N/A
 The best Star Wars movie from a visual perspective. The story is good because it's gritty and actually tries to build credit with the audience. The biggest effect the movie has on the Star Wars universe is that it shows what the new trilogy (episodes 8 and 9) could have been instead of the mindless mess that they new trilogy has become. Apparently Disney can make a half-way decent Star Wars movie when they really want to. What a shame they've blown it with Episode 8 and particularly the disaster that was Episode 9., 4.0,  Mark S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977000071/, March 20 2018, N/A

 This movie had many flaws with pacing and it felt very slow at times and dragging on all of the scenes seemed cut together in no manner that felt like it benefited the story. The characters are not all too likable except brief character building moments that are cut short for a action sequence. All of the interesting story beats are not monopolized on and it seems that they focused too much on making a movie that gave you information and not a story. This entire movie is based on a single throw away line from a character in another Star Wars movie and it shows. The writing has many good moments and other terrible ones I enjoyed all of the acting especially that of Diego Luno who was a very good part of the movie unfortunately none of the characters sold the team aspect of the movie and only seemed like a bunch of stranger who ran into each other this theme was still present at the end of the film. I thought this was an okay film but the potential was wasted with many of the scenes there are many amazing moments but overall the film lacks a good story and character development in my opinion. This is still a very watchable film and you will find out very interesting things about the Star Wars universe you didn't know and some of them seem as if you didn't even ask but are given the answer anyway. You can tell the creators are real Star Wars fans though and it is very well made the visuals are stunning but it seems at times whole sequences were cut short and that parts of the movie just went missing on the cutting room floor which is very unfortunate for a promising film like this. You should still watch this film if you enjoy Star Wars movies though but I might say it's not for the average viewer but you might like it if you're into sci-fi., 2.5,  Josh K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/931853787/, March 16 2018, N/A

 Enjoyable genre movie-making that answers the question "How did the rebels get the Death Star plans?" and thus serves as a prelude to Episode 4: A New Hope which most of us know to be just Star Wars (1977). Indeed we are treated to cameos by Princess Leia (young Carrie Fisher digitally) C3PO &amp R2D2 (briefly) and Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) as well as some guy in Peter Cushing make-up. (Jimmy Smits is here but I don't know why since I gave Episodes 2 and 3 a miss). The real focus here is on new characters however. It seems Mads Mikkelsen's Galen Erso designed the Death Star for the Empire under pressure even after they killed his wife and sent his daughter into hiding (with Forest Whitaker of the Rebels). As revenge he put "the flaw" into the machinery that the plans reveal. Years later his daughter Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) becomes convinced to get those Death Star plans along with Diego Luna Donnie Yen Wen Jiang Riz Ahmed and a deadpan robot named K-2SO. Aussie Ben Mendelsohn is the chief baddie (apart from D. V.). It's all action from start to finish with the typical Star Wars blend of smart-ass dialogue bonding and sentimentality and good vs. evil shoot-em-ups. There are attempts to create distinct characters but they are not much more than pieces on the chess board here totemic though some may be. In the end the film looks good (CGI) and director Gareth Edwards keeps things moving at a good pace (however like many films today it is probably a bit too long). Conclusion: if you like the franchise this is well worth your time., 3.5,  Art S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/792064900/, March 15 2018, N/A

 "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" was an exciting sci-fi film that added well to the saga particularly to the original Star Wars film. The well-blended action originality and nostalgia made this film fun to watch from beginning to end. The performances by the characters were solid. Ben Mendelsohn's portrayal of Orson Krennic was my favorite performance of the film. He was a very believable intense villain with a decent amount of depth. However despite how much I enjoyed this film it definitely wasn't perfect.<br><br>My first issue with the film was the music. This had nothing to do with the fact that there was no opening crawl I actually appreciated that. I just thought that the music was sub-par in comparison to the rest of the saga. Now I don't think that the music was totally deplorable it just seemed like amateur work at certain points (i.e. the beginning). I also had a hard time investing in the majority of the characters. My least favorite character was Saw Guerrera. I couldn't stand his voice and really couldn't take hime seriously at all. In fact I disliked the majority of the first act with the exception of the very beginning and all the action which was great and explained Jyn's origins. My least favorite part was the giant-octopus scene. That was just weird and made Saw look like a complete joke.<br><br>Thankfully this movie really picked up in the second and 3rd act and totally saved it for me. Despite the iffy CGI I loved Tarkin's role in the film and Vader's scenes we're awesome. The final space battles we're a blast and looked very real with the blend of CGI/practical effects. The drama of the film also picked up in the third act which actually had me invested in the characters unlike the first act.<br><br>Overall "Rogue One" was a great film that really added to the original Star Wars narrative. When I left the theater the first thing I wanted to do was watch the original Star Wars film which for me meant that this new film was a job well done!, 3.5,  Jacob W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/968029823/, March 13 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a solid action packed star wars movie worthy of its place in the Star wars universe with a great collection of rag tag crew led by Felicity Jones this movie pulls us. A motley crew up against a monumental task it is reminiscent of "The Bridge on the River Kwai" impossible mission movies. It also solves one of the longest problems in the star wars story the vulnerability of the death star it fills in a gap with a great deal of wonderful movie magic. its climatic end is as sad as it is satisfying and the ending scenes as well as a few others that add the character of darth vader teases the heck out of the question will we see more of Darth Vader in the future? There some bad CGI Tarken but CGI is used to great effect in the battle scenes. Rogue One shows that the Star Wars universe is growing up the message of this movie is sometimes heros die in a good cause Its a grown up message for a grown up Star Wars., 3.5,  Oliver G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976979342/, March 10 2018, N/A

 Rogue One é realizado por Garth Edwards e tem lugar entre o episódio III (2005) e IV (1974) da saga Star Wars (1974 -). O maior elogio que posso fazer a este filme é que me fez apreciar ainda mais o episódio IV da série e o mundo de Star Wars em geral.<br><br>Devo dizer que este é um filme dedicado aos fãs da saga mas que deve também agradar a quem não acompanha fielmente a sua história. Contudo de forma a apreciar na totalidade esta experiência recomendo que tenham algum conhecimento dos restantes filmes ou até da banda desenhada.<br><br>No episódio IV sabemos que a Aliança Rebelde tem posse dos planos da Estrela da Morte assim como o conhecimento de uma pequena falha no seu projeto mas nunca soubemos como até então.<br><br>Em The Force Awakens (2015) Daisy Ridley esteve brilhante enquanto Rey agora Felicity Jones que interpreta Jyn Erso vem demonstrar que também ela é uma grande adição às estrelas femininas deste universo assim como ao elenco em geral. Ao longo do filme Jyn é uma das poucas personagens que tem de facto uma progressão individual. Sim não existe uma intenção em aprofundar as personagens neste filme e às vezes torna-se necessário para conseguirmos estabelecer um sentimento de pertença das mesmas na história ainda assim deixei-me comover em certos momentos.<br><br>Não há como não me comover quando a banda sonora de Michael Giacchino atinge o seu auge com apenas quatro semanas para a compor. A música em Star Wars é sentida como se de uma personagem se tratasse e embora neste filme não existam muitas faixas de destaque a composição é eficiente. Dê-lhe mais tempo e certamente que em futuros projetos o som será mais refinado.<br><br>O antagonista Director Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) é um vilão com uma progressão interessante ficando progressivamente mais enfurecido. Tem uma missão para concretizar e quer ficar com os merecidos créditos é um patife agradável de assistir. Também Donnie Yen que interpreta Chirrut Îmwe um ex-guardião de um templo dos Jedi que está bastante ligado à Força apresenta-se como uma personagem de relevo não só ao filme como à mitologia de Star Wars em geral. É uma personagem única num universo surpreendente.<br><br>K-2SO o novo robô foi uma presença necessária neste filme de guerra. Tudo desde os cenários às expressões e falas das personagens indicavam um clima de tensão e irritabilidade. Até mesmo a Aliança Rebelde por vezes tinha de cometer atos que não os deixavam muito orgulhosos. Este robô não só ajudou a harmonizar o ambiente com o seu sentido de humor sarcástico como também a monotonia que por vezes se sentia. Não de uma forma penosa ou nada que se parecesse mas à medida que o filme progredia mais sentíamos o que podíamos esperar dele.<br><br>O terceiro ato foi um dos melhores que a saga oferece. Principalmente os últimos trinta minutos que foram uma (muitas!) explosão de ação com a narrativa dividida em três pontos principais. Todas as cenas prenderam ao ecrã e fizeram-me estar investido no filme. No final há uma sequência em particular que certamente irá entrar no pódio dos melhores momentos de toda a saga. É um final digno e apropriado para um dos meus filmes preferidos de Star Wars.<br><br>8/10, 4.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976856229/, March 10 2018, N/A
 The best Star Wars movie from a visual perspective. The story is good because it's gritty and actually tries to build credit with the audience. The biggest effect the movie has on the Star Wars universe is that it shows what the new trilogy (episodes 8 and 9) could have been instead of the mindless mess that they new trilogy has become. Apparently Disney can make a half-way decent Star Wars movie when they really want to. What a shame they've blown it with Episode 8 and particularly the disaster that was Episode 9., 4.0,  Mark S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977000071/, March 20 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a good spinoff. Originality is there acting is there and the visuals are there. The story itself though is kind of........ not.

 This movie had many flaws with pacing and it felt very slow at times and dragging on all of the scenes seemed cut together in no manner that felt like it benefited the story. The characters are not all too likable except brief character building moments that are cut short for a action sequence. All of the interesting story beats are not monopolized on and it seems that they focused too much on making a movie that gave you information and not a story. This entire movie is based on a single throw away line from a character in another Star Wars movie and it shows. The writing has many good moments and other terrible ones I enjoyed all of the acting especially that of Diego Luno who was a very good part of the movie unfortunately none of the characters sold the team aspect of the movie and only seemed like a bunch of stranger who ran into each other this theme was still present at the end of the film. I thought this was an okay film but the potential was wasted with many of the scenes there are many amazing moments but overall the film lacks a good story and character development in my opinion. This is still a very watchable film and you will find out very interesting things about the Star Wars universe you didn't know and some of them seem as if you didn't even ask but are given the answer anyway. You can tell the creators are real Star Wars fans though and it is very well made the visuals are stunning but it seems at times whole sequences were cut short and that parts of the movie just went missing on the cutting room floor which is very unfortunate for a promising film like this. You should still watch this film if you enjoy Star Wars movies though but I might say it's not for the average viewer but you might like it if you're into sci-fi., 2.5,  Josh K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/931853787/, March 16 2018, N/A

 Very underwhelming knowing that it's a Star Wars film but is fun at time. K2SO is so much fun and Chirrut Imwe is a badass.

 "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" was an exciting sci-fi film that added well to the saga particularly to the original Star Wars film. The well-blended action originality and nostalgia made this film fun to watch from beginning to end. The performances by the characters were solid. Ben Mendelsohn's portrayal of Orson Krennic was my favorite performance of the film. He was a very believable intense villain with a decent amount of depth. However despite how much I enjoyed this film it definitely wasn't perfect.<br><br>My first issue with the film was the music. This had nothing to do with the fact that there was no opening crawl I actually appreciated that. I just thought that the music was sub-par in comparison to the rest of the saga. Now I don't think that the music was totally deplorable it just seemed like amateur work at certain points (i.e. the beginning). I also had a hard time investing in the majority of the characters. My least favorite character was Saw Guerrera. I couldn't stand his voice and really couldn't take hime seriously at all. In fact I disliked the majority of the first act with the exception of the very beginning and all the action which was great and explained Jyn's origins. My least favorite part was the giant-octopus scene. That was just weird and made Saw look like a complete joke.<br><br>Thankfully this movie really picked up in the second and 3rd act and totally saved it for me. Despite the iffy CGI I loved Tarkin's role in the film and Vader's scenes we're awesome. The final space battles we're a blast and looked very real with the blend of CGI/practical effects. The drama of the film also picked up in the third act which actually had me invested in the characters unlike the first act.<br><br>Overall "Rogue One" was a great film that really added to the original Star Wars narrative. When I left the theater the first thing I wanted to do was watch the original Star Wars film which for me meant that this new film was a job well done!, 3.5,  Jacob W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/968029823/, March 13 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a solid action packed star wars movie worthy of its place in the Star wars universe with a great collection of rag tag crew led by Felicity Jones this movie pulls us. A motley crew up against a monumental task it is reminiscent of "The Bridge on the River Kwai" impossible mission movies. It also solves one of the longest problems in the star wars story the vulnerability of the death star it fills in a gap with a great deal of wonderful movie magic. its climatic end is as sad as it is satisfying and the ending scenes as well as a few others that add the character of darth vader teases the heck out of the question will we see more of Darth Vader in the future? There some bad CGI Tarken but CGI is used to great effect in the battle scenes. Rogue One shows that the Star Wars universe is growing up the message of this movie is sometimes heros die in a good cause Its a grown up message for a grown up Star Wars., 3.5,  Oliver G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976979342/, March 10 2018, N/A

 Rogue One é realizado por Garth Edwards e tem lugar entre o episódio III (2005) e IV (1974) da saga Star Wars (1974 -). O maior elogio que posso fazer a este filme é que me fez apreciar ainda mais o episódio IV da série e o mundo de Star Wars em geral.<br><br>Devo dizer que este é um filme dedicado aos fãs da saga mas que deve também agradar a quem não acompanha fielmente a sua história. Contudo de forma a apreciar na totalidade esta experiência recomendo que tenham algum conhecimento dos restantes filmes ou até da banda desenhada.<br><br>No episódio IV sabemos que a Aliança Rebelde tem posse dos planos da Estrela da Morte assim como o conhecimento de uma pequena falha no seu projeto mas nunca soubemos como até então.<br><br>Em The Force Awakens (2015) Daisy Ridley esteve brilhante enquanto Rey agora Felicity Jones que interpreta Jyn Erso vem demonstrar que também ela é uma grande adição às estrelas femininas deste universo assim como ao elenco em geral. Ao longo do filme Jyn é uma das poucas personagens que tem de facto uma progressão individual. Sim não existe uma intenção em aprofundar as personagens neste filme e às vezes torna-se necessário para conseguirmos estabelecer um sentimento de pertença das mesmas na história ainda assim deixei-me comover em certos momentos.<br><br>Não há como não me comover quando a banda sonora de Michael Giacchino atinge o seu auge com apenas quatro semanas para a compor. A música em Star Wars é sentida como se de uma personagem se tratasse e embora neste filme não existam muitas faixas de destaque a composição é eficiente. Dê-lhe mais tempo e certamente que em futuros projetos o som será mais refinado.<br><br>O antagonista Director Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) é um vilão com uma progressão interessante ficando progressivamente mais enfurecido. Tem uma missão para concretizar e quer ficar com os merecidos créditos é um patife agradável de assistir. Também Donnie Yen que interpreta Chirrut Îmwe um ex-guardião de um templo dos Jedi que está bastante ligado à Força apresenta-se como uma personagem de relevo não só ao filme como à mitologia de Star Wars em geral. É uma personagem única num universo surpreendente.<br><br>K-2SO o novo robô foi uma presença necessária neste filme de guerra. Tudo desde os cenários às expressões e falas das personagens indicavam um clima de tensão e irritabilidade. Até mesmo a Aliança Rebelde por vezes tinha de cometer atos que não os deixavam muito orgulhosos. Este robô não só ajudou a harmonizar o ambiente com o seu sentido de humor sarcástico como também a monotonia que por vezes se sentia. Não de uma forma penosa ou nada que se parecesse mas à medida que o filme progredia mais sentíamos o que podíamos esperar dele.<br><br>O terceiro ato foi um dos melhores que a saga oferece. Principalmente os últimos trinta minutos que foram uma (muitas!) explosão de ação com a narrativa dividida em três pontos principais. Todas as cenas prenderam ao ecrã e fizeram-me estar investido no filme. No final há uma sequência em particular que certamente irá entrar no pódio dos melhores momentos de toda a saga. É um final digno e apropriado para um dos meus filmes preferidos de Star Wars.<br><br>8/10, 4.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976856229/, March 10 2018, N/A
 The best Star Wars movie from a visual perspective. The story is good because it's gritty and actually tries to build credit with the audience. The biggest effect the movie has on the Star Wars universe is that it shows what the new trilogy (episodes 8 and 9) could have been instead of the mindless mess that they new trilogy has become. Apparently Disney can make a half-way decent Star Wars movie when they really want to. What a shame they've blown it with Episode 8 and particularly the disaster that was Episode 9., 4.0,  Mark S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977000071/, March 20 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a good spinoff. Originality is there acting is there and the visuals are there. The story itself though is kind of........ not. While the characters are very well put together and character development is solid the story is empty and somewhat confusing at times.

 This movie had many flaws with pacing and it felt very slow at times and dragging on all of the scenes seemed cut together in no manner that felt like it benefited the story. The characters are not all too likable except brief character building moments that are cut short for a action sequence. All of the interesting story beats are not monopolized on and it seems that they focused too much on making a movie that gave you information and not a story. This entire movie is based on a single throw away line from a character in another Star Wars movie and it shows. The writing has many good moments and other terrible ones I enjoyed all of the acting especially that of Diego Luno who was a very good part of the movie unfortunately none of the characters sold the team aspect of the movie and only seemed like a bunch of stranger who ran into each other this theme was still present at the end of the film. I thought this was an okay film but the potential was wasted with many of the scenes there are many amazing moments but overall the film lacks a good story and character development in my opinion. This is still a very watchable film and you will find out very interesting things about the Star Wars universe you didn't know and some of them seem as if you didn't even ask but are given the answer anyway. You can tell the creators are real Star Wars fans though and it is very well made the visuals are stunning but it seems at times whole sequences were cut short and that parts of the movie just went missing on the cutting room floor which is very unfortunate for a promising film like this. You should still watch this film if you enjoy Star Wars movies though but I might say it's not for the average viewer but you might like it if you're into sci-fi., 2.5,  Josh K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/931853787/, March 16 2018, N/A

 Very underwhelming knowing that it's a Star Wars film but is fun at time. K2SO is so much fun and Chirrut Imwe is a badass. The villain Krennec was very bland but the troopers were well designed and well utilized. Jones was okay as Jyn Erso but wasn't as heroic as I predicted. Besides some fun action scenes Rogue One was a major disappointment and leaves me pessimistic looking at the future of the Star Wars side stories., 3.0,  A.J.

 Enjoyable genre movie-making that answers the question "How did the rebels get the Death Star plans?" and thus serves as a prelude to Episode 4: A New Hope which most of us know to be just Star Wars (1977). Indeed we are treated to cameos by Princess Leia (young Carrie Fisher digitally) C3PO &amp R2D2 (briefly) and Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) as well as some guy in Peter Cushing make-up. (Jimmy Smits is here but I don't know why since I gave Episodes 2 and 3 a miss). The real focus here is on new characters however. It seems Mads Mikkelsen's Galen Erso designed the Death Star for the Empire under pressure even after they killed his wife and sent his daughter into hiding (with Forest Whitaker of the Rebels). As revenge he put "the flaw" into the machinery that the plans reveal. Years later his daughter Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) becomes convinced to get those Death Star plans along with Diego Luna Donnie Yen Wen Jiang Riz Ahmed and a deadpan robot named K-2SO. Aussie Ben Mendelsohn is the chief baddie (apart from D. V.). It's all action from start to finish with the typical Star Wars blend of smart-ass dialogue bonding and sentimentality and good vs. evil shoot-em-ups.

The well-blended action originality and nostalgia made this film fun to watch from beginning to end. The performances by the characters were solid. Ben Mendelsohn's portrayal of Orson Krennic was my favorite performance of the film. He was a very believable intense villain with a decent amount of depth. However despite how much I enjoyed this film it definitely wasn't perfect.<br><br>My first issue with the film was the music. This had nothing to do with the fact that there was no opening crawl I actually appreciated that. I just thought that the music was sub-par in comparison to the rest of the saga. Now I don't think that the music was totally deplorable it just seemed like amateur work at certain points (i.e. the beginning). I also had a hard time investing in the majority of the characters. My least favorite character was Saw Guerrera. I couldn't stand his voice and really couldn't take hime seriously at all. In fact I disliked the majority of the first act with the exception of the very beginning and all the action which was great and explained Jyn's origins. My least favorite part was the giant-octopus scene. That was just weird and made Saw look like a complete joke.<br><br>Thankfully this movie really picked up in the second and 3rd act and totally saved it for me. Despite the iffy CGI I loved Tarkin's role in the film and Vader's scenes we're awesome. The final space battles we're a blast and looked very real with the blend of CGI/practical effects. The drama of the film also picked up in the third act which actually had me invested in the characters unlike the first act.<br><br>Overall "Rogue One" was a great film that really added to the original Star Wars narrative. When I left the theater the first thing I wanted to do was watch the original Star Wars film which for me meant that this new film was a job well done!, 3.5,  Jacob W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/968029823/, March 13 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a solid action packed star wars movie worthy of its place in the Star wars universe with a great collection of rag tag crew led by Felicity Jones this movie pulls us. A motley crew up against a monumental task it is reminiscent of "The Bridge on the River Kwai" impossible mission movies. It also solves one of the longest problems in the star wars story the vulnerability of the death star it fills in a gap with a great deal of wonderful movie magic. its climatic end is as sad as it is satisfying and the ending scenes as well as a few others that add the character of darth vader teases the heck out of the question will we see more of Darth Vader in the future? There some bad CGI Tarken but CGI is used to great effect in the battle scenes. Rogue One shows that the Star Wars universe is growing up the message of this movie is sometimes heros die in a good cause Its a grown up message for a grown up Star Wars., 3.5,  Oliver G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976979342/, March 10 2018, N/A

 Rogue One é realizado por Garth Edwards e tem lugar entre o episódio III (2005) e IV (1974) da saga Star Wars (1974 -). O maior elogio que posso fazer a este filme é que me fez apreciar ainda mais o episódio IV da série e o mundo de Star Wars em geral.<br><br>Devo dizer que este é um filme dedicado aos fãs da saga mas que deve também agradar a quem não acompanha fielmente a sua história. Contudo de forma a apreciar na totalidade esta experiência recomendo que tenham algum conhecimento dos restantes filmes ou até da banda desenhada.<br><br>No episódio IV sabemos que a Aliança Rebelde tem posse dos planos da Estrela da Morte assim como o conhecimento de uma pequena falha no seu projeto mas nunca soubemos como até então.<br><br>Em The Force Awakens (2015) Daisy Ridley esteve brilhante enquanto Rey agora Felicity Jones que interpreta Jyn Erso vem demonstrar que também ela é uma grande adição às estrelas femininas deste universo assim como ao elenco em geral. Ao longo do filme Jyn é uma das poucas personagens que tem de facto uma progressão individual. Sim não existe uma intenção em aprofundar as personagens neste filme e às vezes torna-se necessário para conseguirmos estabelecer um sentimento de pertença das mesmas na história ainda assim deixei-me comover em certos momentos.<br><br>Não há como não me comover quando a banda sonora de Michael Giacchino atinge o seu auge com apenas quatro semanas para a compor. A música em Star Wars é sentida como se de uma personagem se tratasse e embora neste filme não existam muitas faixas de destaque a composição é eficiente. Dê-lhe mais tempo e certamente que em futuros projetos o som será mais refinado.<br><br>O antagonista Director Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) é um vilão com uma progressão interessante ficando progressivamente mais enfurecido. Tem uma missão para concretizar e quer ficar com os merecidos créditos é um patife agradável de assistir. Também Donnie Yen que interpreta Chirrut Îmwe um ex-guardião de um templo dos Jedi que está bastante ligado à Força apresenta-se como uma personagem de relevo não só ao filme como à mitologia de Star Wars em geral. É uma personagem única num universo surpreendente.<br><br>K-2SO o novo robô foi uma presença necessária neste filme de guerra. Tudo desde os cenários às expressões e falas das personagens indicavam um clima de tensão e irritabilidade. Até mesmo a Aliança Rebelde por vezes tinha de cometer atos que não os deixavam muito orgulhosos. Este robô não só ajudou a harmonizar o ambiente com o seu sentido de humor sarcástico como também a monotonia que por vezes se sentia. Não de uma forma penosa ou nada que se parecesse mas à medida que o filme progredia mais sentíamos o que podíamos esperar dele.<br><br>O terceiro ato foi um dos melhores que a saga oferece. Principalmente os últimos trinta minutos que foram uma (muitas!) explosão de ação com a narrativa dividida em três pontos principais. Todas as cenas prenderam ao ecrã e fizeram-me estar investido no filme. No final há uma sequência em particular que certamente irá entrar no pódio dos melhores momentos de toda a saga. É um final digno e apropriado para um dos meus filmes preferidos de Star Wars.<br><br>8/10, 4.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976856229/, March 10 2018, N/A
 The best Star Wars movie from a visual perspective. The story is good because it's gritty and actually tries to build credit with the audience. The biggest effect the movie has on the Star Wars universe is that it shows what the new trilogy (episodes 8 and 9) could have been instead of the mindless mess that they new trilogy has become. Apparently Disney can make a half-way decent Star Wars movie when they really want to. What a shame they've blown it with Episode 8 and particularly the disaster that was Episode 9., 4.0,  Mark S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977000071/, March 20 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a good spinoff. Originality is there acting is there and the visuals are there. The story itself though is kind of........ not. While the characters are very well put together and character development is solid the story is empty and somewhat confusing at times. Also let me stress this as much as I can if Star Wars does not have lightsabers than its not Star Wars., 3.0,  Smith T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977170552/, March 19 2018, N/A

 Despite being very fond of the original Star Wars trilogy I've always been more of a Star Trek fan than Star Wars and the recent Star Wars movies have only served to reinforce my preference and left me uninterested This movie however gets 10/10 and were all the Star Wars movies as good as this would certainly change the balance of the preference force., 5.0,  James C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/937277817/, March 17 2018, N/A
 This movie had many flaws with pacing and it felt very slow at times and dragging on all of the scenes seemed cut together in no manner that felt like it benefited the story. The characters are not all too likable except brief character building moments that are cut short for a action sequence. All of the interesting story beats are not monopolized on and it seems that they focused too much on making a movie that gave you information and not a story. This entire movie is based on a single throw away line from a character in another Star Wars movie and it shows. The writing has many good moments and other terrible ones I enjoyed all of the acting especially that of Diego Luno who was a very good part of the movie unfortunately none of the characters sold the team aspect of the movie and only seemed like a bunch of stranger who ran into each other this theme was still present at the end of the film. I thought this was an okay film but the potential was wasted with many of the scenes there are many amazing moments but overall the film lacks a good story and character development in my opinion. This is still a very watchable film and you will find out very interesting things about the Star Wars universe you didn't know and some of them seem as if you didn't even ask but are given the answer anyway. You can tell the creators are real Star Wars fans though and it is very well made the visuals are stunning but it seems at times whole sequences were cut short and that parts of the movie just went missing on the cutting room floor which is very unfortunate for a promising film like this. You should still watch this film if you enjoy Star Wars movies though but I might say it's not for the average viewer but you might like it if you're into sci-fi., 2.5,  Josh K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/931853787/, March 16 2018, N/A

 Very underwhelming knowing that it's a Star Wars film but is fun at time. K2SO is so much fun and Chirrut Imwe is a badass. The villain Krennec was very bland but the troopers were well designed and well utilized. Jones was okay as Jyn Erso but wasn't as heroic as I predicted. Besides some fun action scenes Rogue One was a major disappointment and leaves me pessimistic looking at the future of the Star Wars side stories., 3.0,  A.J.

 Enjoyable genre movie-making that answers the question "How did the rebels get the Death Star plans?" and thus serves as a prelude to Episode 4: A New Hope which most of us know to be just Star Wars (1977). Indeed we are treated to cameos by Princess Leia (young Carrie Fisher digitally) C3PO &amp R2D2 (briefly) and Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) as well as some guy in Peter Cushing make-up. (Jimmy Smits is here but I don't know why since I gave Episodes 2 and 3 a miss). The real focus here is on new characters however. It seems Mads Mikkelsen's Galen Erso designed the Death Star for the Empire under pressure even after they killed his wife and sent his daughter into hiding (with Forest Whitaker of the Rebels). As revenge he put "the flaw" into the machinery that the plans reveal. Years later his daughter Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) becomes convinced to get those Death Star plans along with Diego Luna Donnie Yen Wen Jiang Riz Ahmed and a deadpan robot named K-2SO. Aussie Ben Mendelsohn is the chief baddie (apart from D. V.). It's all action from start to finish with the typical Star Wars blend of smart-ass dialogue bonding and sentimentality and good vs. evil shoot-em-ups. There are attempts to create distinct characters but they are not much more than pieces on the chess board here totemic though some may be. In the end the film looks good (CGI) and director Gareth Edwards keeps things moving at a good pace (however like many films today it is probably a bit too long). Conclusion: if you like the franchise this is well worth your time., 3.5,  Art S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/792064900/, March 15 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a solid action packed star wars movie worthy of its place in the Star wars universe with a great collection of rag tag crew led by Felicity Jones this movie pulls us. A motley crew up against a monumental task it is reminiscent of "The Bridge on the River Kwai" impossible mission movies. It also solves one of the longest problems in the star wars story the vulnerability of the death star it fills in a gap with a great deal of wonderful movie magic. its climatic end is as sad as it is satisfying and the ending scenes as well as a few others that add the character of darth vader teases the heck out of the question will we see more of Darth Vader in the future? There some bad CGI Tarken but CGI is used to great effect in the battle scenes. Rogue One shows that the Star Wars universe is growing up the message of this movie is sometimes heros die in a good cause Its a grown up message for a grown up Star Wars., 3.5,  Oliver G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976979342/, March 10 2018, N/A

 Rogue One é realizado por Garth Edwards e tem lugar entre o episódio III (2005) e IV (1974) da saga Star Wars (1974 -). O maior elogio que posso fazer a este filme é que me fez apreciar ainda mais o episódio IV da série e o mundo de Star Wars em geral.<br><br>Devo dizer que este é um filme dedicado aos fãs da saga mas que deve também agradar a quem não acompanha fielmente a sua história. Contudo de forma a apreciar na totalidade esta experiência recomendo que tenham algum conhecimento dos restantes filmes ou até da banda desenhada.<br><br>No episódio IV sabemos que a Aliança Rebelde tem posse dos planos da Estrela da Morte assim como o conhecimento de uma pequena falha no seu projeto mas nunca soubemos como até então.<br><br>Em The Force Awakens (2015) Daisy Ridley esteve brilhante enquanto Rey agora Felicity Jones que interpreta Jyn Erso vem demonstrar que também ela é uma grande adição às estrelas femininas deste universo assim como ao elenco em geral. Ao longo do filme Jyn é uma das poucas personagens que tem de facto uma progressão individual. Sim não existe uma intenção em aprofundar as personagens neste filme e às vezes torna-se necessário para conseguirmos estabelecer um sentimento de pertença das mesmas na história ainda assim deixei-me comover em certos momentos.<br><br>Não há como não me comover quando a banda sonora de Michael Giacchino atinge o seu auge com apenas quatro semanas para a compor. A música em Star Wars é sentida como se de uma personagem se tratasse e embora neste filme não existam muitas faixas de destaque a composição é eficiente. Dê-lhe mais tempo e certamente que em futuros projetos o som será mais refinado.<br><br>O antagonista Director Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) é um vilão com uma progressão interessante ficando progressivamente mais enfurecido. Tem uma missão para concretizar e quer ficar com os merecidos créditos é um patife agradável de assistir. Também Donnie Yen que interpreta Chirrut Îmwe um ex-guardião de um templo dos Jedi que está bastante ligado à Força apresenta-se como uma personagem de relevo não só ao filme como à mitologia de Star Wars em geral. É uma personagem única num universo surpreendente.<br><br>K-2SO o novo robô foi uma presença necessária neste filme de guerra. Tudo desde os cenários às expressões e falas das personagens indicavam um clima de tensão e irritabilidade. Até mesmo a Aliança Rebelde por vezes tinha de cometer atos que não os deixavam muito orgulhosos. Este robô não só ajudou a harmonizar o ambiente com o seu sentido de humor sarcástico como também a monotonia que por vezes se sentia. Não de uma forma penosa ou nada que se parecesse mas à medida que o filme progredia mais sentíamos o que podíamos esperar dele.<br><br>O terceiro ato foi um dos melhores que a saga oferece. Principalmente os últimos trinta minutos que foram uma (muitas!) explosão de ação com a narrativa dividida em três pontos principais. Todas as cenas prenderam ao ecrã e fizeram-me estar investido no filme. No final há uma sequência em particular que certamente irá entrar no pódio dos melhores momentos de toda a saga. É um final digno e apropriado para um dos meus filmes preferidos de Star Wars.<br><br>8/10, 4.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976856229/, March 10 2018, N/A
 The best Star Wars movie from a visual perspective. The story is good because it's gritty and actually tries to build credit with the audience. The biggest effect the movie has on the Star Wars universe is that it shows what the new trilogy (episodes 8 and 9) could have been instead of the mindless mess that they new trilogy has become. Apparently Disney can make a half-way decent Star Wars movie when they really want to. What a shame they've blown it with Episode 8 and particularly the disaster that was Episode 9., 4.0,  Mark S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977000071/, March 20 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a good spinoff. Originality is there acting is there and the visuals are there. The story itself though is kind of........ not. While the characters are very well put together and character development is solid the story is empty and somewhat confusing at times.

 Despite being very fond of the original Star Wars trilogy I've always been more of a Star Trek fan than Star Wars and the recent Star Wars movies have only served to reinforce my preference and left me uninterested This movie however gets 10/10 and were all the Star Wars movies as good as this would certainly change the balance of the preference force., 5.0,  James C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/937277817/, March 17 2018, N/A
 This movie had many flaws with pacing and it felt very slow at times and dragging on all of the scenes seemed cut together in no manner that felt like it benefited the story. The characters are not all too likable except brief character building moments that are cut short for a action sequence. All of the interesting story beats are not monopolized on and it seems that they focused too much on making a movie that gave you information and not a story. This entire movie is based on a single throw away line from a character in another Star Wars movie and it shows. The writing has many good moments and other terrible ones I enjoyed all of the acting especially that of Diego Luno who was a very good part of the movie unfortunately none of the characters sold the team aspect of the movie and only seemed like a bunch of stranger who ran into each other this theme was still present at the end of the film. I thought this was an okay film but the potential was wasted with many of the scenes there are many amazing moments but overall the film lacks a good story and character development in my opinion. This is still a very watchable film and you will find out very interesting things about the Star Wars universe you didn't know and some of them seem as if you didn't even ask but are given the answer anyway. You can tell the creators are real Star Wars fans though and it is very well made the visuals are stunning but it seems at times whole sequences were cut short and that parts of the movie just went missing on the cutting room floor which is very unfortunate for a promising film like this. You should still watch this film if you enjoy Star Wars movies though but I might say it's not for the average viewer but you might like it if you're into sci-fi., 2.5,  Josh K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/931853787/, March 16 2018, N/A

 Very underwhelming knowing that it's a Star Wars film but is fun at time. K2SO is so much fun and Chirrut Imwe is a badass. The villain Krennec was very bland but the troopers were well designed and well utilized. Jones was okay as Jyn Erso but wasn't as heroic as I predicted. Besides some fun action scenes Rogue One was a major disappointment and leaves me pessimistic looking at the future of the Star Wars side stories., 3.0,  A.J.

 Enjoyable genre movie-making that answers the question "How did the rebels get the Death Star plans?" and thus serves as a prelude to Episode 4: A New Hope which most of us know to be just Star Wars (1977). Indeed we are treated to cameos by Princess Leia (young Carrie Fisher digitally) C3PO &amp R2D2 (briefly) and Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) as well as some guy in Peter Cushing make-up. (Jimmy Smits is here but I don't know why since I gave Episodes 2 and 3 a miss). The real focus here is on new characters however. It seems Mads Mikkelsen's Galen Erso designed the Death Star for the Empire under pressure even after they killed his wife and sent his daughter into hiding (with Forest Whitaker of the Rebels). As revenge he put "the flaw" into the machinery that the plans reveal. Years later his daughter Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) becomes convinced to get those Death Star plans along with Diego Luna Donnie Yen Wen Jiang Riz Ahmed and a deadpan robot named K-2SO. Aussie Ben Mendelsohn is the chief baddie (apart from D. V.). It's all action from start to finish with the typical Star Wars blend of smart-ass dialogue bonding and sentimentality and good vs. evil shoot-em-ups. There are attempts to create distinct characters but they are not much more than pieces on the chess board here totemic though some may be. In the end the film looks good (CGI) and director Gareth Edwards keeps things moving at a good pace (however like many films today it is probably a bit too long). Conclusion: if you like the franchise this is well worth your time., 3.5,  Art S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/792064900/, March 15 2018, N/A

 "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" was an exciting sci-fi film that added well to the saga particularly to the original Star Wars film. The well-blended action originality and nostalgia made this film fun to watch from beginning to end. The performances by the characters were solid. Ben Mendelsohn's portrayal of Orson Krennic was my favorite performance of the film. He was a very believable intense villain with a decent amount of depth. However despite how much I enjoyed this film it definitely wasn't perfect.<br><br>My first issue with the film was the music. This had nothing to do with the fact that there was no opening crawl I actually appreciated that. I just thought that the music was sub-par in comparison to the rest of the saga. Now I don't think that the music was totally deplorable it just seemed like amateur work at certain points (i.e. the beginning). I also had a hard time investing in the majority of the characters. My least favorite character was Saw Guerrera. I couldn't stand his voice and really couldn't take hime seriously at all. In fact I disliked the majority of the first act with the exception of the very beginning and all the action which was great and explained Jyn's origins. My least favorite part was the giant-octopus scene. That was just weird and made Saw look like a complete joke.<br><br>Thankfully this movie really picked up in the second and 3rd act and totally saved it for me.

Rogue One shows that the Star Wars universe is growing up the message of this movie is sometimes heros die in a good cause Its a grown up message for a grown up Star Wars., 3.5,  Oliver G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976979342/, March 10 2018, N/A

 Rogue One é realizado por Garth Edwards e tem lugar entre o episódio III (2005) e IV (1974) da saga Star Wars (1974 -). O maior elogio que posso fazer a este filme é que me fez apreciar ainda mais o episódio IV da série e o mundo de Star Wars em geral.<br><br>Devo dizer que este é um filme dedicado aos fãs da saga mas que deve também agradar a quem não acompanha fielmente a sua história. Contudo de forma a apreciar na totalidade esta experiência recomendo que tenham algum conhecimento dos restantes filmes ou até da banda desenhada.<br><br>No episódio IV sabemos que a Aliança Rebelde tem posse dos planos da Estrela da Morte assim como o conhecimento de uma pequena falha no seu projeto mas nunca soubemos como até então.<br><br>Em The Force Awakens (2015) Daisy Ridley esteve brilhante enquanto Rey agora Felicity Jones que interpreta Jyn Erso vem demonstrar que também ela é uma grande adição às estrelas femininas deste universo assim como ao elenco em geral. Ao longo do filme Jyn é uma das poucas personagens que tem de facto uma progressão individual. Sim não existe uma intenção em aprofundar as personagens neste filme e às vezes torna-se necessário para conseguirmos estabelecer um sentimento de pertença das mesmas na história ainda assim deixei-me comover em certos momentos.<br><br>Não há como não me comover quando a banda sonora de Michael Giacchino atinge o seu auge com apenas quatro semanas para a compor. A música em Star Wars é sentida como se de uma personagem se tratasse e embora neste filme não existam muitas faixas de destaque a composição é eficiente. Dê-lhe mais tempo e certamente que em futuros projetos o som será mais refinado.<br><br>O antagonista Director Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) é um vilão com uma progressão interessante ficando progressivamente mais enfurecido. Tem uma missão para concretizar e quer ficar com os merecidos créditos é um patife agradável de assistir. Também Donnie Yen que interpreta Chirrut Îmwe um ex-guardião de um templo dos Jedi que está bastante ligado à Força apresenta-se como uma personagem de relevo não só ao filme como à mitologia de Star Wars em geral. É uma personagem única num universo surpreendente.<br><br>K-2SO o novo robô foi uma presença necessária neste filme de guerra. Tudo desde os cenários às expressões e falas das personagens indicavam um clima de tensão e irritabilidade. Até mesmo a Aliança Rebelde por vezes tinha de cometer atos que não os deixavam muito orgulhosos. Este robô não só ajudou a harmonizar o ambiente com o seu sentido de humor sarcástico como também a monotonia que por vezes se sentia. Não de uma forma penosa ou nada que se parecesse mas à medida que o filme progredia mais sentíamos o que podíamos esperar dele.<br><br>O terceiro ato foi um dos melhores que a saga oferece. Principalmente os últimos trinta minutos que foram uma (muitas!) explosão de ação com a narrativa dividida em três pontos principais. Todas as cenas prenderam ao ecrã e fizeram-me estar investido no filme. No final há uma sequência em particular que certamente irá entrar no pódio dos melhores momentos de toda a saga. É um final digno e apropriado para um dos meus filmes preferidos de Star Wars.<br><br>8/10, 4.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976856229/, March 10 2018, N/A
 The best Star Wars movie from a visual perspective. The story is good because it's gritty and actually tries to build credit with the audience. The biggest effect the movie has on the Star Wars universe is that it shows what the new trilogy (episodes 8 and 9) could have been instead of the mindless mess that they new trilogy has become. Apparently Disney can make a half-way decent Star Wars movie when they really want to. What a shame they've blown it with Episode 8 and particularly the disaster that was Episode 9., 4.0,  Mark S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977000071/, March 20 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a good spinoff. Originality is there acting is there and the visuals are there. The story itself though is kind of........ not. While the characters are very well put together and character development is solid the story is empty and somewhat confusing at times.

 Despite being very fond of the original Star Wars trilogy I've always been more of a Star Trek fan than Star Wars and the recent Star Wars movies have only served to reinforce my preference and left me uninterested This movie however gets 10/10 and were all the Star Wars movies as good as this would certainly change the balance of the preference force., 5.0,  James C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/937277817/, March 17 2018, N/A
 This movie had many flaws with pacing and it felt very slow at times and dragging on all of the scenes seemed cut together in no manner that felt like it benefited the story. The characters are not all too likable except brief character building moments that are cut short for a action sequence. All of the interesting story beats are not monopolized on and it seems that they focused too much on making a movie that gave you information and not a story. This entire movie is based on a single throw away line from a character in another Star Wars movie and it shows. The writing has many good moments and other terrible ones I enjoyed all of the acting especially that of Diego Luno who was a very good part of the movie unfortunately none of the characters sold the team aspect of the movie and only seemed like a bunch of stranger who ran into each other this theme was still present at the end of the film. I thought this was an okay film but the potential was wasted with many of the scenes there are many amazing moments but overall the film lacks a good story and character development in my opinion. This is still a very watchable film and you will find out very interesting things about the Star Wars universe you didn't know and some of them seem as if you didn't even ask but are given the answer anyway. You can tell the creators are real Star Wars fans though and it is very well made the visuals are stunning but it seems at times whole sequences were cut short and that parts of the movie just went missing on the cutting room floor which is very unfortunate for a promising film like this. You should still watch this film if you enjoy Star Wars movies though but I might say it's not for the average viewer but you might like it if you're into sci-fi., 2.5,  Josh K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/931853787/, March 16 2018, N/A

 Very underwhelming knowing that it's a Star Wars film but is fun at time. K2SO is so much fun and Chirrut Imwe is a badass. The villain Krennec was very bland but the troopers were well designed and well utilized. Jones was okay as Jyn Erso but wasn't as heroic as I predicted. Besides some fun action scenes Rogue One was a major disappointment and leaves me pessimistic looking at the future of the Star Wars side stories., 3.0,  A.J.

 Enjoyable genre movie-making that answers the question "How did the rebels get the Death Star plans?" and thus serves as a prelude to Episode 4: A New Hope which most of us know to be just Star Wars (1977). Indeed we are treated to cameos by Princess Leia (young Carrie Fisher digitally) C3PO &amp R2D2 (briefly) and Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) as well as some guy in Peter Cushing make-up. (Jimmy Smits is here but I don't know why since I gave Episodes 2 and 3 a miss). The real focus here is on new characters however. It seems Mads Mikkelsen's Galen Erso designed the Death Star for the Empire under pressure even after they killed his wife and sent his daughter into hiding (with Forest Whitaker of the Rebels). As revenge he put "the flaw" into the machinery that the plans reveal. Years later his daughter Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) becomes convinced to get those Death Star plans along with Diego Luna Donnie Yen Wen Jiang Riz Ahmed and a deadpan robot named K-2SO. Aussie Ben Mendelsohn is the chief baddie (apart from D. V.). It's all action from start to finish with the typical Star Wars blend of smart-ass dialogue bonding and sentimentality and good vs. evil shoot-em-ups. There are attempts to create distinct characters but they are not much more than pieces on the chess board here totemic though some may be. In the end the film looks good (CGI) and director Gareth Edwards keeps things moving at a good pace (however like many films today it is probably a bit too long). Conclusion: if you like the franchise this is well worth your time., 3.5,  Art S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/792064900/, March 15 2018, N/A

 "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" was an exciting sci-fi film that added well to the saga particularly to the original Star Wars film. The well-blended action originality and nostalgia made this film fun to watch from beginning to end. The performances by the characters were solid. Ben Mendelsohn's portrayal of Orson Krennic was my favorite performance of the film. He was a very believable intense villain with a decent amount of depth. However despite how much I enjoyed this film it definitely wasn't perfect.<br><br>My first issue with the film was the music. This had nothing to do with the fact that there was no opening crawl I actually appreciated that. I just thought that the music was sub-par in comparison to the rest of the saga. Now I don't think that the music was totally deplorable it just seemed like amateur work at certain points (i.e. the beginning). I also had a hard time investing in the majority of the characters. My least favorite character was Saw Guerrera. I couldn't stand his voice and really couldn't take hime seriously at all. In fact I disliked the majority of the first act with the exception of the very beginning and all the action which was great and explained Jyn's origins. My least favorite part was the giant-octopus scene. That was just weird and made Saw look like a complete joke.<br><br>Thankfully this movie really picked up in the second and 3rd act and totally saved it for me. Despite the iffy CGI I loved Tarkin's role in the film and Vader's scenes we're awesome. The final space battles we're a blast and looked very real with the blend of CGI/practical effects. The drama of the film also picked up in the third act which actually had me invested in the characters unlike the first act.<br><br>Overall "Rogue One" was a great film that really added to the original Star Wars narrative. When I left the theater the first thing I wanted to do was watch the original Star Wars film which for me meant that this new film was a job well done!, 3.5,  Jacob W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/968029823/, March 13 2018, N/A

Contudo de forma a apreciar na totalidade esta experiência recomendo que tenham algum conhecimento dos restantes filmes ou até da banda desenhada.<br><br>No episódio IV sabemos que a Aliança Rebelde tem posse dos planos da Estrela da Morte assim como o conhecimento de uma pequena falha no seu projeto mas nunca soubemos como até então.<br><br>Em The Force Awakens (2015) Daisy Ridley esteve brilhante enquanto Rey agora Felicity Jones que interpreta Jyn Erso vem demonstrar que também ela é uma grande adição às estrelas femininas deste universo assim como ao elenco em geral. Ao longo do filme Jyn é uma das poucas personagens que tem de facto uma progressão individual. Sim não existe uma intenção em aprofundar as personagens neste filme e às vezes torna-se necessário para conseguirmos estabelecer um sentimento de pertença das mesmas na história ainda assim deixei-me comover em certos momentos.<br><br>Não há como não me comover quando a banda sonora de Michael Giacchino atinge o seu auge com apenas quatro semanas para a compor. A música em Star Wars é sentida como se de uma personagem se tratasse e embora neste filme não existam muitas faixas de destaque a composição é eficiente. Dê-lhe mais tempo e certamente que em futuros projetos o som será mais refinado.<br><br>O antagonista Director Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) é um vilão com uma progressão interessante ficando progressivamente mais enfurecido. Tem uma missão para concretizar e quer ficar com os merecidos créditos é um patife agradável de assistir. Também Donnie Yen que interpreta Chirrut Îmwe um ex-guardião de um templo dos Jedi que está bastante ligado à Força apresenta-se como uma personagem de relevo não só ao filme como à mitologia de Star Wars em geral. É uma personagem única num universo surpreendente.<br><br>K-2SO o novo robô foi uma presença necessária neste filme de guerra. Tudo desde os cenários às expressões e falas das personagens indicavam um clima de tensão e irritabilidade. Até mesmo a Aliança Rebelde por vezes tinha de cometer atos que não os deixavam muito orgulhosos. Este robô não só ajudou a harmonizar o ambiente com o seu sentido de humor sarcástico como também a monotonia que por vezes se sentia. Não de uma forma penosa ou nada que se parecesse mas à medida que o filme progredia mais sentíamos o que podíamos esperar dele.<br><br>O terceiro ato foi um dos melhores que a saga oferece. Principalmente os últimos trinta minutos que foram uma (muitas!) explosão de ação com a narrativa dividida em três pontos principais. Todas as cenas prenderam ao ecrã e fizeram-me estar investido no filme. No final há uma sequência em particular que certamente irá entrar no pódio dos melhores momentos de toda a saga. É um final digno e apropriado para um dos meus filmes preferidos de Star Wars.<br><br>8/10, 4.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976856229/, March 10 2018, N/A
 The best Star Wars movie from a visual perspective. The story is good because it's gritty and actually tries to build credit with the audience. The biggest effect the movie has on the Star Wars universe is that it shows what the new trilogy (episodes 8 and 9) could have been instead of the mindless mess that they new trilogy has become. Apparently Disney can make a half-way decent Star Wars movie when they really want to. What a shame they've blown it with Episode 8 and particularly the disaster that was Episode 9., 4.0,  Mark S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977000071/, March 20 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a good spinoff. Originality is there acting is there and the visuals are there. The story itself though is kind of........ not. While the characters are very well put together and character development is solid the story is empty and somewhat confusing at times. Also let me stress this as much as I can if Star Wars does not have lightsabers than its not Star Wars., 3.0,  Smith T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977170552/, March 19 2018, N/A

 Despite being very fond of the original Star Wars trilogy I've always been more of a Star Trek fan than Star Wars and the recent Star Wars movies have only served to reinforce my preference and left me uninterested This movie however gets 10/10 and were all the Star Wars movies as good as this would certainly change the balance of the preference force., 5.0,  James C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/937277817/, March 17 2018, N/A
 This movie had many flaws with pacing and it felt very slow at times and dragging on all of the scenes seemed cut together in no manner that felt like it benefited the story. The characters are not all too likable except brief character building moments that are cut short for a action sequence. All of the interesting story beats are not monopolized on and it seems that they focused too much on making a movie that gave you information and not a story. This entire movie is based on a single throw away line from a character in another Star Wars movie and it shows. The writing has many good moments and other terrible ones I enjoyed all of the acting especially that of Diego Luno who was a very good part of the movie unfortunately none of the characters sold the team aspect of the movie and only seemed like a bunch of stranger who ran into each other this theme was still present at the end of the film. I thought this was an okay film but the potential was wasted with many of the scenes there are many amazing moments but overall the film lacks a good story and character development in my opinion. This is still a very watchable film and you will find out very interesting things about the Star Wars universe you didn't know and some of them seem as if you didn't even ask but are given the answer anyway. You can tell the creators are real Star Wars fans though and it is very well made the visuals are stunning but it seems at times whole sequences were cut short and that parts of the movie just went missing on the cutting room floor which is very unfortunate for a promising film like this. You should still watch this film if you enjoy Star Wars movies though but I might say it's not for the average viewer but you might like it if you're into sci-fi., 2.5,  Josh K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/931853787/, March 16 2018, N/A
 This movie is somewhat difficult to get invested in for a while as the characters are hard to identify and aren't particularly fleshed out by the climax makes up for all of this.

 Very underwhelming knowing that it's a Star Wars film but is fun at time. K2SO is so much fun and Chirrut Imwe is a badass. The villain Krennec was very bland but the troopers were well designed and well utilized. Jones was okay as Jyn Erso but wasn't as heroic as I predicted. Besides some fun action scenes Rogue One was a major disappointment and leaves me pessimistic looking at the future of the Star Wars side stories., 3.0,  A.J.

 Enjoyable genre movie-making that answers the question "How did the rebels get the Death Star plans?" and thus serves as a prelude to Episode 4: A New Hope which most of us know to be just Star Wars (1977). Indeed we are treated to cameos by Princess Leia (young Carrie Fisher digitally) C3PO &amp R2D2 (briefly) and Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) as well as some guy in Peter Cushing make-up. (Jimmy Smits is here but I don't know why since I gave Episodes 2 and 3 a miss). The real focus here is on new characters however. It seems Mads Mikkelsen's Galen Erso designed the Death Star for the Empire under pressure even after they killed his wife and sent his daughter into hiding (with Forest Whitaker of the Rebels). As revenge he put "the flaw" into the machinery that the plans reveal. Years later his daughter Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) becomes convinced to get those Death Star plans along with Diego Luna Donnie Yen Wen Jiang Riz Ahmed and a deadpan robot named K-2SO. Aussie Ben Mendelsohn is the chief baddie (apart from D. V.). It's all action from start to finish with the typical Star Wars blend of smart-ass dialogue bonding and sentimentality and good vs. evil shoot-em-ups. There are attempts to create distinct characters but they are not much more than pieces on the chess board here totemic though some may be. In the end the film looks good (CGI) and director Gareth Edwards keeps things moving at a good pace (however like many films today it is probably a bit too long). Conclusion: if you like the franchise this is well worth your time., 3.5,  Art S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/792064900/, March 15 2018, N/A

 "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" was an exciting sci-fi film that added well to the saga particularly to the original Star Wars film. The well-blended action originality and nostalgia made this film fun to watch from beginning to end. The performances by the characters were solid. Ben Mendelsohn's portrayal of Orson Krennic was my favorite performance of the film. He was a very believable intense villain with a decent amount of depth. However despite how much I enjoyed this film it definitely wasn't perfect.<br><br>My first issue with the film was the music. This had nothing to do with the fact that there was no opening crawl I actually appreciated that. I just thought that the music was sub-par in comparison to the rest of the saga. Now I don't think that the music was totally deplorable it just seemed like amateur work at certain points (i.e. the beginning). I also had a hard time investing in the majority of the characters. My least favorite character was Saw Guerrera. I couldn't stand his voice and really couldn't take hime seriously at all. In fact I disliked the majority of the first act with the exception of the very beginning and all the action which was great and explained Jyn's origins. My least favorite part was the giant-octopus scene. That was just weird and made Saw look like a complete joke.<br><br>Thankfully this movie really picked up in the second and 3rd act and totally saved it for me. Despite the iffy CGI I loved Tarkin's role in the film and Vader's scenes we're awesome. The final space battles we're a blast and looked very real with the blend of CGI/practical effects. The drama of the film also picked up in the third act which actually had me invested in the characters unlike the first act.<br><br>Overall "Rogue One" was a great film that really added to the original Star Wars narrative. When I left the theater the first thing I wanted to do was watch the original Star Wars film which for me meant that this new film was a job well done!, 3.5,  Jacob W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/968029823/, March 13 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a solid action packed star wars movie worthy of its place in the Star wars universe with a great collection of rag tag crew led by Felicity Jones this movie pulls us. A motley crew up against a monumental task it is reminiscent of "The Bridge on the River Kwai" impossible mission movies. It also solves one of the longest problems in the star wars story the vulnerability of the death star it fills in a gap with a great deal of wonderful movie magic. its climatic end is as sad as it is satisfying and the ending scenes as well as a few others that add the character of darth vader teases the heck out of the question will we see more of Darth Vader in the future? There some bad CGI Tarken but CGI is used to great effect in the battle scenes. Rogue One shows that the Star Wars universe is growing up the message of this movie is sometimes heros die in a good cause Its a grown up message for a grown up Star Wars., 3.5,  Oliver G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976979342/, March 10 2018, N/A

 The best Star Wars movie from a visual perspective. The story is good because it's gritty and actually tries to build credit with the audience. The biggest effect the movie has on the Star Wars universe is that it shows what the new trilogy (episodes 8 and 9) could have been instead of the mindless mess that they new trilogy has become. Apparently Disney can make a half-way decent Star Wars movie when they really want to. What a shame they've blown it with Episode 8 and particularly the disaster that was Episode 9., 4.0,  Mark S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977000071/, March 20 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a good spinoff. Originality is there acting is there and the visuals are there. The story itself though is kind of........ not. While the characters are very well put together and character development is solid the story is empty and somewhat confusing at times. Also let me stress this as much as I can if Star Wars does not have lightsabers than its not Star Wars., 3.0,  Smith T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977170552/, March 19 2018, N/A

 Despite being very fond of the original Star Wars trilogy I've always been more of a Star Trek fan than Star Wars and the recent Star Wars movies have only served to reinforce my preference and left me uninterested This movie however gets 10/10 and were all the Star Wars movies as good as this would certainly change the balance of the preference force., 5.0,  James C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/937277817/, March 17 2018, N/A
 This movie had many flaws with pacing and it felt very slow at times and dragging on all of the scenes seemed cut together in no manner that felt like it benefited the story. The characters are not all too likable except brief character building moments that are cut short for a action sequence. All of the interesting story beats are not monopolized on and it seems that they focused too much on making a movie that gave you information and not a story. This entire movie is based on a single throw away line from a character in another Star Wars movie and it shows. The writing has many good moments and other terrible ones I enjoyed all of the acting especially that of Diego Luno who was a very good part of the movie unfortunately none of the characters sold the team aspect of the movie and only seemed like a bunch of stranger who ran into each other this theme was still present at the end of the film. I thought this was an okay film but the potential was wasted with many of the scenes there are many amazing moments but overall the film lacks a good story and character development in my opinion. This is still a very watchable film and you will find out very interesting things about the Star Wars universe you didn't know and some of them seem as if you didn't even ask but are given the answer anyway. You can tell the creators are real Star Wars fans though and it is very well made the visuals are stunning but it seems at times whole sequences were cut short and that parts of the movie just went missing on the cutting room floor which is very unfortunate for a promising film like this. You should still watch this film if you enjoy Star Wars movies though but I might say it's not for the average viewer but you might like it if you're into sci-fi., 2.5,  Josh K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/931853787/, March 16 2018, N/A
 This movie is somewhat difficult to get invested in for a while as the characters are hard to identify and aren't particularly fleshed out by the climax makes up for all of this.

 Very underwhelming knowing that it's a Star Wars film but is fun at time. K2SO is so much fun and Chirrut Imwe is a badass. The villain Krennec was very bland but the troopers were well designed and well utilized. Jones was okay as Jyn Erso but wasn't as heroic as I predicted. Besides some fun action scenes Rogue One was a major disappointment and leaves me pessimistic looking at the future of the Star Wars side stories., 3.0,  A.J.

 Enjoyable genre movie-making that answers the question "How did the rebels get the Death Star plans?" and thus serves as a prelude to Episode 4: A New Hope which most of us know to be just Star Wars (1977). Indeed we are treated to cameos by Princess Leia (young Carrie Fisher digitally) C3PO &amp R2D2 (briefly) and Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) as well as some guy in Peter Cushing make-up. (Jimmy Smits is here but I don't know why since I gave Episodes 2 and 3 a miss). The real focus here is on new characters however. It seems Mads Mikkelsen's Galen Erso designed the Death Star for the Empire under pressure even after they killed his wife and sent his daughter into hiding (with Forest Whitaker of the Rebels). As revenge he put "the flaw" into the machinery that the plans reveal. Years later his daughter Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) becomes convinced to get those Death Star plans along with Diego Luna Donnie Yen Wen Jiang Riz Ahmed and a deadpan robot named K-2SO. Aussie Ben Mendelsohn is the chief baddie (apart from D. V.). It's all action from start to finish with the typical Star Wars blend of smart-ass dialogue bonding and sentimentality and good vs. evil shoot-em-ups. There are attempts to create distinct characters but they are not much more than pieces on the chess board here totemic though some may be. In the end the film looks good (CGI) and director Gareth Edwards keeps things moving at a good pace (however like many films today it is probably a bit too long). Conclusion: if you like the franchise this is well worth your time., 3.5,  Art S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/792064900/, March 15 2018, N/A

 "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" was an exciting sci-fi film that added well to the saga particularly to the original Star Wars film. The well-blended action originality and nostalgia made this film fun to watch from beginning to end. The performances by the characters were solid. Ben Mendelsohn's portrayal of Orson Krennic was my favorite performance of the film. He was a very believable intense villain with a decent amount of depth. However despite how much I enjoyed this film it definitely wasn't perfect.<br><br>My first issue with the film was the music. This had nothing to do with the fact that there was no opening crawl I actually appreciated that. I just thought that the music was sub-par in comparison to the rest of the saga. Now I don't think that the music was totally deplorable it just seemed like amateur work at certain points (i.e. the beginning). I also had a hard time investing in the majority of the characters. My least favorite character was Saw Guerrera. I couldn't stand his voice and really couldn't take hime seriously at all. In fact I disliked the majority of the first act with the exception of the very beginning and all the action which was great and explained Jyn's origins. My least favorite part was the giant-octopus scene. That was just weird and made Saw look like a complete joke.<br><br>Thankfully this movie really picked up in the second and 3rd act and totally saved it for me. Despite the iffy CGI I loved Tarkin's role in the film and Vader's scenes we're awesome. The final space battles we're a blast and looked very real with the blend of CGI/practical effects. The drama of the film also picked up in the third act which actually had me invested in the characters unlike the first act.<br><br>Overall "Rogue One" was a great film that really added to the original Star Wars narrative. When I left the theater the first thing I wanted to do was watch the original Star Wars film which for me meant that this new film was a job well done!, 3.5,  Jacob W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/968029823/, March 13 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a solid action packed star wars movie worthy of its place in the Star wars universe with a great collection of rag tag crew led by Felicity Jones this movie pulls us. A motley crew up against a monumental task it is reminiscent of "The Bridge on the River Kwai" impossible mission movies. It also solves one of the longest problems in the star wars story the vulnerability of the death star it fills in a gap with a great deal of wonderful movie magic. its climatic end is as sad as it is satisfying and the ending scenes as well as a few others that add the character of darth vader teases the heck out of the question will we see more of Darth Vader in the future? There some bad CGI Tarken but CGI is used to great effect in the battle scenes. Rogue One shows that the Star Wars universe is growing up the message of this movie is sometimes heros die in a good cause Its a grown up message for a grown up Star Wars., 3.5,  Oliver G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976979342/, March 10 2018, N/A

 The best Star Wars movie from a visual perspective. The story is good because it's gritty and actually tries to build credit with the audience. The biggest effect the movie has on the Star Wars universe is that it shows what the new trilogy (episodes 8 and 9) could have been instead of the mindless mess that they new trilogy has become. Apparently Disney can make a half-way decent Star Wars movie when they really want to. What a shame they've blown it with Episode 8 and particularly the disaster that was Episode 9., 4.0,  Mark S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977000071/, March 20 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a good spinoff. Originality is there acting is there and the visuals are there. The story itself though is kind of........ not. While the characters are very well put together and character development is solid the story is empty and somewhat confusing at times. Also let me stress this as much as I can if Star Wars does not have lightsabers than its not Star Wars., 3.0,  Smith T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977170552/, March 19 2018, N/A

 Despite being very fond of the original Star Wars trilogy I've always been more of a Star Trek fan than Star Wars and the recent Star Wars movies have only served to reinforce my preference and left me uninterested This movie however gets 10/10 and were all the Star Wars movies as good as this would certainly change the balance of the preference force., 5.0,  James C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/937277817/, March 17 2018, N/A
 This movie had many flaws with pacing and it felt very slow at times and dragging on all of the scenes seemed cut together in no manner that felt like it benefited the story. The characters are not all too likable except brief character building moments that are cut short for a action sequence. All of the interesting story beats are not monopolized on and it seems that they focused too much on making a movie that gave you information and not a story. This entire movie is based on a single throw away line from a character in another Star Wars movie and it shows. The writing has many good moments and other terrible ones I enjoyed all of the acting especially that of Diego Luno who was a very good part of the movie unfortunately none of the characters sold the team aspect of the movie and only seemed like a bunch of stranger who ran into each other this theme was still present at the end of the film. I thought this was an okay film but the potential was wasted with many of the scenes there are many amazing moments but overall the film lacks a good story and character development in my opinion. This is still a very watchable film and you will find out very interesting things about the Star Wars universe you didn't know and some of them seem as if you didn't even ask but are given the answer anyway. You can tell the creators are real Star Wars fans though and it is very well made the visuals are stunning but it seems at times whole sequences were cut short and that parts of the movie just went missing on the cutting room floor which is very unfortunate for a promising film like this. You should still watch this film if you enjoy Star Wars movies though but I might say it's not for the average viewer but you might like it if you're into sci-fi., 2.5,  Josh K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/931853787/, March 16 2018, N/A
 This movie is somewhat difficult to get invested in for a while as the characters are hard to identify and aren't particularly fleshed out by the climax makes up for all of this.

 Very underwhelming knowing that it's a Star Wars film but is fun at time. K2SO is so much fun and Chirrut Imwe is a badass. The villain Krennec was very bland but the troopers were well designed and well utilized. Jones was okay as Jyn Erso but wasn't as heroic as I predicted. Besides some fun action scenes Rogue One was a major disappointment and leaves me pessimistic looking at the future of the Star Wars side stories., 3.0,  A.J.

 Enjoyable genre movie-making that answers the question "How did the rebels get the Death Star plans?" and thus serves as a prelude to Episode 4: A New Hope which most of us know to be just Star Wars (1977). Indeed we are treated to cameos by Princess Leia (young Carrie Fisher digitally) C3PO &amp R2D2 (briefly) and Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) as well as some guy in Peter Cushing make-up. (Jimmy Smits is here but I don't know why since I gave Episodes 2 and 3 a miss). The real focus here is on new characters however. It seems Mads Mikkelsen's Galen Erso designed the Death Star for the Empire under pressure even after they killed his wife and sent his daughter into hiding (with Forest Whitaker of the Rebels). As revenge he put "the flaw" into the machinery that the plans reveal. Years later his daughter Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) becomes convinced to get those Death Star plans along with Diego Luna Donnie Yen Wen Jiang Riz Ahmed and a deadpan robot named K-2SO. Aussie Ben Mendelsohn is the chief baddie (apart from D. V.). It's all action from start to finish with the typical Star Wars blend of smart-ass dialogue bonding and sentimentality and good vs. evil shoot-em-ups. There are attempts to create distinct characters but they are not much more than pieces on the chess board here totemic though some may be. In the end the film looks good (CGI) and director Gareth Edwards keeps things moving at a good pace (however like many films today it is probably a bit too long). Conclusion: if you like the franchise this is well worth your time., 3.5,  Art S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/792064900/, March 15 2018, N/A

 "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" was an exciting sci-fi film that added well to the saga particularly to the original Star Wars film. The well-blended action originality and nostalgia made this film fun to watch from beginning to end. The performances by the characters were solid. Ben Mendelsohn's portrayal of Orson Krennic was my favorite performance of the film. He was a very believable intense villain with a decent amount of depth. However despite how much I enjoyed this film it definitely wasn't perfect.<br><br>My first issue with the film was the music. This had nothing to do with the fact that there was no opening crawl I actually appreciated that. I just thought that the music was sub-par in comparison to the rest of the saga. Now I don't think that the music was totally deplorable it just seemed like amateur work at certain points (i.e. the beginning). I also had a hard time investing in the majority of the characters. My least favorite character was Saw Guerrera. I couldn't stand his voice and really couldn't take hime seriously at all. In fact I disliked the majority of the first act with the exception of the very beginning and all the action which was great and explained Jyn's origins. My least favorite part was the giant-octopus scene. That was just weird and made Saw look like a complete joke.<br><br>Thankfully this movie really picked up in the second and 3rd act and totally saved it for me. Despite the iffy CGI I loved Tarkin's role in the film and Vader's scenes we're awesome. The final space battles we're a blast and looked very real with the blend of CGI/practical effects. The drama of the film also picked up in the third act which actually had me invested in the characters unlike the first act.<br><br>Overall "Rogue One" was a great film that really added to the original Star Wars narrative. When I left the theater the first thing I wanted to do was watch the original Star Wars film which for me meant that this new film was a job well done!, 3.5,  Jacob W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/968029823/, March 13 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a solid action packed star wars movie worthy of its place in the Star wars universe with a great collection of rag tag crew led by Felicity Jones this movie pulls us. A motley crew up against a monumental task it is reminiscent of "The Bridge on the River Kwai" impossible mission movies. It also solves one of the longest problems in the star wars story the vulnerability of the death star it fills in a gap with a great deal of wonderful movie magic. its climatic end is as sad as it is satisfying and the ending scenes as well as a few others that add the character of darth vader teases the heck out of the question will we see more of Darth Vader in the future? There some bad CGI Tarken but CGI is used to great effect in the battle scenes. Rogue One shows that the Star Wars universe is growing up the message of this movie is sometimes heros die in a good cause Its a grown up message for a grown up Star Wars., 3.5,  Oliver G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976979342/, March 10 2018, N/A

 Rogue One é realizado por Garth Edwards e tem lugar entre o episódio III (2005) e IV (1974) da saga Star Wars (1974 -). O maior elogio que posso fazer a este filme é que me fez apreciar ainda mais o episódio IV da série e o mundo de Star Wars em geral.<br><br>Devo dizer que este é um filme dedicado aos fãs da saga mas que deve também agradar a quem não acompanha fielmente a sua história. Contudo de forma a apreciar na totalidade esta experiência recomendo que tenham algum conhecimento dos restantes filmes ou até da banda desenhada.<br><br>No episódio IV sabemos que a Aliança Rebelde tem posse dos planos da Estrela da Morte assim como o conhecimento de uma pequena falha no seu projeto mas nunca soubemos como até então.<br><br>Em The Force Awakens (2015) Daisy Ridley esteve brilhante enquanto Rey agora Felicity Jones que interpreta Jyn Erso vem demonstrar que também ela é uma grande adição às estrelas femininas deste universo assim como ao elenco em geral. Ao longo do filme Jyn é uma das poucas personagens que tem de facto uma progressão individual. Sim não existe uma intenção em aprofundar as personagens neste filme e às vezes torna-se necessário para conseguirmos estabelecer um sentimento de pertença das mesmas na história ainda assim deixei-me comover em certos momentos.<br><br>Não há como não me comover quando a banda sonora de Michael Giacchino atinge o seu auge com apenas quatro semanas para a compor. A música em Star Wars é sentida como se de uma personagem se tratasse e embora neste filme não existam muitas faixas de destaque a composição é eficiente. Dê-lhe mais tempo e certamente que em futuros projetos o som será mais refinado.<br><br>O antagonista Director Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) é um vilão com uma progressão interessante ficando progressivamente mais enfurecido. Tem uma missão para concretizar e quer ficar com os merecidos créditos é um patife agradável de assistir. Também Donnie Yen que interpreta Chirrut Îmwe um ex-guardião de um templo dos Jedi que está bastante ligado à Força apresenta-se como uma personagem de relevo não só ao filme como à mitologia de Star Wars em geral. É uma personagem única num universo surpreendente.<br><br>K-2SO o novo robô foi uma presença necessária neste filme de guerra. Tudo desde os cenários às expressões e falas das personagens indicavam um clima de tensão e irritabilidade. Até mesmo a Aliança Rebelde por vezes tinha de cometer atos que não os deixavam muito orgulhosos. Este robô não só ajudou a harmonizar o ambiente com o seu sentido de humor sarcástico como também a monotonia que por vezes se sentia. Não de uma forma penosa ou nada que se parecesse mas à medida que o filme progredia mais sentíamos o que podíamos esperar dele.<br><br>O terceiro ato foi um dos melhores que a saga oferece. Principalmente os últimos trinta minutos que foram uma (muitas!) explosão de ação com a narrativa dividida em três pontos principais. Todas as cenas prenderam ao ecrã e fizeram-me estar investido no filme. No final há uma sequência em particular que certamente irá entrar no pódio dos melhores momentos de toda a saga.

While the characters are very well put together and character development is solid the story is empty and somewhat confusing at times. Also let me stress this as much as I can if Star Wars does not have lightsabers than its not Star Wars., 3.0,  Smith T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977170552/, March 19 2018, N/A

 This movie had many flaws with pacing and it felt very slow at times and dragging on all of the scenes seemed cut together in no manner that felt like it benefited the story. The characters are not all too likable except brief character building moments that are cut short for a action sequence. All of the interesting story beats are not monopolized on and it seems that they focused too much on making a movie that gave you information and not a story. This entire movie is based on a single throw away line from a character in another Star Wars movie and it shows. The writing has many good moments and other terrible ones I enjoyed all of the acting especially that of Diego Luno who was a very good part of the movie unfortunately none of the characters sold the team aspect of the movie and only seemed like a bunch of stranger who ran into each other this theme was still present at the end of the film. I thought this was an okay film but the potential was wasted with many of the scenes there are many amazing moments but overall the film lacks a good story and character development in my opinion. This is still a very watchable film and you will find out very interesting things about the Star Wars universe you didn't know and some of them seem as if you didn't even ask but are given the answer anyway. You can tell the creators are real Star Wars fans though and it is very well made the visuals are stunning but it seems at times whole sequences were cut short and that parts of the movie just went missing on the cutting room floor which is very unfortunate for a promising film like this. You should still watch this film if you enjoy Star Wars movies though but I might say it's not for the average viewer but you might like it if you're into sci-fi., 2.5,  Josh K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/931853787/, March 16 2018, N/A
 This movie is somewhat difficult to get invested in for a while as the characters are hard to identify and aren't particularly fleshed out by the climax makes up for all of this.

 Very underwhelming knowing that it's a Star Wars film but is fun at time. K2SO is so much fun and Chirrut Imwe is a badass. The villain Krennec was very bland but the troopers were well designed and well utilized. Jones was okay as Jyn Erso but wasn't as heroic as I predicted.

 Enjoyable genre movie-making that answers the question "How did the rebels get the Death Star plans?" and thus serves as a prelude to Episode 4: A New Hope which most of us know to be just Star Wars (1977). Indeed we are treated to cameos by Princess Leia (young Carrie Fisher digitally) C3PO &amp R2D2 (briefly) and Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) as well as some guy in Peter Cushing make-up. (Jimmy Smits is here but I don't know why since I gave Episodes 2 and 3 a miss). The real focus here is on new characters however. It seems Mads Mikkelsen's Galen Erso designed the Death Star for the Empire under pressure even after they killed his wife and sent his daughter into hiding (with Forest Whitaker of the Rebels). As revenge he put "the flaw" into the machinery that the plans reveal. Years later his daughter Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) becomes convinced to get those Death Star plans along with Diego Luna Donnie Yen Wen Jiang Riz Ahmed and a deadpan robot named K-2SO. Aussie Ben Mendelsohn is the chief baddie (apart from D. V.). It's all action from start to finish with the typical Star Wars blend of smart-ass dialogue bonding and sentimentality and good vs. evil shoot-em-ups. There are attempts to create distinct characters but they are not much more than pieces on the chess board here totemic though some may be. In the end the film looks good (CGI) and director Gareth Edwards keeps things moving at a good pace (however like many films today it is probably a bit too long). Conclusion: if you like the franchise this is well worth your time., 3.5,  Art S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/792064900/, March 15 2018, N/A

 "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" was an exciting sci-fi film that added well to the saga particularly to the original Star Wars film. The well-blended action originality and nostalgia made this film fun to watch from beginning to end. The performances by the characters were solid. Ben Mendelsohn's portrayal of Orson Krennic was my favorite performance of the film. He was a very believable intense villain with a decent amount of depth. However despite how much I enjoyed this film it definitely wasn't perfect.<br><br>My first issue with the film was the music. This had nothing to do with the fact that there was no opening crawl I actually appreciated that. I just thought that the music was sub-par in comparison to the rest of the saga. Now I don't think that the music was totally deplorable it just seemed like amateur work at certain points (i.e. the beginning). I also had a hard time investing in the majority of the characters. My least favorite character was Saw Guerrera. I couldn't stand his voice and really couldn't take hime seriously at all. In fact I disliked the majority of the first act with the exception of the very beginning and all the action which was great and explained Jyn's origins. My least favorite part was the giant-octopus scene. That was just weird and made Saw look like a complete joke.<br><br>Thankfully this movie really picked up in the second and 3rd act and totally saved it for me. Despite the iffy CGI I loved Tarkin's role in the film and Vader's scenes we're awesome. The final space battles we're a blast and looked very real with the blend of CGI/practical effects. The drama of the film also picked up in the third act which actually had me invested in the characters unlike the first act.<br><br>Overall "Rogue One" was a great film that really added to the original Star Wars narrative. When I left the theater the first thing I wanted to do was watch the original Star Wars film which for me meant that this new film was a job well done!, 3.5,  Jacob W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/968029823/, March 13 2018, N/A

 Rogue One is a solid action packed star wars movie worthy of its place in the Star wars universe with a great collection of rag tag crew led by Felicity Jones this movie pulls us. A motley crew up against a monumental task it is reminiscent of "The Bridge on the River Kwai" impossible mission movies. It also solves one of the longest problems in the star wars story the vulnerability of the death star it fills in a gap with a great deal of wonderful movie magic. its climatic end is as sad as it is satisfying and the ending scenes as well as a few others that add the character of darth vader teases the heck out of the question will we see more of Darth Vader in the future? There some bad CGI Tarken but CGI is used to great effect in the battle scenes. Rogue One shows that the Star Wars universe is growing up the message of this movie is sometimes heros die in a good cause Its a grown up message for a grown up Star Wars., 3.5,  Oliver G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976979342/, March 10 2018, N/A

 Rogue One é realizado por Garth Edwards e tem lugar entre o episódio III (2005) e IV (1974) da saga Star Wars (1974 -). O maior elogio que posso fazer a este filme é que me fez apreciar ainda mais o episódio IV da série e o mundo de Star Wars em geral.<br><br>Devo dizer que este é um filme dedicado aos fãs da saga mas que deve também agradar a quem não acompanha fielmente a sua história. Contudo de forma a apreciar na totalidade esta experiência recomendo que tenham algum conhecimento dos restantes filmes ou até da banda desenhada.<br><br>No episódio IV sabemos que a Aliança Rebelde tem posse dos planos da Estrela da Morte assim como o conhecimento de uma pequena falha no seu projeto mas nunca soubemos como até então.<br><br>Em The Force Awakens (2015) Daisy Ridley esteve brilhante enquanto Rey agora Felicity Jones que interpreta Jyn Erso vem demonstrar que também ela é uma grande adição às estrelas femininas deste universo assim como ao elenco em geral. Ao longo do filme Jyn é uma das poucas personagens que tem de facto uma progressão individual. Sim não existe uma intenção em aprofundar as personagens neste filme e às vezes torna-se necessário para conseguirmos estabelecer um sentimento de pertença das mesmas na história ainda assim deixei-me comover em certos momentos.<br><br>Não há como não me comover quando a banda sonora de Michael Giacchino atinge o seu auge com apenas quatro semanas para a compor. A música em Star Wars é sentida como se de uma personagem se tratasse e embora neste filme não existam muitas faixas de destaque a composição é eficiente. Dê-lhe mais tempo e certamente que em futuros projetos o som será mais refinado.<br><br>O antagonista Director Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) é um vilão com uma progressão interessante ficando progressivamente mais enfurecido. Tem uma missão para concretizar e quer ficar com os merecidos créditos é um patife agradável de assistir. Também Donnie Yen que interpreta Chirrut Îmwe um ex-guardião de um templo dos Jedi que está bastante ligado à Força apresenta-se como uma personagem de relevo não só ao filme como à mitologia de Star Wars em geral. É uma personagem única num universo surpreendente.<br><br>K-2SO o novo robô foi uma presença necessária neste filme de guerra. Tudo desde os cenários às expressões e falas das personagens indicavam um clima de tensão e irritabilidade. Até mesmo a Aliança Rebelde por vezes tinha de cometer atos que não os deixavam muito orgulhosos. Este robô não só ajudou a harmonizar o ambiente com o seu sentido de humor sarcástico como também a monotonia que por vezes se sentia. Não de uma forma penosa ou nada que se parecesse mas à medida que o filme progredia mais sentíamos o que podíamos esperar dele.<br><br>O terceiro ato foi um dos melhores que a saga oferece. Principalmente os últimos trinta minutos que foram uma (muitas!) explosão de ação com a narrativa dividida em três pontos principais. Todas as cenas prenderam ao ecrã e fizeram-me estar investido no filme. No final há uma sequência em particular que certamente irá entrar no pódio dos melhores momentos de toda a saga. É um final digno e apropriado para um dos meus filmes preferidos de Star Wars.<br><br>8/10, 4.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976856229/, March 10 2018, N/A
 The best Star Wars movie from a visual perspective. The story is good because it's gritty and actually tries to build credit with the audience. The biggest effect the movie has on the Star Wars universe is that it shows what the new trilogy (episodes 8 and 9) could have been instead of the mindless mess that they new trilogy has become. Apparently Disney can make a half-way decent Star Wars movie when they really want to. What a shame they've blown it with Episode 8 and particularly the disaster that was Episode 9., 4.0,  Mark S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977000071/, March 20 2018, N/A

This entire movie is based on a single throw away line from a character in another Star Wars movie and it shows. The writing has many good moments and other terrible ones I enjoyed all of the acting especially that of Diego Luno who was a very good part of the movie unfortunately none of the characters sold the team aspect of the movie and only seemed like a bunch of stranger who ran into each other this theme was still present at the end of the film. I thought this was an okay film but the potential was wasted with many of the scenes there are many amazing moments but overall the film lacks a good story and character development in my opinion. This is still a very watchable film and you will find out very interesting things about the Star Wars universe you didn't know and some of them seem as if you didn't even ask but are given the answer anyway. You can tell the creators are real Star Wars fans though and it is very well made the visuals are stunning but it seems at times whole sequences were cut short and that parts of the movie just went missing on the cutting room floor which is very unfortunate for a promising film like this. You should still watch this film if you enjoy Star Wars movies though but I might say it's not for the average viewer but you might like it if you're into sci-fi., 2.5,  Josh K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/931853787/, March 16 2018, N/A
 This movie is somewhat difficult to get invested in for a while as the characters are hard to identify and aren't particularly fleshed out by the climax makes up for all of this. It had amazing action was very tense and definitely had one of the best parts of any Star Wars movie., 3.5,  Dylan C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977133114/, March 16 2018, N/A
 Inherently unnecessary but action-packed and suitably intense Rogue One gives Star Wars fans another adventure to enjoy even if it seems choppy at times., 3.5,  Andrew S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/975468505/, March 16 2018, N/A
 Very underwhelming knowing that it's a Star Wars film but is fun at time. K2SO is so much fun and Chirrut Imwe is a badass. The villain Krennec was very bland but the troopers were well designed and well utilized. Jones was okay as Jyn Erso but wasn't as heroic as I predicted. Besides some fun action scenes Rogue One was a major disappointment and leaves me pessimistic looking at the future of the Star Wars side stories., 3.0,  A.J.

 I thought this was An awesome addition to the FRANCHISE it put into perspective what had to happen for the deathstar plans to get to the PRINCESS. Great job, 5.0,  Allan%20 R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977165995/, March 15 2018, N/A
 Enjoyable genre movie-making that answers the question "How did the rebels get the Death Star plans?" and thus serves as a prelude to Episode 4: A New Hope which most of us know to be just Star Wars (1977). Indeed we are treated to cameos by Princess Leia (young Carrie Fisher digitally) C3PO &amp R2D2 (briefly) and Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) as well as some guy in Peter Cushing make-up. (Jimmy Smits is here but I don't know why since I gave Episodes 2 and 3 a miss). The real focus here is on new characters however. It seems Mads Mikkelsen's Galen Erso designed the Death Star for the Empire under pressure even after they killed his wife and sent his daughter into hiding (with Forest Whitaker of the Rebels). As revenge he put "the flaw" into the machinery that the plans reveal. Years later his daughter Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) becomes convinced to get those Death Star plans along with Diego Luna Donnie Yen Wen Jiang Riz Ahmed and a deadpan robot named K-2SO. Aussie Ben Mendelsohn is the chief baddie (apart from D. V.). It's all action from start to finish with the typical Star Wars blend of smart-ass dialogue bonding and sentimentality and good vs. evil shoot-em-ups. There are attempts to create distinct characters but they are not much more than pieces on the chess board here totemic though some may be. In the end the film looks good (CGI) and director Gareth Edwards keeps things moving at a good pace (however like many films today it is probably a bit too long). Conclusion: if you like the franchise this is well worth your time., 3.5,  Art S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/792064900/, March 15 2018, N/A
 Great special effects great action ok story weak characters. Don't need to see it again and don't feel compelled to watch multiple times. Twice is enough for me, 3.0,  RandomWhiterun g, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977165399/, March 14 2018, N/A

 (89/100)<br>A movie that we didn't even deserve made so great deserves a place in the top 5 Star Wars movies (for now)., 4.5,  Merijn J, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976493206/, March 13 2018, N/A
 "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" was an exciting sci-fi film that added well to the saga particularly to the original Star Wars film. The well-blended action originality and nostalgia made this film fun to watch from beginning to end. The performances by the characters were solid. Ben Mendelsohn's portrayal of Orson Krennic was my favorite performance of the film. He was a very believable intense villain with a decent amount of depth. However despite how much I enjoyed this film it definitely wasn't perfect.<br><br>My first issue with the film was the music. This had nothing to do with the fact that there was no opening crawl I actually appreciated that. I just thought that the music was sub-par in comparison to the rest of the saga. Now I don't think that the music was totally deplorable it just seemed like amateur work at certain points (i.e. the beginning). I also had a hard time investing in the majority of the characters. My least favorite character was Saw Guerrera. I couldn't stand his voice and really couldn't take hime seriously at all. In fact I disliked the majority of the first act with the exception of the very beginning and all the action which was great and explained Jyn's origins. My least favorite part was the giant-octopus scene. That was just weird and made Saw look like a complete joke.<br><br>Thankfully this movie really picked up in the second and 3rd act and totally saved it for me. Despite the iffy CGI I loved Tarkin's role in the film and Vader's scenes we're awesome. The final space battles we're a blast and looked very real with the blend of CGI/practical effects. The drama of the film also picked up in the third act which actually had me invested in the characters unlike the first act.<br><br>Overall "Rogue One" was a great film that really added to the original Star Wars narrative. When I left the theater the first thing I wanted to do was watch the original Star Wars film which for me meant that this new film was a job well done!, 3.5,  Jacob W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/968029823/, March 13 2018, N/A
 A good fun star wars movie., 5.0,  Michael R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977159211/, March 11 2018, N/A
 Rogue One is a solid action packed star wars movie worthy of its place in the Star wars universe with a great collection of rag tag crew led by Felicity Jones this movie pulls us. A motley crew up against a monumental task it is reminiscent of "The Bridge on the River Kwai" impossible mission movies. It also solves one of the longest problems in the star wars story the vulnerability of the death star it fills in a gap with a great deal of wonderful movie magic. its climatic end is as sad as it is satisfying and the ending scenes as well as a few others that add the character of darth vader teases the heck out of the question will we see more of Darth Vader in the future? There some bad CGI Tarken but CGI is used to great effect in the battle scenes. Rogue One shows that the Star Wars universe is growing up the message of this movie is sometimes heros die in a good cause Its a grown up message for a grown up Star Wars., 3.5,  Oliver G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976979342/, March 10 2018, N/A
 Disney hits another movie gem with this prequel. The future of Star Wars is bright., 4.0,  Roman C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976827711/, March 10 2018, N/A
 Rogue One é realizado por Garth Edwards e tem lugar entre o episódio III (2005) e IV (1974) da saga Star Wars (1974 -). O maior elogio que posso fazer a este filme é que me fez apreciar ainda mais o episódio IV da série e o mundo de Star Wars em geral.<br><br>Devo dizer que este é um filme dedicado aos fãs da saga mas que deve também agradar a quem não acompanha fielmente a sua história. Contudo de forma a apreciar na totalidade esta experiência recomendo que tenham algum conhecimento dos restantes filmes ou até da banda desenhada.<br><br>No episódio IV sabemos que a Aliança Rebelde tem posse dos planos da Estrela da Morte assim como o conhecimento de uma pequena falha no seu projeto mas nunca soubemos como até então.<br><br>Em The Force Awakens (2015) Daisy Ridley esteve brilhante enquanto Rey agora Felicity Jones que interpreta Jyn Erso vem demonstrar que também ela é uma grande adição às estrelas femininas deste universo assim como ao elenco em geral. Ao longo do filme Jyn é uma das poucas personagens que tem de facto uma progressão individual. Sim não existe uma intenção em aprofundar as personagens neste filme e às vezes torna-se necessário para conseguirmos estabelecer um sentimento de pertença das mesmas na história ainda assim deixei-me comover em certos momentos.<br><br>Não há como não me comover quando a banda sonora de Michael Giacchino atinge o seu auge com apenas quatro semanas para a compor. A música em Star Wars é sentida como se de uma personagem se tratasse e embora neste filme não existam muitas faixas de destaque a composição é eficiente. Dê-lhe mais tempo e certamente que em futuros projetos o som será mais refinado.<br><br>O antagonista Director Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) é um vilão com uma progressão interessante ficando progressivamente mais enfurecido. Tem uma missão para concretizar e quer ficar com os merecidos créditos é um patife agradável de assistir. Também Donnie Yen que interpreta Chirrut Îmwe um ex-guardião de um templo dos Jedi que está bastante ligado à Força apresenta-se como uma personagem de relevo não só ao filme como à mitologia de Star Wars em geral. É uma personagem única num universo surpreendente.<br><br>K-2SO o novo robô foi uma presença necessária neste filme de guerra. Tudo desde os cenários às expressões e falas das personagens indicavam um clima de tensão e irritabilidade. Até mesmo a Aliança Rebelde por vezes tinha de cometer atos que não os deixavam muito orgulhosos. Este robô não só ajudou a harmonizar o ambiente com o seu sentido de humor sarcástico como também a monotonia que por vezes se sentia. Não de uma forma penosa ou nada que se parecesse mas à medida que o filme progredia mais sentíamos o que podíamos esperar dele.<br><br>O terceiro ato foi um dos melhores que a saga oferece. Principalmente os últimos trinta minutos que foram uma (muitas!) explosão de ação com a narrativa dividida em três pontos principais. Todas as cenas prenderam ao ecrã e fizeram-me estar investido no filme. No final há uma sequência em particular que certamente irá entrar no pódio dos melhores momentos de toda a saga. É um final digno e apropriado para um dos meus filmes preferidos de Star Wars.<br><br>8/10, 4.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976856229/, March 10 2018, N/A
