 The movie has no substance. It is just a reshuffling of previously used cool looking scenes without any logic. Characters are unappealing (with the exception of Luke) and are mostly just a collection of obligatory racially diverse plastic toys. There is no mythic quality no soul in the movie. Characters act nonsensically it is really a pain to watch it. And the violet-haired woman is unbearable., 0.5,  Jan K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/835887539/, March 20 2018, N/A

 I loved Disney as a kid but they used to care about good story telling. It seems like the movie was written to sell toys. Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson don't understand the franchise!<br>My problems with Star Wars VIII are:<br><br>1. Bomber Ships from the beginning of the movie moved super slow and were super easily destroyed....did the Resistance not design them for war? ...Also bombs don't drop in space. <br>2. The Force Awakens was about finding Luke Skywalker. He left a map and Rey tracks him down and brings him his original lightsaber as a gift! Then he just throws it away? It is supposed to be funny?...or was it a "f*** you" to fans who have been speculating about what Luke would say? (It was originally his father Anakin Skywalker's lightsaber that was passed down to him by Ben Kenobi when he first became a jedi. WTF?)<br>3. The "Rian Johnson Version" of Scaredy-Cat-Luke wanted to kill his Nephew because he sensed the dark side in him even though Luke refused to kill his own father because he believed there was some good left in him. (Even though he extinguished the Jedi Order and killed all the younglings and committed genocide by destroying entire planets...). What had Ben Solo done that was even close to that evil?<br>4. Space Ships with laser guns still run on FUEL?...It seems like a stupid plot device to create a countdown clock (Spoiler...18 hours) so there is time for drama between Vice Admiral Holdo and Poe Dameron and room for a side story for Rose and Finn.<br>5. Holdo refuses to tell Poe the plan? WTF? If the Resistance is so depleted even with Poe's demotion he is still second in command and she won't tell him the plan? And when he staged a mutiny....she still refuses to discuss her plan. If she was a diplomat wouldn't she have the social skills to resolve this better?<br>6. The Rose and Finn side story was a failure! They had 18 hours to get to a casino planet and return. Which must have been really close since they didn't travel at light speed....how LUCKY! Then they are told by Maz Kanata that they need to find a specific hacker who can disable the First Order's tracking system. Finn must have asked for Maz to exchange phone numbers when he met her on Toakodana for 5 minutes (in the Force Awakens)....how LUCKY! But before they can find the hacker Finn and Rose get arrested for a parking ticket...but there is a hacker who can do the job in the same prison cell with them...how LUCKY! He can let himself out of prison anytime so then take some "ME" time and free some alien horses (on an island where they will be rounded up the next day) and destroy some property (which is insured and will most likely make the "evil" rich people even more money) Then they fly away with the untrustworthy code breaker leaving all those slave children to CLEAN UP THE MESS?! What heros?....When they are captured by the First Order their essential "Code Breaker" spills the beans about the Rebels plan to evacuate and Hux begins destroying the escape pods. Rose and Finn caused half of the remaining Resistance to be blown up!? Which they never regret or even acknowledge.<br>6. Superman Leia....returns from death but now Carrie Fisher tragically died. So now she will have to die off screen before the next movie? (and when they open the door to let her back on the ship....no air or people get sucked out?....is the cold vacuum of space a myth?) <br>7. They kill admiral Ackbar off-screen? It seems like they just wanted to create room for sexy purple haired Hunger-Games Holdo!<br>8. Luke dies meditating? If he was going to die it would have been more impactful if he did it in person (we saw the sunken X-Wing or did he forget to renew his driver's license)<br><br>Kathleen Kennedy may have worked with David Spielberg but she has none of his instincts or tallent. She needs to step down before she tanks the entire franchize.....<br>She hired Rian Johnson to write the script..., 0.5,  Andrew B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/932079324/, March 20 2018, N/A
 I watched this movie and was in total amazement how both Disney and the director are so out of touch with the Star Wars universe and audience demographic!

 The last jedi was not only a lazy piece of cinema but a failed attempt to combine the problems of our reality with the wars in the stars. Rather than working with the masses of lore within the star wars universe--riaan johnson decided that 2017 slap-stick humor and plot confusion was a better fit. Sad to see star wars sink to the status of the sub-par yearly marvel movies. You had the gift of working with star wars and made something forgettable with it.

 ATTENTION : Please give at Rotten Tomatoes at least 1 point otherwise the review is not in the rating! Thank you !!!<br><br>Say Rotten Tomatoes you have the choice counting machine from Florida in 2006. Since January it stays at 3/5 although you can see 10 x 0-1 stars and 2 x 4-5 stars? that looks a blind that the cut is not 3 !!!<br><br>Disney please make the movie again based on TFA. You can kill the old heroes - but please with DIGNITY !!! You can take women and actors in the main roles of all countries - but with a good story development and why they do something !!!<br>Is that too much ?<br><br>Hey you paid professional critics that was probably bad did you really believe that we are stupid? A few colorful pictures and cute animals and the story we do not care? HaHaHa you are no credible critic anymore :-) Find a new job we will not look at you anymore if we want to know something about a movie. Disney paid you and then exposed you bad luck<br><br>Look at one TFA after 2 years 842 pages reviews 88% audience reviews TLJ after 3 months 2094 pages at 48% (with correct count of zero and half stars about 25%) something is wrong with the MOVIE :-) ))<br><br>Rotten Tomatoes count no or half stars ratings so the evaluation is correct !!! You can not offer no stars or half stars but they do not value like all other evaluations !!!<br><br>Here two 5 star reviews behind each other one with name one without name please do not say that's coincidence!!!<br><br>joao v<br>March 3 2018<br>(2ºC) star wars is a very good movie has a good interpretation and has incredible history<br><br>March 3 2018<br>(2ºC) star wars is very good movie has a good interpretation and has incredible story.<br><br>Disney paid 5 stars one-liners and now they are almost the same the writers will not remember anything about this Star Wars Horror Movie :-)<br><br>Critics who are looking forward to part 9 you can choose the chairs in the cinema you will have plenty of space :-))<br><br>Some 5 star reviewers write the film has implemented 1.3 billion he must be good?<br>1: If we had known beforehand what would have happened the movie would not have made a billion.<br>2: TFA made over 2 billion small difference - right? TLJ can not do that anymore.<br>3: Now that we know what's coming of bad writing - solo / SW9 certainly not that high except for Ron Howard / JJ making extraordinary movies with a wonderful story such as Rogue One that's saying now.<br><br>Let's see if you (Disney) have bet on the right horse. The only thing that matters is - Money - let's see who has more your new audience or us - Premiere Star Wars 1977 - Fans who do not want to see Star Wars 9 :-)<br><br>Of course TFA is based on AnH and TLJ on TESB / RofJ. The hero travels to master Rey / Luke - Luke / Yoda his friends fight elsewhere Saltplanet / Endor. The hero must cancel the teaching mission to save his friends. Hollywood and the studios have been making bad story writing for years - look to the remakes / prequels and more. A handful of films are good over 80% not! We have noticed this here in Germany for 15 years you in filmmaker country not?<br><br>I just wanted to tell a good story whether the main role of a woman or an actor from any country I do not care. I have not written a review on Star Wars since 1977. But now it had to be TLJ has great pictures but nothing else ...<br><br>and now...<br><br>About - the last Jedi - a Spaceballs Saga<br><br>I can't believe we live in a world now where the prequels AREN'T the worst star wars movies anymore.<br><br>The movie is good for 10 year old kids who just want to see a fast / actually slow colorful space battle with cute animals and do not understand an important good story.<br><br>A Jedi Master who has been trained for years and saves his father (Darh Vader) later wants to kill sleeping nephew with the lightsaber for bad thoughts?<br><br>He's tired of hiding but he's putting a card in circulation where he can be found?<br><br>He throws his lightsaber over his shoulder and goes trinking milk by space cows?<br><br>What does Luke think about Han Solo's death - nothing. What friendship has emerged over the years :-(<br><br>Kylo - weep weep stomp stomp with his legs like a child - is a super evil? He kills his father and can not shoot his mother? Please take a look at the last 5 minutes of Rogue One - that's a badass Vader !!!<br><br>Anyway Rogue One gets more and more attention since WS8 is out thank you very much for the new appreciation !!! Only good SW movie since - 1983 ( Prequels and TFA is o.k )<br><br>The phone prank by Poe to Hux is not funny.<br><br>Fin in SW7 wants to flee and become a hero Fin in SW 8 wants to flee and becomes a hero - well almost his love comes between :-))<br><br>Hux is Lord Helmet of Spaceballs - From now on I'm not afraid of the new - Dark Side :-)<br><br>The chase of spaceships is like one truck overtaking another.<br><br>Spaceships need petrol stations ?<br><br>Nobody Rey - beats decades of trained Jedi like Luke and Kylo Ren - without much training - WHAT? Soon finished Jedi wants to be born :-)<br><br>Please consider the movie plays 2 hours after TFA!<br><br>The fight of Rey and Kylo against the bodyguards of Snoke that should have been the best lightsaber fight in the Starwars universe at the 5 star reviewers ??? What was missing? Oh yes no one uses the Force only sword fight and take each other in a sweatbox WTF<br><br>Leah should have died in SW8 - instead of becoming a supergirl :-(<br><br>You save animals but not slave children nice<br><br>Disney: You make rich people bad (casino plot) since you're poor?<br><br>The new Star Wars should be - not only black and white - Here all men are stupid and all women are clever ?<br><br>Beware BB-8 aka - the new Terminator - shoots coins more than he is tall - funny ? NO<br><br>All characters are exactly 2.5 hours where they were at the beginning :-(<br><br>The mighty Snok is dead? I do not care I do not really know him!<br><br>The good thing is from now on you can do all threatening things like dead stars spaceships evil planet the new order destroy by autopilot and hyper jump :-) We do not need Jedi more and that just where everyone can become a Jedi without effort training history personal experiences and teachers ... :-(<br><br>Look first Rogue One then a new Hope - and then SW7 / SW8 - you understand about Storyline?<br><br>Good CGI technology does not replace a good story - it supports the story<br><br>What does Mark Hamill say about his new Luke role? It's not Luke's character<br><br>Luke Skywalker is so iconic that Mark Hamill only had voice roles in Hollywood movies since 1983. His 3 minutes in SW7 TFA was goose bumps with me. And now he dissolves in the air ???<br>I am so sad Mark - I think of you as you were in my childhood the greatest hero of all time :-)) May the force be with you ....<br><br>ps: do not go back to Disney Star Wars.<br><br>To Kathleen Kennedy :<br><br>You look for strong women look at 1977 - 83 Princess Lea was strong she was not scared for Darth Vader while everyone around him was shaking she actively helps with her rescue. She is tortured by Darth Vader and later becomes active again in the fight for the rebelion. She strangles the mighty Jaba with her bare hands and a chain. She is always at the very front when fighting with laser pistols.<br><br>R.I.P Carrie Fisher<br><br>or... Felicity Jones aka Jyn Erso in Rogue One I think I have seen that she is a strong woman and has grown with her duties. AND she had to teach seek to make decisions make decisions until her death - I felt with her!<br><br>or think of Ripley aka Sigourney Weaver in Alien 1979<br><br>And now there is - I can do anything right now Rey ... what a Stroyline. What did you want to tell the youth Disney?<br><br>Hey kids life is great - everyone has the Force to use them without teaching they bring you cola chips and the joystick into your hands while you sit on the sofa do not bother and do not forget to buy our toys :-)<br><br>Look at the little boy at the end of the movie he uses the power for his broom. Anakin was also a slave boy but what did he need to become jedi ???? Ahhhh years of training ....<br><br>How do colored actors need political correctness - who is Billy Dee Williams - SW2 TESB 1980?<br>By the way how great would it have been if instead of Benicio Del Toro had played the hacker :-)<br><br>Let the past die kill it if you have to said Disney :-) <br>Well congratulations you've killed the old premiere customers since 1977. I'm looking forward to the box office of Solo and SW9 :-)))<br><br>So there is much else but I do not feel like it anymore ....<br><br>This - new way - of Star Wars will NOT be mine ....<br><br>Disney / Kennedy / Johnson = no more money from me !!! I know Disney that hurts you the most :-))<br><br>This is not my Luke Han shot first and only Chewbacca eats porgs Jedi needs training more than 10 minutes... and and and....<br><br>Greetings from Germany may the force be with us - except the makers of this film..., 1.0,  Frank B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977079793/, March 20 2018, N/A

 Great visuals and sound but that's it. I'm a long term Star Wars fan and this movie is nothing more than an insult. The plot itself does not make any sense. I'm not explaining that further because there are a ton of YT videos that do it for me.<br><br>Thank you for destroying our beloved characters. This is a new trilogy with new characters I get that but why can't you just let the old ones rest with a bit of dignity left? Luke trying to murder his nephew in his sleep??? Are you kidding me? Chewie is nothing more than a cab driver. But Leia (probably because she is female but that is just a guess) turns into a powerful force user able to survive a blast with no training whatsoever. What the fuck? You gave Adm. Ackbar how much screen time before killing him? I guess as a male character from the OT you are having a bad time with K. Kennedy in charge at Lucasfilm.<br><br>The SJW Vice Admiral character acts like one of those teachers that nobody likes. Why the hell wouldn't you just tell Poe your plan? This makes literally no sense. Poe's reaction to this is completely human and understandable to me. I CAN RELATE TO THAT because even I thought that this woman was a spy or had just given up. But no no ... She had a solid plan all along and just did not tell Poe and in the end they are LAUGHING about him and how stupid he was. WHAT THE HELL? Why not this provides just another oppurtunity to show how women can do everything better and are overall much smarter. Let's get this straight: I don't have the slightest problem with cunning intelligent female characters. Take Sansa from GOT. It just has to make sense but in this movie it's forced and therefore doesn't work. <br><br>I laughed really hard about what they did to Phasma. What the fuck? AGIAN? From watching the trailers interviews and whatsoever you could get the impression that Phasma is an important character but she literally has a ridiculously small amount of screen time. Why even bother to cast (and pay) Gwendoline Christie for the role? I like her and she did a good job portraying Brienne. Why not use her character for anything? This supposedly though Captain Phasma acts stupid in BOTH movies and (big suprise) gets trashed in BOTH (one time literally).<br><br>I could go on about this for hours but I'm ending it here. Sorry guys but the new Star Wars canon is dead for me. Perhaps I will buy some of the old (now "Legends") novells I didn't get to read before.

 This has to be the worst Star Wars movie I've ever seen. I never make reviews but this movie deserves one. Please save your money for anything else and save yourself from being ashamed at what has become of Star Wars.<br>Pros: Great visuals albeit the red was overdone in the movie.<br><br>Cons: Dialogue and humor were contrived and out of touch leading to a very confusing script. <br>Character development of the protagonists and antagonists are almost non-existent with the characters either becoming expendable or shells of what they were in The Force Awakens.<br>Instead of Luke coming off as a broken man he became a mockery of his former self resembling a town drunkard.<br>Rey's potential in this movie was wasted and instead we have Canto Bight shoved in our face.<br>Hux Poe and Finn are bumbling fools compared to the last movie.<br>Holdo was thrown in for no other reason than to have her wasted.<br>Verdict: Rian Johnson should stick to TV series. He has no respect for the name Star Wars butchering what JJ set up for him. This movie seems like it wanted to add suspense but ultimately gives us nothing. I walked out of the theater having no interest in what happens next. There is nothing in this movie that furthered my interest in the new characters ratherer it "killed the past" in the most disrespectful way., 1.0,  Candon O, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977175303/, March 20 2018, N/A
 I felt this movie completely disrespected the original Star Wars characters and story. Luke was a completely different character in this movie and did things his original character would have never done in the original Star Wars trilogy. I thought the new story was terrible and I noticed many plot holes. I also noticed an anti-male undertone in the movie.

 I created this account just to voice my frustration with this movie. I've heard a lot of men complain about this movie being too progressive and all I can say is as much as I wish it was it's not even that. It's just terrible.<br><br>Force Awakens and Rogue One were such amazing additions to Star Wars I have no idea how the Last Jedi went so wrong.<br><br>The Force Awakens and Rogue One promised us a new generation of Star Wars. A new fandom where diversity was welcomed and anyone could be a Star Wars fan. But this movie threw all of that out and reminded us that this universe does not care about its fans and is willing to pay diversity a lip service as long as it means a quick buck.<br><br>Daisy Ridley deserved a better movie. I don't blame her for wanting to be done with Star Wars after episode IX. Gone is Rey's Cambpell-esque heroic journey replaced by a plot that has nearly all of her actions revolving around the actions of other characters not to mention the incredibly toxic shipping pair that is Reylo. She is no longer the main character of her own trilogy. And as if that wasn't bad enough one of her best scenes where she has actual agency ends up getting cut from the final movie.<br><br>Gone is Finn's emotional growth from Force Awakens instead he was treated off-handedly and with little care. Rian Johnson even joked about keeping Finn in a coma for the entirety of the movie. Not only that but his side-plot introduced Rose as a potential candidate for a love triangle that is handled both clumsily and inappropriately. And for all of the chemistry that the first movie developed between Rey and Finn and the apparent friendship that Daisy Ridley and John Boyega have shared this movie has one scene. One. Where the two are reunited (it lasts a minute and they hug). There isn't even a scene of closure at the end between the two of them. They don't even get a chance to hold a single conversation.<br><br>As for Holdo while I liked her character a lot Poe's character assassination should not have been the price to pay for her addition to the movie. This is a fictional world. If the director wanted to show what toxic masculinity looks like he could have done so using the Resistance's heirarchy of command or a chauvinist captain there's no limit to how many new characters he can create. But instead he completely changes everything we know about Poe (both from the first movie and the comic series) and continues to enforce a stereotype that does little to help anyone that could relate to Poe from the first movie or Latinos in general.<br><br>Not to mention Rose's under-utilization and strangely hypocritical behavior at the end the plot holes the pacing issues the abandoned plot threads from Episode VII. And don't even get me started on Captain Phasma. We were promised by Lucasfilm both on the marketing tour the comics the Phasma novelization and in interviews that Captain Phasma would be coming back. Instead she's in all of 5 minutes or so and then gets "killed." Even her deleted cutscene has her being killed.<br><br>Finally as a side-note. There are plenty of quotes and interviews were Daisy Ridley and especially Mark Hamil and other actors have expressed frustration and confusion over their roles and the direction of the plot. But none of their concerns were ever addressed instead they had to follow the "vision" of their "auteur" director Rian Johnson. Was it the movie Rian Johnson wanted to make? Undoubtedly. Is it a good movie? questionable. Is it a proper sequal to the Force Awakens? Absolutely not. <br>Is it feminist?<br><br>Haha. Not even close. We now have a movie that has killed off (Holdo Phasma) written off (Rose) has to write off (Leia) or relegated to cameo status (Maz) every single woman in the movie other than Rey while Kylo Hux Poe and Finn get to continue the story. And as for Rey well the Last Jedi has made it abundently clear that this is no longer her story it's Kylo's. Unless we want to go down the incredibly toxic journey that is Reylo. I want to say we won't but Rian Johnson's quote regarding the scene where Rey and Kylo force touch as "the closest thing we'll get to a sex scene in a Star Wars movie" does not leave me feeling confident.<br><br>I became a die-hard Star Wars fan with the Force Awakens and loved Rogue One but with the Last Jedi Lucasfilm has almost killed Star Wars for me., 1.0,  Rey S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977172547/, March 18 2018, N/A

 As a one off movie the Last Jedi could be given a strong score. However its not. I feel Johnson does not understand the cultural power of Star Wars. I'm a 55 year old father who has seen every Star Wars movie multiple times in the theater along with making and buying Star Wars toys and costumes. I am a total fan. I feel if you watch the special features of the 'Force Awakens' and 'The Last Jedi' you'll will see why 'The Last Jedi' Failed. Abrams Directors Documentary was about his important role to the legacy and honoring the past and future of the family saga and the importance of the metaphors and personal characters within saga. The most common words heard from Abrams were 'We' 'History' 'Honor' 'Respect'. When I watched Johnsons Directors documentary It was about images sets and surprise. Johnsons most common word is 'I'. Its all about what he thinks and wants. Nothing to do with the big picture. Force of change is missing. Star Wars is more then a movie. It gives us parents and mentors REAL examples to teach our kids. Johnson seemed to not care about any of the cultural importance to the history and cultural legacy. It just seemed he wanted to compete with 'Thor' or 'Wonder Woman'. Please change Directors to someone who cares about our legacy., 2.0,  kevin b, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977172556/, March 18 2018, N/A

 Well this is my very first review for this site. And I just got to say that TLJ SUCKED! It sucked out loud!<br><br>But it really irritates me that this audience score doesn't really seem to want to budge. I doubt my review will make any difference here. But I will at least try. Now this is the SW film that really killed any and all enthusiasm I had for this great series. But to be fair TFA was really the start. What is the point of all these new Disney Wars films? To remind us of the OT? Well if I want to be "reminded" of the OT I will watch the OT. All these new ones are doing is taking plot points and dialogue from the OT and just putting a new coat of paint on them. I mean it isn't like in 9 the rebels won't beat the FO. Or that they won't restore the Republic(again). Or that Kylo Ren will turn to the light side and MaRey Sue will go and restore the Jedi order(again).None of this will happen.../S<br><br><br>But my biggest gripe is with how they treat the force in these movies. In TFA when Kylo Ren told Snoke that she was untrained and then seen her use the force after that? It was pretty much game over time for me. They turned MaRey Sue into the new Tinkerbell. She will just fly around and sprinkle magic force pixie dust on everyone will be Jedi masters. No training required. This is all made for the "Veruca Salt" generation. The "I WANT IT NOW!" generation. Instant knowledge training skills etc. No training or hardship required. <br><br><br>So basically when they do try something "new" or "bold" this is what we get? When they aren't recreating the OT they will just make the force where anyone is capable of manipulating it without training and effort. Like broom boy for instance. He just goes and force pulls a broom to him like no big deal. I am very sure he got loads of training in a stable after picking up space horse dung all day.../S<br><br><br>Then in comes Johnson to try to solve MaRey Sue's issues by making her the balance of light to Kylo's dark. So they both get equally stronger. Except that it was Kylo that trained and earned all those skills! While MaRey Sue just gets all the skills without training and earning them. So I really don't see why they should both get EQUALLY stronger when one deserves it while the other does not. <br><br><br>Now on to poor Luke. He wasn't really happy with this new trilogy from the start. I know he came out and took back what he said but the fact that he thought his character should be called "Jake Skywalker" tells it all. No amount of apologies can ever take that away. He was right with his initial assessment. He should have stuck to his words the first time. But they made him hellbent on wanting to destroy the Jedi way. The "real" Luke would have never done this. He was hellbent on bringing them back in the OT. I am aware Tinker Sue took the Jedi texts. But Yoda says "page turner's they were not!" Really? So all that knowledge and wisdom within those texts bores you master Yoda? They even turned Yoda into an idiot. I guess he was preaching to the idiots that love this trash. Books of knowledge are lame and boring. <br><br><br>Training? Discipline? Knowledge? A Jedi craves not these things! In the Disney era this is absolutely true. What is the point of having a special power or ability if one doesn't even know what to do with it? Or they can use it just by snapping their finger without the training and understanding that comes with it? If you look at MaRey Sue's "arc" what has she overcome? What has she learned about the force? Other than she can use it? So will the future of SW just be a bunch of people that use the force with no training or knowledge? <br><br>Imagine in this new "trilogy" that everyone is using the force just because they all simply believe in it. Never being trained. Never having to overcome obstacles to reach that higher point. That would really make the force special wouldn't it? /S<br><br><br>But this is all made for the lowest common denominator now. That is pretty clear. My interest in SW died in 2015. Before that it was such a happy and great feeling when a new SW movie came out. Now instead of a feeling of joy it is only a feeling of morbid curiosity that I can look at a new SW film.<br><br><br>And if they were to take Kylo Ren and Hux and replaced them with Napoleon Dynamite and Pedro would anyone even be able to tell the difference? I know I wouldn't see it. There is virtually no difference there.<br><br><br>Let's talk about Snoke shall we? One thing I find extremely hilarious is that when MaRey Sue beat Kylo Ren in TFA all the "Reytards" were jumping in defense of this saying that<br><br>"Kylo lost because he isn't the main villain! Snoke is the main villain!" <br><br>But fast forward to TLJ and now Snoke is dead. But NOW the "Reytards" are saying <br><br>"Well who cares who Snoke was? He wasn't even the main villain! Kylo Ren is was the main villain!" <br><br>See? This is what I mean. Because I had to hear for 2 years prior about how Snoke was the main villain and Kylo lost to her in TFA because he was not the main villain. These defenders can't keep their BS story straight here. Because now with Snoke being dead they are all saying<br><br>"Who cares? He was just a nobody anyway!" <br><br>So "Reytards" cognitive dissonance much? <br><br>Reytard= MaRey Sue defenders<br><br><br>And to Rotten Tomatoes Really? How is this trash still holding at 48%? I will admit that I am not sure how this system of scoring works but after reading all the negative reviews with 1 star this score should most likely be lower. Are you guys really that compromised? Please adjust this score accordingly. Your reputation is at stake here. If the audience score is much lower then put the correct score up. This is really making you look bad. Have conviction behind your scoring system. At least you will be doing the right thing. And the right thing is what matters. Because this makes you seem like you are purposefully hiding the real lower score. Don't deceive your members by propping up an inflated score.<br><br><br>Oh and here is just an FYI to all the douche bags whining about "why" others don't like this film<br><br>Read the 1/2-1 star reviews and that will answer your questions! THERE ARE OVER A THOUSAND WELL WRITTEN CRITICISMS OF WHY SOME FOLKS DESPISE THE FILM. If anyone has to ask "why" others don't like it while being able to see plenty of reviews stating the very reasons? Then it really goes to show "why" you morons like this trash! So now I just answered all of those "why don't people like this film?" questions.<br><br>And we have poor old R2 :( He is now basically relegated to the Falcon's lounge as the trash can. Chewie is basically MaRey Sue's lap dog. He doesn't even feel like a co pilot anymore. He is her pet now. And 3PO. Who only exists to be pushed around and ridiculed. It would be great if someone would put all these old school characters out of their misery before this trilogy is over. Because they have to tear down the origianl characters to prop up these hollow one-dimensional cardboard cut outs. The only new actor that will have a career post-ST is Oscar Issac. Ridely and Boyega? They better start thinking of new fields to get into. Because after SW you won't be getting too many phone calls for gigs.<br><br>This film is also made for the libtard mangina's that wear pussy hats while whining for a safe space! Hey you TLJ lovers I want to clue you in on something there are only 2 genders! I know you libtards think there are more than that and you get confused when you have to choose which bathroom to use. So I know why you love TLJ. You are just confused. Libtards are known for being sexually confused. So I know that they would also be confused when it comes to entertainment. My suggestion would be to not wear your pussy hats too tight so that you can see how hollow and void of logic TLJ really is. <br><br>Bots! Bots!Bots! Russia! Russia! Russia Alt-Right! Alt-Right!

 pros:<br>- Looks amazing.<br>- it was nice seeing the original characters again despite how poorly they were treated.<br><br>Cons:<br>- breaks cannon in so many ways that it would take up to much space to list.<br>- ruins all the old characters as well as the new which blows my mind i understand their desire to wipe out the old characters but to ruin their new characters as well is insanity.<br>- Pointless sub plots that serve no purpose at all.<br>- rose and haldo god awful characters.<br>- i like seeing women in star wars but basically the entire bridge crew and every leader/officer was female while the men were down played and made to look foolish and weak and it felt like forced sexism. <br>- Luke drinking milk from a space seahorse cow thing.<br>- since when was fuel a factor in star wars?<br>- weaponized hyperspace nice looking scene but it creates plot holes in every movie past present and future.<br>- fighter bombers removed for the worst assault craft ever created in a sci-fi. Those bombers make 0 sense. They are slow weak large targets carry bombs that ignite other bombs when ignited drop bombs (in space).<br>- yoda looked terrifying and acted like he did in empire when he was toying with luke instead of actually like the real yoda.<br>- phasma wasted she was freaking awesome and you gave her less screen time than that obnoxious haldo character.<br>- snoke dead no knights of ren infact everything set up from the force awakens was thrown out the window. Rian forgot that this is part 2 of 3 and did his own thing as if it was a stand alone movie.<br>- as above it ignored every star wars movie that came before it.<br>- jokes too many awful badly timed scooby doo jokes ruining scenes that could have been good.<br>- bb-8 being more effective than the terminator hes a mech droid not a warrior droid... tone him down a bit.<br>- porgs cute and all and i did like them but they took them too far.<br>- the aliens where are all the original alien species from the cannon? why is every alien new? all the new aliens look almost the same as well same colours same weird beedy eyed yak faced things.<br>- rey downloading the force instead of learning it.<br>- leia poppins.<br>- it breaks the 'unbreakable' laws of space... eg. losing momentum not getting sucked out into space not dying in seconds while exposed to space. It's like having a submarine with a hole in it that doesn't flood.<br>- Kylo flying into the hanger bay while the shields were up since when has that been a thing? Revenge of the sith they had to take out the shields to enter the hanger.<br>- finn and rey had no time together.<br>- rose saving finn that whole scene is just terrible and ruined finns moment.<br>- bigger isn't better everything tries to be bigger better and stronger than what we have seen before.<br>- movie rips off empire strikes back and return of the jedi give us something new please.<br>- seeing ships in orbit and hearing them exit hyperspace from the planets surface.<br>- no emotionally memorable moments: <br>luke dying made me mad it made no sense and was the worst hero death i have ever seen.<br>kylo vs luke was dull and was ruined by the fact luke didn't even show up in person.<br>rey and finn meeting up again... empty.<br>haldo's sacrifice was meh if you didnt make her such a jerk and made her likeable then her sacrifice would have meant more.<br>leia meeting luke again.. zzz.<br>- Music sucked john williams is a genius but this movie just didn't make proper use of his talents. <br><br>Basically the people behind this movies creation have never seen star wars before or thought it was a good idea to destroy the past and start a new instead of building on the amazing foundations laid down for them.<br>- weak weak weak story and plot eg first order takes over the galaxy in what a week?<br>- there are too many cons.<br><br>there are plenty more cons but i think that sums up how bad this movie really is at the core. look beyond the visuals and you'll see how bad it really is.

 Where to begin? Rian Johnson decided that rather than make a decent movie he would make a political statement. The fault lies with Disney for allowing a universally loved franchise to become the topic of such polarizing opinions. <br><br>But hey instead of talking about all of the political messages that were prioritized above the actual story let's talk about said story. So who is Rose Tico and why should we care about her? Why do she and Finn make a pointless trip to the casino? Why does nobody listen to Poe Dameron until it's too late? Why does RJ think that making Luke milk some weird alien only to drink it right in front of us would be funny? Why was Snoke built up only to be killed in such an anticlimactic way in the second movie of the trilogy AND without offering any backstory to why we should have cared about him as a villain. Why is Rey perfect at everything she ever tries without having to practice? Why does RJ feel the need to add such stupid one-liners like having Finn call Phasma "Chrome Dome" during what is supposed to be a tense situation? As bad as the prequel trilogy was (from a dialogue and acting standpoint) there was at least a big-picture story that was well crafted (Minus JarJar). Johnson took the blueprints for what could have been a great trilogy and wiped himself with it... i hate you Rian Johnson. Because of you it is going to take a literal miracle for J.J. Abrams to salvage the trilogy into something even remotely palatable. Honestly though my hopes are not high. For all the fan outrage at how terrible the plot is the Disney team Rian Johnson and even JJ Abrams seem to be stuck on the mindset that to criticize TLJ is to somehow be sexist. As if because we don't like the film we are somehow threatened by a strong female lead. Its arrogance like that which will guarantee that the next episode doesnt see numbers anywhere near the first two with regards to opening weekend. Disney sure has their work cut out for them.

 Reviewed 12.16.17. I've come to a conclusion. It is impossible to please aging Star War's fans. A new installment is never going to mean as much to you as the originals did when you were ten years old. Accept it. At the screening I attended kids loved it. Are these new installments perfect? No. And neither was the original trilogy. Blasphemy? Watch them again critiquing them as you would a new release. They are full of implausible moments and cheesy dialogue too. But they were highly entertaining nonetheless. And so is The Last Jedi. They could have written it a thousand ways. And if I was choosing I'd have done it differently too. But it's as captivating as any of the original movies if you can return to your inner child., 3.5,  Movie M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/975953894/, March 18 2018, N/A

 Wow! This is such an awesome movie! If is one of if not THE BEST movie in the franchise! I really liked this movie for multiple reasons but let's get the biggest ones right off the bat: <br><br> First this movie doesn't follow the average clichés that happen to characters in most movies. For example we expect to see Supreme Leader Snoke to die in this final battle at the end of Star Wars Episode IX but we barely know a thing about him! Besides this kind of storytelling has been used too many times. It's even been used before in this same franchise! So it's a smart decision to go "George R. R. Martin" so to speak on Supreme Leader Snoke and kill him. And they even kill him like Darth Maul in a way! And they did the same thing with Captain Phasma which is about the new saga's equivalent of Boba Fett: barely any lines yet playing a huge role in the movie. She's too overrated so they toss her into the fire and the flames of the ruins of Snoke's battleship. And regarding Rey's parents many many people thought that Luke Skywalker was Rey's father. Or other characters like Obi-Wan Kenobi Han Solo and so forth. But in the end Rey's parents are literal nobodys. They didn't even have names! This is another story aesthetic that makes Star Wars: The Last Jedi a very good movie. Cool! Amazing! Kudos for Rian Johnson! <br><br>Second it emphasizes a feeling of true desperation coming from the protagonists. Usual rebellions in movies are up against this huge unstoppable power but somehow win at almost every turn. Star Wars: The Last Jedi on other hand allows the Resistance a single victory against the Empire. They even emphasize over and over that most of the Resistance fleet has been decimated against Captain Kennedy's First Order Dreadnaught and that the Resistance has been driven from its base at the very beginning a movie. Most of the Resistance dies off completely. Even the Battle of Craig kills off most of the pilots and it's only Luke's force-holographic image at the end of the movie that saves the Resistance. To quote from Leia: "The Resistance is gone. The spark that was to burn down the First Order has gone out." And in addition Luke doesn't even truly activate his lightsaber let alone lay waste to the First Order. He even says in the movie: "You think that I'm just going to come back and strike the First Order down?" Cool! Amazing! Kudos for Rian Johnson! <br><br>Third the usual Mission: Impossible heist that is usually performed in moments of sheer desperation doesn't succeed in The Last Jedi. Instead Finn Rose and BB-8 end up finding a code breaker that they were unaware of instead of the supposed "Master Code-Breaker" that Maz Kannada was advising them towards. And instead of somehow disabling the First Order's power to track the Resistance ships they end up being captured before even reaching the tracking module. Now THAT'S what actually happens in real life most of the time. Cool! Amazing! Kudos for Rian Johnson! <br><br>There are also a ton of other smaller factors that help make this movie one of if not the absolute best installment in the franchise. Factors like these include things like: <br>Humorous jokes that lightened up the mood of the audience. <br>Memorable storyline for a movie like Star Wars. <br>Stunning visuals unmatched by any previous Star Wars movie. <br>It's like the Empire Strikes Back: it's no "good-guys-constantly-win" movie. <br>The poetry it tells as Luke's life comes to a close as it shows almost the exact same sunset that Luke watches as he is just a baby at the end of Revenge of the Sith and when he was at the verge of discovering the Force. The only difference is the location. <br>Besides like I said earlier it's just like the Empire Strikes back which critics consider to be the best film in the franchise until The Last Jedi started rolling around the movie theaters. <br><br> Cool! Amazing! Kudos for Rian Johnson! <br><br> <br> And yes there are rooms for improvement. It could still be a bit shorter (especially with the casino scene) and many parts of the story could be fleshed out more but it's still much more PRO than CON. <br><br> <br><br> So if you don't like The Last Jedi that probably means that you were more used to events like A New Hope and Return of the Jedi where happy endings continue popping up again and again. I'm not saying that that's a bad storytelling element: I personally love A New Hope and The Last Jedi. But if that sort of repeat scenario happens again as it did in The Force Awakens (also an extremely good movie) the creators of The Last Jedi would be leaving the storytelling with too few loose ends to tie up in Star Wars: Episode IX. In addition a lot of the audience would be rather bored with the "good-guys-always-winning-despite-the-fact-that-they-are-completely-outmatched-by-the-opposing-force" scenario. <br><br> We should not trash this kind of story.

AGAIN I STRESS EQUALITY. EPISODE 7 DID A GREAT JOB BY SUBTLY AND FAIRLY GIVING OUT IMPORTANT ROLES FOR PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT RACES GENDERS ETC. I AM ALL FOR FEMALE HEROES AS LONG AS THEY ARE WELL FONE CHARACTERS. AND IN A SAGA AS STAR WARS WE HAVE PLENTY OF ROOM TO LIVE WITH THE STRUGGLES OF THE MAIN CHARACTERS AN VILAINS AND UNDERTAND THEIR MOTIVATIONS. EPISODE 7 ACHIEVED A GOOD EEQUILIBRIUM BY NOT SLAPPING PEOPLE IN THE FACE WITH "AGENDAS" WHILE STILL SERVIING SOCIAL ISSUES OF EQUALITY AND FAIRNESS. BUT THEN EPISODE COMES IN AND DESTROYS ALL THIS AND INSTEAD THINKS IT'S BEST TO BREAK EQUALITY AND SLAP EVERY SINGLE MALE CHARACTER IN THE FACE INSULT THEM AND PORTRAY THEM AS WEAK (LUKE) VIOLENT AND UNHINGED (POE) COWARD (LUKE) TROUBLED (KYLO) MANIACS (HUCKS) PURE EVIL YET STUPID (SNOKE) INSIGNIFICANT (ACKBAR) NO HEROIC ACTION ALLOWED (FINN).... WHILE ALMOST EVERY SINGLE FEMALE CHARACTER WAS PORTRAYED AS SOME VIRTUOUS SUPERHERO WHO IS ALWAYS RIGHT NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO: LEIA (SUPERMAN POWERS WITH NO EXPLANATION) - HOLDO (SHE IS ALWAYS RIGHT EVEN IF AS A FIRST TIME LEADER REFUSES TO SHARE THE PLAN WITH HER OFFICERS BUT HEY SHE IS A WOMAN AND HAS TO BE OBEYED WITHOUT QUESTIONING HER MOTIVATIONS) REY (VIRTUALLY UNTRAINED IN THE FORCE LEARNS VERY LITTLE FROM LUKE IN 2 DAYS BECOMES THE MOST POWERFUL HUMAN BEING IN THE UNIVERSE) ROSE (STEALS FINN'S HEROIC MOMENT ATTEMPTING TO SAVE EVERYBODY BECAUSE SHE LOVES HIM WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN SAVING EVERYBODY BECAUSE REASONS).<br><br>4- The first characters to be disrespected were the female characters despite the movie obviously pushing the agenda of feminism (not the Equality feminist movement but the All men are stupid feminist movement). Since they removed any real struggle and arc from the main hero Rey. She didn't earn any of her powers she didn't work for it. She was practically handed super powers because the force needs to "balance itself" ?!? Since when the force works like that in Star Wars ? Luke had to train for weeks or months with the most powerful Jedi in the universe (Yoda) in order to finally be able to summon a lightsaber from distance barely. But Miss Rey untrained in any way somehow becomes this all powerful and virtuous being just because of some silly mental bridge between her and Kylo ? <br>Admiral Holdo had the potential to be a good interesting character instead she was portrayed as this incompetent leader who has poor communication skills who refuses to share SURVIVAL plans because she thinks that her Top officer is a violent asshole. Thus forcing Poe who naturally thought she was crazy as most the audience did and hatched a plan to save the day which opened the door to an unnecessary subplot for Finn and Rose why ? because we have to fill in the Asian quota and give her something to do even if it didn't make any sense... because the writers are so incompetent that they cannot even write in something that makes sense to the story for the Asian girl... No let's give her the most ridiculous and long plot and use this to lecture the audience that War = Bad War = rich men get richer... WOW ! what a revelation ! Oh and let's also save the animals because our friends who are about to die can wait. It's not like these animals will be recaptured by the rich bad people anyway !! <br><br>5- The movie is riddled by severe amounts of physically impossible situations to count a few: Leia supermans back into a ship which has lost it's air pressure then the door was open and laws of physics get suspended and nobody gets sucked into the vacuum of space like what just happened moments earlier when physics still applied ! <br>The whole boring chase sequence made no sense fuel conservation mega ships unable to hit LASERS that far to hit the target ? Super duper mega ships cannot go a little faster to catch up and fire at range? <br>Single tiny enemy ship able to distract mega super ship and its commander by using bad phone line jokes instead of Mega ship obliterating the tiny ship at first sight ? <br>Etc etc. <br><br>6- Movie goes against all what Luke Skywalker stands for. The man who didn't give up on his father the most evil being in the universe and insisted on saving him against all odds freaks out because his nephew had some dark force brewing in him ? and considers for a few seconds to kill him ? what ? are you joking movie ? That's the reason Luke then fled away like a chicken ? Luke who is established as one of the most powerful Jedis in history ?!? Have the writers even watched Star Wars ? are they aware of the Star Wars Lore ? I bet not. Because all they care for is take advantage of the biggest Franchise in history and lecture people about their personal opinions. <br>I would've loved to see Luke in a weakened state and going through another terrible trial which exhausted him but for GOOD REASONS !!! Not for this lazy stupid reason that was slapped in our face ! <br><br>7- I have plenty of things still to say but this has been a long review and there is still plenty from unnecessary bad jokes to horrible character motivations etc... But I shall stop here.<br>And I will Only ask Lucasfilm and Disney to please listen to your large fan base those who actually watch the movies several times those who buy all your merchandise because the overwhelming majority hated this movie and this means your sales will go down and they have gone down. Instead of pandering to some niche audience who would clap at anything that is aligned with their personal opinions but would never watch the movie more than once and will never bother to buy any of our merchandise. Think about what you are doing to yourselves to this Franchise to the fans. <br>Please consider course correction stop slapping personal social opinions in SCIENCE FICTION ENTERTAINING MOVIES in our faces. Pass whatever messages you want for people to ponder upon without lecturing us like babies and without destroying the storytelling in the process. It isn't that hard.<br>Thank you, 1.0,  Darth M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977173369/, March 19 2018, N/A
 Admiral Ackbar...with a whimper like some pedestrian after thought. Yeah the new material was clearly meant to expand to the younger generation and profitable demographics it's just sad that they had to pull the rug under the old fanbase by making most novels and comics and other lores non canon. I hope Disney reinserts them soon. It's like being stripped bare naked. Old fans have so little to cherish and remember about the Expanded Universe with this abrupt and rushed passing of the torch. More so is this true after the burning of the Jedi texts sanctioned by no one else but a Jedi legend (conveniently) through Disney's orchestrations to ensure a clear path for its own Star Wars Universe. I look forward to having Luke serve as that Force ghost who has all the knowledge of the legends myths history and lore in his head like a gate keeper and that we'll see more of him in future installments because clearly us old fans need someone we can hold on to with this SW franchise starship going lightspeed without the old guard., 0.5,  Earl M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/887527572/, March 19 2018, N/A

 Sigh. It's not good. I'm baffled by the critic reviews being largely positive. <br>Disney did not deliver to the fans. That's a reasonable criticism. I've heard plenty of folks retort with remarks like "but Rian Johnson was trying to do something different" and "the dyed-in-the-wool fans didn't like out because nothing could please them their original star wars is sacred and they're closed - minded."<br>Let's dispense with the BS. <br>This movie was bad. Objectively bad. It attempted to do good things. But it failed. Miserably.<br>Let's talk about the validity of criticisms to Johnson failing to pay lol service to fans. <br>Let's talk about Luke. Holy shit did Johnson fail with Luke. The internet memes say it all: "there's still good in you father I don't let the dark side take you fully" versus "I saw some darkness in you nephew and I'm gonna kill you before you do anything! JK! But I'm not going to try to save you now that you've fallen to the dark side. How is THAT consistent with my character?" <br>It isn't. It was lame. Luke in this movie didn't resemble the Luke we knew from days of old. Not even a little.<br>Luke's death? Crap. Total cop out lazy and even if it wasn't super predictable. I get it Johnson set it all up for us yay. But it was stupid. <br>Let's talk about the casino scene. <br>W.T.F.? That scene was a hot mess. The social commentary was thicker than bantha shit: materialism and power struggles cause war and capitalism is everything wrong with the universe blah blah blah. Yeah really deep. <br>I haven't even mentioned the fact that the whole movie is basically a car chase in super slow motion. I get that the waa a chase in Empire Strikes Back and this harkened to that. But that had tension and was more cat and mouse. This chase was more like that scene in Austin Powers the one with the steam roller.<br>The lines were shit and sounded like they were written by a high schooler. The technobabble between rose and finn didn't make any sense not because it was technobabble but because they were technobabbling about an obviously shoehorned-in plot device and a lame one at that. <br>Yoda sucked and he was the highlight. And where the fuck has he been all this time Luke has been moping around Ach-To? Just watching the galaxy go to shit while the most powerful Jedi felt sorry for himself? Fucking ridiculous. Did anyone think about this shit before deciding to put it on screen? Seriously you could have dangled a bongo in front of a beatnik and gotten a better script out of him. <br>What. The.

 It's an impossible task making a movie for the nit-pickiest audience in all of film but Rian Johnson and co. really missed the mark here.<br><br>Trying so hard to dodge all fan predictions before the film released led to some twists and reveals that were plain boring and disappointing. Of course had some of the predictions that fans made turned out to be true it might have been construed as "fan service" or "pandering" but it certainly would have been a whole lot better than the movie we ended up getting.<br><br>Story aside it's a visually impressive movie (No surprise there I guess.) The space sequences are some of the most memorable in the franchise. The Climactic Lightsaber battle sees a bit of a modification in this episode.<br><br>The movie is needlessly long. There's a story line involving finn and new character rose that makes you wish both had died before the credits rolled. (Which may sound harsh but just watch the movie.)<br><br>In the end this movie is at least better than "Phantom" and "Clones" but that's it., 3.0,  JD M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/915694200/, March 18 2018, N/A

 Plot holes. Too many jokes trying to compete with marvel or other superhero movies in those terms. Luke's character was destroyed and Leia scene was one of the worst ideas in star wars.

 La peor peli de star wars. Aqui estan sus errores:<br>Esta pelicula (ep8) para mi fue una de las peores. Hay muchas razones por las que digo esto. Va mas alla de los personajes la trama misma de la pelicula es malisima y llena de errores. PUNTO 1: Luke. El es un personaje muy querido por los fans por eso la gente en general no le gusto su cambio. Pero lo voy a enfocar desde un punto mas tecnico que sentimental. Desde mi punto de vista el cambio que experimenta Luke es por el intento de asesinato a ben solo. Pero cuanto mas lo pienso menos sentido tiene para mi. Luke en el ep 6 perdona a vader (un lord sith que ya habia asesinado a mucha gente) y hasta se niega a matarlo. Pero aqui intenta matar a SU SOBRINO por algo que no paso. Ese no es el luke que yo conozco. Y aun peor en lugar de intentar remediar su error se va a esconderse sin que le importe nada (osea vamos en el ep5 luke corre a por sus amigos. pero aqui simplemente los abandona y los deja morir. TODA la galaxia estaba en peligro y a el no le importa). PUNTO 2: La trama de la persecusion a la resistencia. Porfavor si un par de cazas destruyeron el puente ¿Por que no enviar mas?. Los destructores normales son MUCHO mas rapidos que la nave gigante de snoke podrian haber alcanzado a la resistencia sin problemas. O la primera orden podria haber enviado destructores desde otro punto de la galaxia para que intercepten a la resistencia (sinceramente no creo que TODA la primera orden estuviera persiguiendo a la resistencia seguro tenian mas naves). PUNTO 3: Los poderes en la fuerza: mire una explicacion de ese poder de clon de luke en otro canal pero me sigue pareciendo fuera de lugar. Mi principal queja es el poder de Snoke de jugar con ray como si de un jugete se tratase. La levanta la manda para alla y luego para aqui y la sube y la baja y pareciera que estuviera moviendo una pluma. Osea si mover a una persona es tan facil ¿Porque sidious no lo uso con luke o vader? Y si snoke es tan poderoso porque murio a los 5 minutos de aparecer. PUNTO 4: Los chistes. Yo creo que se pasaron osea hay demasiados chistes. Unos pocos (como los que hay en rouge one con K2ESO) esta bien. Pero cuando pones tantos ya no molan. Se sienten fuera de la peli (osea los guardianes del templo solo estan para hacer chistes con ray y encima los chistes son del calibre de un niño de 5 años: caidas golpes y ect). Pero esta es solo mi opinion si has llegado aqui te doy las gracias por leer mi discurso.

 I don't like the Holdo character because Poe is right to be worried and the decision of not tell the plan even when she is threated her is very stupid I like the Finn and Rose mission very much I think it shows another interesting point of view I don't think luke has a good reason to say the jedi must end even if Luke thinks like that now he would resolve his mistake and then go to exile but the truth is that a jedi would never do that and least Luke i think the Rey and Kylo arc is very interesting Yoda shows very later when he could show sooner captain phasma and snoke are the worst and useless characters in the star wars saga and now it happens anyone can be a jedi just with being strong with the force and move a lightsaber a little all felt in the sensation that has to be awesome but it happens to be very absurd, 3.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977171885/, March 18 2018, N/A

 This movie was absolute garbage. And it's not even about the stupid politics. That didn't even start bothering me until 3 or 4 days later when it got tiresome listening to all the fans endlessly talking about it and blaming my dislike of the film on politics. No.. the film was just crap. It was boring. The characters all sucked. What they did to Luke was unforgivable. They destroyed everything set up in The Force Awakens which itself wasn't even a good film but it was a lot better than this trainwreck. After near 40 years of loving Star Wars this film has single handedly destroyed every positive feeling I had left for this franchise. I am not interested in Solo. I will not go see episode 9.

 The plot holes are massive and the movie destroys the best elements of the original movies. I went to this film with such hope because there were so much plot points that could be developed. However disapointment ensued where any vestige of hope resided. Also one of my main complaints is the situational premise of the start of the film: Two ships in the vacuum of space both ships travelling at "top speed" how is it possible that one ship is in danger of catching up with the other? I understand that this is fantasy but I can't help but think that some basic science should be applied.

 Dear Disney: the Last Jedi was a poor film. Poorly written and a strained film. Instead of listening to film critics who are paid by studios listen to the majority of the fans who didn't like the film. Fan rating on rotten tomatoes is 48%. That is worse than a Phantom menace. And in a recent interview Mark Hamill agreed that the vision of Colin Treverrow was better:<br><br>"I had discussions with Colin. I was very excited because we were on the same page in terms of where we wanted to go and how we wanted to see Luke in a way that we never seen him. Even in this current version.

 Horrible film. Ruined the character of Luke full of plot holes and dropped story lines from last film. Makes it harder to like SW 7. Rey is a empty character with no arc. The plot of the movie is illogical and consquently bogs down the film with pointless subplots. Wasted characters repeated scenes and dialogue from orig trig. Tone of the film inconsistant dramatic moments ruined by ham fisted low brow humor. If you follow the quick and easy path you will become an agent of evil. Don't bother to write an original story with characters that need each other and develop their skills and grow through experience (or being trained) not just gifted everything and you end up with a corporate cash grab piece of trash.

 Star Wars has been turned into a comedy without a coherent plot line and a complete dismantling od the original characters. They turned our heroes (Han Lea and Luke) into forgotten senior citizens. Chewy a once beloved sidekick disregarded as though he had no place in history. These movies could certainly paved the way for new characters without turning Han into a bumbling fool after saving the galaxy twice. He could've gone out in a blaze of glory. Our beloved Princess turned into Marry Poppins. Our Last of the Jedi Luke into a grumpy old troll. So they could've gone. Even if you attempted to be open to what they've done here the characters they created Snoke for example turned out to be a nobody. At least that's how he was treated. Two years worth of theories thrown around by the deepest Star Wars fans of many generations tossed out like trash. <br>Right now I'd be happy to take one of the most outrageous theories over the rediculous circus.

 This definitely "feels" like a star wars movie. Well most of the time. There are a few sequences that remove the "star wars element." Rey is still overpowered with no explanation. Luke is completely different from how he was in the previous movies. Chalk it up to old age I guess. The bad guys are not really bad. They are weak pathetic and hardly any threat. The fight scenes are mostly garbage this is because Disney doesn't know how to handle fight scenes like at all. Fin is totally pointless as usual. A new character is introduced Rose. She is inserted for diversity purposes exclusively and serves absolutely no purpose to the plot. All in all not worth seeing., 2.5,  Dean S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/914910876/, March 19 2018, N/A
 I have loved Star Wars for years. I really like TFA and loved Rogue One and wanted to love this one so much. I completely hated this movie. This is just a bad movie. First mistake was having three different directors and writers. Movie doesn't follow anything that was set up in the first movie not coherent story telling at all. Even as a stand alone movie it would be bad. The main plot of a chase is space because the rebels ran out of gas is ridiculous. The timeline is a mess and it in so many ways for those trying to say it is new and fresh is just a rehash of portions of the original three movies except done poorly. This movie is a prime example of just trying to be different or edgy for the sake of being different and edgy. The "surprises" were lame at best and hurt the overall story. This movie actually makes the TFA look worse. There was no purpose to this movie but to kill off luke is the worst way possible. JJ has his work cut out for him. To be honest If they were to announce they were not going to make the next one I would be happy. Tme to leave this universe. I will most certainly never see another movie that has Rian Johnson's name anywhere near it. He is a completely thoughtless train wreck of a writer and director., 1.0,  Aaron V, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976949045/, March 19 2018, N/A

 It was terrible. Like all of JJ Abrams recent films it was pretty and shiny but lacked memorable characters storylines dialogue and depth. I could make a movie twice as good with half the money and I've never studied film. When this movie comes on TV in a few years time you won't care to watch it. A jumbled mess made out of a dumpster fire of childhood memories and ham-fisted attempts at audience emotional manipulation.

 It's better than ep. 7 for sure and is strong in some areas but falls flat on its face in others. It's my opinion that Luke Skywalker was done 100% dirty in the way the character was written this time around. This version of Luke had nothing to do with the Luke we all know and love. The casino side-story was pretty pointless and did nothing for the plot. Also that battle scene was a pretty obscene rip-off the battle in ep. 5. Is there no such thing as creativity anymore?

 The first time I saw this movie I couldn't really review it properly I needed more time I needed to see it again. Truth be told I disliked it on my first viewing...but there were elements I liked. Surely this couldn't be strike two for the new Star Wars trilogy? (I disliked 'The Force Awakens' also). Well this was my second viewing and I now feel I can get into this fully. Thing is there is literally so much I could say about this movie it could possibly go on and on. So this time I'm gonna go with a slightly new layout. I'm simply gonna list my thoughts in sections and try to keep them as tight as possible.<br><br>General Hux and the beginning: Twas this opening sequence that really bemused and worried me right away (as it did with many). Hux was a relatively solid slimy character introduced in the previous movie. All the trappings of a weaselly baddie. Alas here he has seemingly been reduced to an actual jokey comedic character that could so easily have been torn from the pages of a spoof. The first real dialog we get is an absolutely horrendous back and forth between Hux and Poe. Poe mocking Hux with his communications tomfoolery or as we in reality call it a lame mobile (cell) phone gag.<br><br>Poe bravely tries to bring down a First Order (Empire) dreadnought during the first space battle. Unfortunately things aren't going too well and the Resistance (Rebels) are being slaughtered. The rebels have one last bomber and one chance to hit their target. In the nick of time the rebel pilot is able to drop the bombs but how can bombs 'drop' when in space? What about TIE Bombers you say? Well I always thought TIE Bombers fired their bombs downward like torpedoes essentially but straight down. That's just me. Also if you look closely the bomber hangar doors are already open when the pilot triggers the bombs. How was she not sucked out into space?<br><br>Princess Leia: Oh boy! Oh boy oh boy oh boy! We've all heard about this now but I can't just ignore it. Yes we know Leia has force abilities (as we saw in Bespin) and we know its entirely possible she has grown stronger with the force since then. That aside its still almost impossible to get past how stupid this entire sequence looked and felt. To make matters even worse when she flies/floats back to the ship there was no airlock. The rebels simply open the flippin' door! Everyone would have been sucked out into space in a matter of seconds for flips sake. Oh and while we're at it she suffered absolutely no injuries whilst getting blown out of the exploding ships bridge. No burns cuts broken bones nothing. I'm not even sure how those TIE torpedoes got through the ships shields I guess they were special torpedoes?<br><br>Then there is of course the flip side to this stupid scene. Unfortunately Carrie Fisher died in 2016 which naturally caused issues for the film. This scene was the perfect ending for Princess Leia under these circumstances. The fact that Fisher is no longer with us surely cemented that. But apparently not apparently Johnson thought it better to bring her back and give the next director a real headache. The only thing I can think of is they have a large amount of pre-shot footage which they know they can flesh out into the next story. But if that's the case it sure as hell limits things drastically. Oh and they also killed Admiral Ackbar off-screen here too you bastards!<br><br>Anch-To and Luke: Adrift in a cold sea on an oceanic planet this small windswept circular rocky island houses the first Jedi temple and the tree library of the sacred Jedi texts. The inhabitants of this small island? Small cutesy flightless (I think) bird-like creatures that get everywhere. And 'the caretakers' dwarf sized toad-like creatures that appear to dress like century old nuns. Both races are completely unexplained and are completely useless to the plot. The Porgs merely serve as fluffy comedic relief whilst the caretakers look like they belong in a 'Labyrinth' sequel. The only creature we briefly see that grabbed my attention was the sea monster breaking the surface in the background.<br><br>As with the Leia controversy I'm sure everyone now knows about the Luke controversy. Apart from milking large alien sea mammals for blue milk and generally being a grouch there was also the lightsaber tossing moment. I'm not gonna dwell on it...but yes it was totally a 'fuck you' to the fanbase from director Rian Johnson. It was also a pathetic Disneyfied attempt at light humour. They basically used a powerful emotional moment in the plot for a quick laugh. Oh it was a plot twist you say? Keep em'.<br><br>Canto Bight: Ugh! Sorry just raising my head outta my hands. Well I guess if anyone wanted something more akin to a Lucas movie this was it. Alas more akin to the worst of the Lucas prequels. Yep this entire subplot was completely unnecessary and really ugly looking. A super rich casino city located on planet Cantonica its packed with super rich alien lifeforms and humans (most of whom appeared to be white? Even all the city police were white men interesting). Anyway this was the segment where Johnson (under orders of Disney I assume) added the core liberal commentary on our present day society. War profiteering animal cruelty slavery etc...its all here all the juicy stuff. Unfortunately most average people don't wanna see this kind of stuff crowbarred into a Star Wars movie not so blatantly for no real reason anyway. At least try with some flippin' subtly. It was really no surprise that this subplot surrounded the new character of Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) who herself was the epitome of a token politically correct character.<br><br>DJ (Benicio del Toro): Another very pointless character if you ask me. Stupid name stupid way of talking. I suppose he's the Lando of the movie I wouldn't be surprised if he pops up again. Main question surrounding him I wonder just who did that ship he pinched belong to. The owner of which was selling ships to both the Resistance and First Order. A possible set up for later on?<br><br>Snoke: So he dies yeah that went nowhere or so we think. I didn't mind that he died (a decent twist for me) but the way it happened seemed silly to me. This bloke is all powerful with the dark side but couldn't detect Kylo Ren moving a lightsaber that was inches from his person?? I guess Kylo could have clouded his mind or whatever but wouldn't he detect that too? I dunno. Plus his personal guards seemed to be useless. Rey showing her invincibility again...despite being revealed as a nobody. Oh and neither Rey nor Kylo actually use any force powers in that fight eh?<br><br>Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern): In short a very unlikeable character who looked like a middle aged woman having a midlife crisis (the purple hair). At first it literally seemed like she was just there to put the men (the flyboys) in their place with a show of Disney backed feminism (anyone else notice that both the Resistance and First Order seem to have had a major female recruitment campaigns? I'm fine with the ladies in here but Jesus talk about beyond obvious). Amazingly it turns out that Poe's plans were the wrong route after all and Holdo was in fact correct (another decent twist). The problem is by the time this happens I was so against Holdo that it just didn't matter anymore. They made her so unlikeable that it was too late to turn that around. Oh and all this technology but a major ship doesn't have autopilot? Really?<br><br>Yoda: Very cool (hehe) but why not Ben? Or Anakin? Or Qui-Gon? And force ghosts can now do stuff? They can make things happen in the realms of the living? And again another case of Johnson trying to throw out Star Wars lore and legend by having Yoda destroy the Jedi texts (although we see later they weren't...somehow).<br><br>Crait: Ah the Hoth battle bit. I guess it was too hard for Johnson and co not to copy the original trilogy. Seeing as before this we had a copy of the Emperor's throne room with Luke from 'Return of the Jedi' (Kylo Rey and Snoke). And a copy of the asteroid sequence with the Falcon from 'Empire Strikes Back' (Falcon in the Crait caves). Anyway this time the Resistance have about 15 people left (although in the next shot we see dozens more soldiers outta nowhere) and they're up against an even bigger force from the First Order. Same layout as before the Resistance base door behind a long trench with a few gun turrets. <br><br>Salt!: Yes that's right random Resistance fighter #5 luckily points out for us that the surface of Crait (or that area) is covered in salt. Just in case you mistook it for snow. You know just in case you thought they were trying to copy the Hoth battle (insert eye roll here). Thing is why did he do that? He could of killed himself its an alien planet you don't just stick random things in your mouth for Pete's sake. Is this the new Ridley Scott method of alien world exploration?<br><br>The First Order use around 10 brand new AT-M6 walkers (with a few older AT-AT's for some reason) TIE's Kylo's shuttle and superlaser siege cannon. The Resistance use these old speeders (V-4X-D) which required a sort of rudder that stabilised them. I guess they must have been very old designs? The battle is indeed a fun highlight but is utterly stupid as the goodies should of been wiped out in minutes. In fact its so stupid I'm not even sure what they were attempting to do with those speeders. They certainly didn't have firepower to take on the walkers and they couldn't shoot at the TIE's. Its also here where Finn should of died in an emotional sacrificial moment of heroism...but he's saved by that idiot Rose which in turn gave the First Order the victory. Obviously Disney weren't ever gonna kill off their main minority actors pish posh!<br><br>Luke (again): So Luke dies...but why? It is shown Luke is using force projection to confront Kylo (a controversial aspect in itself). Are we to presume he was exhausted after using this power? So much so that he died? Maybe this ability is so powerful that it drains the users life force. Maybe that's why we've never seen it before? Maybe only the strongest most force sensitive Jedi can do it? Kinda makes you wonder why no one has ever used it before. Ben Kenobi could have used it against Vader when confronting him on the Death Star (if strong enough). Ditto Yoda against Count Dooku etc...Also have to ask why he projected himself looking younger for Leia's sake?<br><br>To sum up looking closer this is really 'Empire Strikes Back' its just not as obvious. Rebels discovered Rebels run away Rebels pursued Rebels lose in the end. What's funny is most of this movie is in fact a very slow chase between two very slow moving ships. And this is the first time we've heard about fuel issues in Star Wars also. A few other final little things. Phasma what was the point? (and why don't all troopers wear her laser proof armour yet?). Nien Nunb's mask still doesn't look as good as the 83 version how???!!! What the hell was all that crap with multiple Rey's in that hole? And what was that hole suppose to be? (other than another scene copied from EST. Luke in the cave on Dagobah). And the final sequence with that kid and his broom kinda felt like another prequel-esque moment. Is this kid gonna be important?<br><br>Did I like this new Star Wars movie? No I liked bits and when I say bits I mean bits. I liked the visuals they were generally a massive improvement over 'The Force Awakens'. I genuinely loved the small chase sequence inside a huge Crait cave with TIE's hot on the Falcon's tail. Not only did this look great it had some classic Chewie piloting moments plus some actual amusing interactions with the Porgs (dunno why Chewie would allow them to stay on the ship but whatever). The fact this sequence also had some John Williams classic Star Wars score along with it almost brought me to tears. I liked Snoke and his death (yup). Twas cool to see a big baddie go down so quickly and easily unique. I also liked the First Order presence on Crait as it looked badass alas nothing much happens with it. <br><br>But overall I was again disappointed with the final product [b]although[/b] I will say I did enjoy it just that little more than 'The Force Awakens'. I'm really not so sure what they're gonna do going forward and the fact Abrams is back doesn't fill me with confidence., 2.5, , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/789814099/, March 19 2018, Super-reviewer
 The Last Jedi is a shockingly bad film they left me deflated and bitterly disappointed. The depiction of Luke Skywalker as a depressed defeated and fearful has-been was something I cannot accept. Rian Johnson took the greatest hero of modern times and reduced him to a homeless bum. Mark Hamill is a brilliant actor. He deserves better than this. And so did the fans..., ni,  Adam A, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977173867/, March 19 2018, N/A
 "The Last Jedi" was essentially a slow boring toy advertisement. In episode 8 we discover somehow the Rebellion has been gone from a fighting force that has destroyed three Imperial planet-killing bases to a tiny band in three inconsequential ships. It quickly becomes clear that it was due to Poe's piss poor leadership. Meanwhile Finn's storyline literally did nothing to advance the plot while Rey made shadowpuppets with Bed from across the galaxy.

 I consider myself a fan of all these movies to a degree especially the first three but this one did the series reputation no favours. Even my 11yr old was not interested. It tries hard to find the connection that A New Hope was able to develop with the characters but fails. I felt nothing for them. Even the funny scenes did not make me laugh.

 Not going to buy this movie cause seeing it once was enough. Why is it so hard in this age to make interesting characters and not write plot holes the size of caverns? I thought the Force Awakens set up a great dynamic between Rey Poe and Fin. There was this mysterious evil in the name of supreme leader snoke and a search for Luke Skywalker that was worth risking lives for. Turns out Luke is sitting in a cave drinking alien cow-milk full of regrets but he shows up in the end to say goodbye to the franchise in a BS way. There's so much wrong with the characters in this movie that could've been great. And the plot twists are just awful in this movie.

 The Last Jedi is a beautiful disaster of a Star Wars film with plenty to admire and plenty to despise.<br><br>I'll start with the good. Rian Johnson's film oozes style throughout. The visual and sound effects are top notch and I wanted to stop the movie rewind and re-watch some shots just to appreciate the artistry that went into them. Rian Johnson is phenomenal at crafting scenes and most of the scenes he makes stand well on their own merits. The acting is for the most part excellent and Mark Hamill easily steals the show throwing himself into a role despite the actor's very public misgivings about the director's choices. <br>There are some elements that are just kind of there. The musical score is mostly recycled from previous movies with no memorable new songs while I enjoy the musical heritage of Star Wars I was mildly disappointed with the lack of any compelling or iconic new theme with this movie. The Last Jedi strongly features alien animals like the baby penguin-like porgs the crystal foxes and the racing animals these are visually interesting but add nothing of consequence to the movie. Humor has been dialed up a lot in this movie to the point where it becomes an end in itself rather than the kind of character-building banter seen between the leads in previous movies this works for some people and doesn't work for others.<br>Where The Last Jedi goes wrong is with its writing and storytelling. Rian Johnson is great at crafting shots and scenes but he stumbles badly at assembling these into a coherent story. The movie suffers from pacing issues and irrelevant plotlines and it frequently fails to obey its own logic let alone the precedents of previous Star Wars movies. While these failings would be tolerated in an unrelated science fiction movie The Last Jedi is supposed to be a Star Wars Saga movie and The Last Jedi truly falls on its face as a Star Wars movie. Johnson built this movie from the ground up to break expectations and the movie accomplishes this but it does so by flagrantly disregarding and actively invalidating the setting characters narrative structures and setups of the previous Star Wars movies. Here are some examples: (MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD) <br>Luke Skywalker the man who risked everything to bring out the good in Darth Vader decided to murder his nephew in his sleep because he sensed the possibility of evil within him. Then he runs away to sulk as a hermit for the rest of his life and destroy what little legacy is left of the Jedi. No explanation is given for these radical changes in Luke's character.<br>A mighty fleet is destroyed by a single rebel cruiser doing a kamikaze attack using hyperspace. This tactic is shown to be so powerful that it unwittingly invalidates the plot of almost every Star Wars movie made to date. What's the point of building a Death Star when a hyperdrive on a rock could smash a planet? What's the point of finding a weakness to the Death Star when a hyperdrive and a rock could destroy it? Why worry about an enemy fleet when a hyperdrive and a rock could wipe it out? No explanation is given of why this tactic works or why it hasn't been done before.<br>Rey becomes a fully trained Jedi Knight with essentially no training whatsoever in this movie. Contrast this with the rest of the saga. Luke Skywalker learned the ways of the force from two Jedi masters and spent a significant amount of time and effort doing so. This was an exceptional case Jedi in previous movies are described as beginning their training at a very young age. <br>Heroic sacrifice to destroy a great threat and save one's friends is regarded as a good thing in Star Wars up until this movie. In this movie a character is berated and demoted for doing this. Then the same people who berated and demoted the character do the same thing and are portrayed as being wise and righteous. The only apparent difference between the bad heroic sacrifice move and the good one is the gender of the person making the heroic sacrifice. Given the public statements from Lucasfilm's president and both directors of this Star Wars trilogy this is a very deliberate distinction that stems from their very public political philosophies. <br>Star Wars has always made allegories to historical political events and movements to aid its storytelling. Imperial officer uniforms are based on Nazi SS uniforms the original Star Destroyers were meant to invoke Teddy Roosevelt's White Fleet and its global show of force and the Death Star was meant to invoke the destructive power of nuclear weapons. The Last Jedi inverts this by using its story to issue overt judgments on modern political issues such as the evils of greedy capitalism gambling and animal/child exploitation. On an ironic side note the Star Wars video game EABattlefront II which was timed to coincide with this movie's release has been publicly lambasted for its greedy business practices and gambling mechanics in a game targeted at children. <br>The Force Awakens set up many mysteries for fans to ponder: Rey's lineage Snoke's origins and motives the Knights of Ren and Luke's lightsaber to name a few. Johnson either ignores these setups or dismisses them with disdain. The effect is jarring and smatters of a lack of a coherent over-arching story. In a sequel film that is supposed to set up another sequel this is a problem. <br>These rejections of what have come before aren't likely to bother people who aren't fans of Star Wars and even among fans of Star Wars those who subscribe to the philosophy of postmodernism and enjoy deconstructing social constructs seem to love it. Among fans who care about these story elements however this movie's deconstructionist approach comes across as sophomoric and trolling. <br>Rian Johnson was so determined to break the setting's conventions that he broke the setting itself. In his eagerness to take the franchise in a new direction he tore down everything and replaced it with nothing. The Last Jedi was a celebration of nihilism and if that's where Disney is taking Star Wars then I want no part of its future., 2.0,  Hotrod C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977175128/, March 20 2018, N/A

 This movie... I am not sure about. <br>While there were some great moments in this there where also some big mistakes and bad things in it too. <br>First of all: I don't care about politics but I hate it when someones agenda is pushed into my face while I just want to enjoy the movie. <br>The whole scene with Rose on that casino planet was so dumb. <br>Speaking of Rose: that character should not exist. Nothing against the actor but the character was pointless and useless in the whole story. The Jar Jar Binks of the sequel trilogy. <br><br>The rest of the movie was alright to me altough they dismissed a lot of mysteries from the previous movies. <br>The effects where nice the action was good. Luke's performance was fun. <br>There where funny jokes here and there and some interresting designs for new creatures. <br><br>I am still looking forward to episode IX especially now JJ Abrams is coming back. <br>I give this movie 3 stars out of 5. <br>My advice to Lucas Arts: keep Kathleen Kennedy away from Star Wars. <br>We don't need feminism in the enternainment industry.

 What poor storytelling. None of the plot points from the first instalment were elaborated on which was very disappointing. Its like it was written by a different person - oh wait it was.... Pacing was terrible and the story just did not flow. The humour seemed forced corny and out of place in the star wars universe. My biggest problem is that there was no character development from the previous movie and that there were major holes in the plot. New characters were introduced but they were not interesting at all. I remember thinking during the film that the final act could redeem the film (i was being hopeful) but alas it was a big let down as well. All in all a major disappointment. Some of the visuals were impressive though.

 From what I've in excerpts and reviews of this movie. I refuse to accept it as an official Star Wars movie. It's insulting to it's audience disrespectful to the series lore and it's characters and it simply doesn't add up as a story. Big shame., 0.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977175053/, March 20 2018, N/A
 This movie is utter crap. It has some great sets and visuals but everything else that makes a good movie is not just lacking its disastrous. The plot has more holes in it then a swiss cheese the charachters have 0 development and aren't consistent with themselves. The established universe isn't consistent with itself and the main character is a typical Mary Sue highly unlikable character. This would be a bad pew pew laser movie if it wasn't star wars. But sadly being a part of this great series just makes it even worse. The prequels are great in comparison., 1.5,  Neven P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977175034/, March 20 2018, N/A

 After dragging myself to the end of episode III I promised myself never to watch another star wars movie. Twelve years later I thought screw it lets see what this one is made of.

 I'm just a long term fan and this is my first review here but I felt I needed to add my voice here. I was 10 when StarWars came out in 1977. I even enjoyed episodes 123. I saw LastJedi and came out thinking hmm that was kind of fun but also felt something was wrong and then it hit me. This was not Star Wars. The fan movies on youtube were better than this thing. But in the end I really disliked what they did to the old heroes. This seemed like a case of "we need to make the old characters look bad to make our new look good". There are so many good stories they could have told after ReturnOfTheJedi but their best idea is "Han and Leia are bad parents raise a kid who turns to the dark side gives up and divorce Luke gives up and goes away to hide on an island and politics are boring so even though the entire franchise makes a big deal about philosophy/force/political forces lets just make a simple action story. Why couldn't they leave the old characters alone let them die heroes before these movies start and just start up a new story 100 years after ReturnOfTheJedi. Maybe the younger generations likes this maybe they are totally loving these characters maybe they like the no-story but lots of action plot maybe I'm not the demographic anymore. Well if that's the case... you succeeded. This is not StarWars for me and I have no interest in seeing anymore from the WaltStarDisneyWars universe. Disney you should have stuck to Tron and made that into a franchise series., 2.0,  Jessica S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/802530041/, March 20 2018, N/A

 I cannot believe that anyone would say that this movie honors anything about the other films' legacy it doesn't even honor its predecessor "The Force Awakens". This is a husk of a film devoid of soul and character...and plot. It's perfect for those who mistake the vanity of special effects combined with completely cliche stupor-inducing 4th wall-breaking humor and dialogue for something useful or meaningful. It feels mopey and sad yet unimportant. The entire conflict of the film seems laughably small in scale as a seemingly few dozen ships and people at odds speak in terms of galactic importance. The feeling of desperation and a true conflict is lost here. <br><br>People will meander about and then occasionally give empowering speeches and talk about resistance and love and how important what they're doing is. You will actually root for the antagonists and hope their opposites are killed off just to spare you their stupidity and the one dimension they exist in. (The First Order are basically a bunch of bumbling police officers with billy clubs in a 1900's silent comedy film chasing a perp though so good luck with that!)<br><br>References to the original trilogy in this movie feel so mismatched that it genuinely feels like a parody when you do hear a familiar score or see a familiar sight. You'll hear plenty of recycled dialogue though (to much lesser impact of course). Old characters are butchered and inconsistent as they pull 180's from who they actually are to make this story happen. Men of great wisdom will revert to sulking childlike states and tell you to leave them alone as they storm off to their room while really wanting you to follow them and ask what's wrong. This is a film for the masses that has conformed to appeal to the lowest common denominator. Please steer clear. You could hand me a rock and call it Star Wars and I'd probably be happy and yet this film still manages to disappoint me., 1.0,  matthew r, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977171498/, March 18 2018, N/A

 Since critics failed at their job with this movie. I need to contribute something to expose this atrocious film. People who like this film should try looking at this film from "fake drama" perspective if they are willing to learn why there are people that hate it.<br><br>The whole running from first order sequence makes no sense. First a convenient hyperspace tracker is convenient. Second even with tracker the best course of action for resistance fleet is still spreading out and going into hyperspace. First order forces would either be split up for pursuit or focusing on bigger targets like Raddus. The point is here that you don't need special tactics even with an Ex Machina as big as hyperspace tracker.<br>Split into groups jump to populated planets dump the ship and blend in with the crowd. Standard guerilla tactics which Resistance should be very familiar with by now and it is way better than staying together as sitting ducks until fuels run out. For this chasing to happen somehow they have to stay together fuels have to be introduced first order ships need to be slower than resistance ships  and tie fighters cannot be scrambled. The problem with using extra plot devices is that it made things complicated and is prone to producing plot holes like you can maintain momentum in space without using fuel. <br><br>This is a major plot of the film and yet it feels unnecessary and contrived just like the bomber introduced -- slow easy target sitting duck when dropping bombs which makes no sense because no gravity and there is already B-wing that can do the job better.<br><br>This is just an example of how poor the writing is. Scenes that would otherwise have no reason to be there are there by plot contrivance. This is a pattern throughout the movie. Rian Johnson wants the tension but he doesn't want to pay for it by writing a coherent plot without absurd plot devices so nothing felt like earned. <br><br>As another example look how Rian Johnson did with Luke. First he needed the tension and what is the most lazy way to do it? Make him do something he would never do. It creates huge tension alright because audience would go like "why? what happened!?".<br>But this tension comes with the risk of character assassination if not handled properly. <br>What are Rian Johnson's efforts in building up this? Scenes of Luke attempting to murder his nephew for lamest reason possible which as usual introduces more questions than it answers such as why Luke having thought of killing his nephew leads to that Jedi needs to end. It's not like Jedi orders Luke to kill his nephew. Also Luke IS Jedi order at this point he could make whatever rules as he sees fit. But no Rian Johnson told you that because of that mistake he decided to let the Snoke rule supreme let Kylo murder innocent as he goes and let his sister die. No this won't happen. Not in movie not in real life Luke Skywalker or anyone else. This is NOT what you would expect for human behavior. As mentioned Rian Johnson wants the scene and tension yet he did not want to pay the price for further explaining the motivation and consequences  or even why he came to Jedi island to die instead of everywhere else. A more blatant example of his lazy writing is when Luke came to burn the Jedi text which he did not destroy for all the years he was on the island Yoda popped up and gave him a lesson which he could've given at any given time for all these years he was on the island. Then SUDDENLY Luke wanted to protect those texts even just seconds ago he war carrying a torch to burn it! Again he wants the tension with little regard to continuity or if the plot makes sense.<br><br>If director does not want to pay for it WHY SHOULD WE?<br><br>Not to mention all the serious moments are undermined by his jokes. TONE Rian Johnson what is your TONE of the movie? Failure is the best teacher and Rian Johnson should learn from this dumpster fire of a movie.<br><br>Another major plot is where Rey conveniently found out there's good in Kylo Ren. Same thing happened here again as it happened throughout the movie. The setup is some force Skype call which only first appeared in this movie. OK. Even this were the case despite that we still don't know what's Kylo's reason of being bad Why is that ALL OF A SUDDEN Rey has to go to turn Kylo at this moment? She hated him just hours ago in movie time and now she wants to turn him to the good side? Fine. Then why now?<br>When you are next to Luke who you came here for help in the first place even though he is reluctant to help. It is at this moment that Rey thought "OK this seems a good time to turn Kylo Ren it's not like I have more important things to do and it's not like he or Snoke would hurt me and it's not like I have any leverage I can use". Did Rey read the script!?<br>She didn't even bother appealing to Kylo's good side like "let go of your hate". Not to mention this is a huge rip-off of ROTJ. Nowadays critics don't call this stealing they call this subversive. That is on top of the fact that Supermecy the flag ship of first order is like a kitchen is this movie where everybody comes and go as they please.<br><br>These are just some examples I'm not even getting started. But this should give you some perspective on why this movie makes no sense and people who like it may have viewed it differently once they stop assuming haters don't get the in-your-face message like "capitalism is bad" or "Luke came back from failure and saved the republic". <br>Take whatever bullshit backstory Rian Johnson feed you with a grain of salt just like I did above you may start to see that it breaks apart. <br><br>Oh for those "This is the best Luke I've ever seen". I recommend you watch Transformers episode 3 4 5.

 The movie itself was visually appealing and I would rate it high but then you factor in the completely useless Canto the unrealistic Leia Poppins when she and everyone else would have went through massive decompression *almost instant death seriously* and the way Luke was treated and not redeem himself in front of Rey's eyes the image of Luke and not his lightsaber not queuing Kylo into the truth the way the movie did not advance the story and instead killed off several plottable hooks (rey's parents Snoke dead no master of Kylo so no redemption arc the knights of ren cannot possibly have the power to command that entire empire and destroyed iconic lightsaber). Essentially Rian did all this and then drops the mic and says "Ha!" Try to do something with this now J.J Abrams.<br><br>It felt disrespectful to the franchise and to the next director.

 All I could say after watching the movie was shock and disgust. I could not believe what I just witnessed. They created an SJW movie that happened to have Star Wars as the background. This was worse than Phantom Menace!!!! The main point of a trilogy is to establish a cohesive story arc where you can see the hero's jounrey as they suffer hardships and success. You need to develop the character back stories in a way that we the audience can relate to and develop an emotional connections with so we actually care what happens to them in the story. None of this happened in this movie. I still don't know who these characters are and I don't care whether if they live or die. They managed to almost kill off every character in this movie. Who is left to fight in episode 9? I have no problems in seeing strong female characters but this is not the way to do it. If Disney needs hints at how this is done all Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy need s to do is watch Game of Thrones.

 I am happy I didn't see this movie in theatres but still disappointed in shelling out 20 dollars to stream it on PSN network. There is little else to say than this is a very bad movie. I loved (past tense) Star Wars. This has finally made me reconsider the legacy of the franchise. As other have so correctly pointed out... the plot to the movie is like an episode of family guy. There is little connection or depth to anything the characters have to say or any reverence at all to Jedi lore. Hell the word Jedi is in the title yet there is no information given about any of its core characters and their connection to the force. The script is utter nonsense with convoluted conversations about space gas and light speed all the while not explaining anything about who or where or why I should care about any of the characters. The writers were more interested in writing humor that made me wanna barf. It was hard to finish the movie. I'm sorry but Star Wars is dead. I'm sorry Luke but they butchered you too.

 By far the worst Star Wars movie. The attempt at comedic relief was unwarranted and did not make the plot any easier to swallow. It actually made me irritated when watching and started looking around the theater in disbelief. I felt like it was getting overly political undertones that seemed to actually detracted from what little good there was. Basically just threw away everything SW worked so hard to build simply for what appears to be a money grab by Disney and the expanding SW universe... which now I think will no longer be as interesting. Hoping JJ can save face on IX... but the damage that was done here on TLJ is just disappointing. Sobering.

 Absolutely worst thing to come out of Lucas Films ever.<br><br>Man I had such high hopes for this movie which turned a promising trilogy into complete and udder trash. I had such hope for Rey who turned out to be a Mary Sue character (not the only one) Snokes story turns out to be just a red haring. I don't know how anyone is saying it's original with it borrowing so heavily from Episodes V &amp VI while doing a piss poor job of it. There is a complete 30 minutes of the movie that serves no purpose other than delivery a political social justice message that slows down the movie even more. Which would have been fine had it actually added something to the movie character development instead of being preached at.<br><br>In the end I would gladly accept my money back and a apology from Lucas Films and Disney. Not for letting me down but for what is such a obvious fan exploitation money grab and thumbing of their nose to anyone who says it. You say you don't need the fan base to like the movie (catering to the fans) let's see how wallets and purses vote for you.

 Whereas the Prequel Trilogy could have best been described as a good story poorly executed The Last Jedi is best described as a poor story beautifully executed. Johnson has created a very visually stunning yet ultimately unsatisfying film that fails nay actively rejects to take advantage of anything that was set up before it. The central message (What came before doesn't matter throw it away) seems to be more of a commentary on the director's view of the series itself rather than reflecting on anything that actually takes place within the story itself. The abject dismissal of any of the set ups from the previous film feels almost like an attempt at a retcon of The Force Awakens. Which could be forgiven if he replaced those plot hooks and story elements with anything of substance Johnson however offers nothing new to add to the story instead replacing potential backstory with a nihilistic "doesn't matter anyway". Even the plot itself is muddied with the same nihilism the casino planet trip ends with them finding out that their efforts would have no effect not because they failed but in fact in either event and mostly seemed to be there to allow for some mild virtue signaling about cruelty to animals (and let's not even get started on the fact that they freed the animals but left the child slaves to their fate).

 I'm not going to tell you The Last Jedi is a bad movie it simply isn't true but it's also no the greatest and I'll explain why. For the most part I think this has to do with the change of directors half way through the new saga Rian Johnson does something wonderful for this film with it's fun tone but I don't think it fit so much with the first movie to no fault of his own that is. This movie seemed like it would have possibly been much more well received by fans if it were just a star wars story and not a continuation of a saga since it seems like in this film the old characters are disregarded and their arcs are altered beyond belief. For example with Luke and without spoiling it (because that's despicable) he acts very out of character in this film something that is not fleshed out very well and rushed through due to the amount of material that had to be put on screen it seemed like they didn't have time for Luke in this film he's in it very minimally. While I agree the new films are about the new characters (and they're done well) the old ones seemed to be ignored and pushed to the side lines in service of others that paid no resonance to the story. For example a new character Admiral Holdo is introduced but seemed unneeded as a rebellion general due to the existence of a fan favorite Admiral Ackbar. Captain Phasma from the first movie serves as a cookie cutter villain again this time around and does not have any emotional weight or impact on the story when she encounters Finn. Rey has her character developed very well as does Kylo but it is at the expense of the rest of the story with extended scenes with new character Rose and Finn on a side plot that doesn't seem to matter in the grand scheme of things and just as easily could have been cut out with no impact on the film. Many set ups from the first movie are never answered in this movie the light saber is thrown away by Luke and while this serves as a funny joke it takes away the emotions built up by the last movies ending and shows the clashing ideas of both directors play out. It just feels out of the tone that was built up this and many other questions are either left without a resolution or are teased and then revealed to be inconsequential. This is not to say this movie does not have great moments the fight scenes are beautifully shot and make other fight scenes from the previous movies look rookie. Some moments with old characters are done very well and isolated are amazing on their own. Daisy Ridley does Rey almost better than the first film and Oscaar Isaac as Poe steals the show again as the new Han Solo type. Mark Hamill does a great job returning as Luke and sells some of the character changes better than they would have read on paper. John Boyega makes Finn's character seem different from the first in a good way but he is also still portrayed as a coward only to prove himself later to not be which seems like the same beats hit in the first movie and already established. Which was an unfortunate backtrack nonetheless he was still a great part of the movie in his parts but the parts with Kelly Marie Tran seemed unnecessary while she executed the character very well it seemed she was underused as Rose. I thought the character was very interesting and not really someone you would see in the foreground in a star wars movie but I would have likes to see more of the character if she had a notable effect on the plot. Overall this is a good movie and well worth the watch just for Adam Driver's Kylo Ren it's very different from the first while keeping all of the good aspects of the character and he is by far one of the most tortured and intriguing characters of the film. A note on the porgs also which I hear as a complaint is not really we had Ewoks after all. Anyways I do recommend this movie even with critique. It is a good movie and don't let people tell you otherwise every movie has it's flaws but that doesn't mean this one is without it's gems and gem foxes., 3.0,  Josh K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/931853787/, March 16 2018, N/A

 This movie's similar to The Empire Strikes Back in the sense that it goes in directions you don't expect and keeps you on razor's edge the entire time.

 The Last Jedi was 2 1/2 hours of missed opportunities. Rian Johnson has effectively ruined the Skywalker legacy and crippled the Sequel Trilogy due to his 'bold' and 'unexpected' choices for Episode VIII...to the point I doubt JJ can save it with IX. Sadly I refuse to watch any film in Johnson's new trilogy because of how offensive this movie is. For all of it's faults and criticisms of being derivative The Force Awakens was exciting fun and introduced enough new elements that set up the Sequel Trilogy brilliantly. All Johnson had to do was carry it through to a satisfying middle act. Yet he throws it all (and I mean ALL) away and what he delivers is a terribly disjointed mess that dishonors just about every major character the 7 films which preceded it and the mythology of the Force itself. This middle chapter feels like the middle finger. When the star of your film says "'I pretty much fundamentally disagree with every choice you've made for this character"...maybe you should have listened and listened closely Johnson. When The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones have higher audience scores than your film (no matter how Disney and the press wish to spin it) you've made a major misstep. I don't hate the prequels nor do I demonize George Lucas. The Prequel Trilogy is far from perfect but it is imaginative and fun and tells the backstory George had envisioned since the '70s. Each episode builds on the previous one (as it should). As I watched The Last Jedi I kept wondering if Johnson had actually seen The Force Awakens. And the character assassination of Luke Skywalker is simply unforgivable. History will not be kind to this film and many die-hard fans will rue the day Disney threw out Lucas' original treatments (if they don't already). I miss you George I really do. Help us JJ you are our only hope. <br><br>(And no Disney I'm not a bot a troll a Russian a hack a Hobbit a Muppet or anything else your marketing campaign has to say about fans who didn't like this film)., 0.5,  Jeff R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/920026470/, March 16 2018, N/A
 I absolutely loved The Last Jedi. I've been a fan of the saga for nearly 40 years and this is really one of the best in the franchise. Lucasfilm is knocking it out of the park with the sequel films. This film is rich in emotion story stunning visuals and excellent acting. The hero's and heroine's journeys are playing out beautifully here. I can't wait to see how it concludes! My only complaints are kid actors who can't act and Finn's story being reduced to a space horse race. Rose is a decent character. I hope the two of them get a more pivotal and entertaining part in the story for 9. I won't address the haters the hater bots or the fanboy whiners directly. I will simply say if you like this movie don't let the hate deter you. And if you are rooting for redemption don't let people gaslight you. The Skywalker Saga isn't likely to end in tragedy. mtfbwy, 5.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977168227/, March 16 2018, N/A
 Not interested. I did not watch the ep. 7 New Hope re-imagining.

What surprises me is Disney's willingness to pump $200 million into an endeavor that alienated so many dedicated fans.

This was so deliberate that I'm forced to assume it was the latter.<br><br>If you wanted to make money by pulling fans into the theaters in droves this sure was a strange way to go about it.

 Yikes this film is so controversial with fans. Either this is a masterpiece or a heap of garbage. It sure isn't either of those. It is quite flawed but has no ridiculously offensive changes from the previous entries. Rey Phasma Kylo Ren Finn and Poe Dameron return after a rather enjoyable previous film. Despite a jarring but exciting cameo Mark Hamill returns as the iconic hero Luke Skywalker and so does the sadly deceased Carrie Fisher as Leia. The action is quite impressive at most parts especially the duel between Kylo and Rey versus the Praetorian guards. This film goes in so many crazy places that I'm surprised this wasn't cut to shreds like say Justice League. The sudden caring side of Kylo honestly took my surprise but to be totally honest why?? He was so close to returning to the light side and just went to back to evil warlord again. Also Rose and Holdo were totally unneeded additions. I know diversity is important but their performances were pretty boring. Phasma had a little more screen time than in TFA but went out almost as lamely as Boba Fett. Rey gave a decent performance but wasn't as exciting as before. Finn's dynamic with his peers is just as present and is far more heroic. Poe is more of an idiot and was written poorly. Luke was amazing. He embodied what it meant to be a Jedi knight. Dare I say he was a better mentor than Alec Guinness's "Ben" Kenobi. Kylo Ren was great as well. He was amazingly villainous and was truly intimidating and powerful. He wasn't as edgy and defiant as he was in TFA fortunately. Serkis was a fine Snoke for his limited screen time but he deserved more background maybe lots of background would have helped. Sadly the Rey parent reveal was disappointing. She couldn't be a nobody. She is a great warrior. How could she just be the offspring of some wasted alcoholics? All weaknesses aside it is a good Star Wars movie but not on the same level as say Sith or Empire. 7/10, 3.5,  A.J. L, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977165061/, March 16 2018, N/A

 While stepping all over the lore/characters that made the franchise what It is a sloppily penned path is chosen In the Last Jedi. One where the age old saying 'you can be anything you want when you grow up kid" is echoed throughout each silly over the top scene. The Cinematography and action sequences are great but the writing is poorly thought out that which makes for a great story. Instead of stomping out the old story line ungracefully a well written one where both the old saga/characters and new ones both receieve the respect they deserve could have been chose. Would'a should'a could'a though young padiwans of modern mtv soap opera cinema., 2.5,  Alexander%20 N, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977166918/, March 15 2018, N/A

 I am a devoted star wars fanatic and have been since watching A New Hope for the first time as a child. Watching The Last Jedi was the most excitement I have had while watching a star wars film outside of the original trilogy. The story presented in this film is a unique addition to the star wars story and in every way defied and literally slashed through the unoriginal storyline and events deemed important by Episode VII. The Last Jedi has me excited about episode IX which did not occur at the mediocre conclusion of episode VII. Star Wars is back and The Last Jedi is a welcome addition that finally took some risks instead of trying to please the crowd with the same old thing over and over again while holding true to the customs of the Jedi Order. The Last Jedi explores the Jedi on a deeper note touching upon faults of the Jedi their teachings and it amplifies Yoda's choice to go into exile in episode III due to failure focuses on this Jedi mentality while providing opportunity for redemption. The Last Jedi finally paves a new path for an improvement on the Jedi teachings with the potential of a future order or maybe even something better., 4.5,  Matt P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977166668/, March 15 2018, N/A

 The only redeemable feature of this garbage movie is its pretty visuals. I went into the movie with an olive branch to the trilogy with a condition. I wanted an original plot I didn't get one. It's the same movie That Empire Strikes back was with the battle of Hoth moved into the end of the movie and the show off between the bad guys was ripped from The Return Of The Jedi. Even the confrontation with the bad guys was same with The Villain turning on The Evil Dark Lord Wizard. The plot structure is the same. The Good Guys separate with the Main Protagonist going to training while his/her Friends fight The Empire. Oh I'm sorry. I meant The First Order. When The Friends are in trouble The Hero comes to save them. The movie plays out a little differently BUT The Plot Structure stays the same! <br><br>The entirety of the movie centered around the plot of a boring and dragged out naval combat in space. The enemies were portrayed as incompetent idiots and thus unintimidating. The Main Character is an aimless Mary Sue that just wins at everything because she grew up as a stick wielding scrap collector on some isolated Tatooine rip-off? Really? She never got trained and Yoda says she already knows everything? What the hell is she? Did she just absorb the knowledge like some omniscient hive-mind? That pissed me off. Rey gets a crash course on the philosophy of the force and just gets it and goes back to kicking bad guys? The whole movie is filed with SJW garbage and themes about evil rich guys and animal rights. The ending with the little kids using the force just screams about themes of equality. It's all just a huge load of nonsense. Make no mistake the newest Star Wars trilogy is just a defacto reboot trilogy with SJW crap all over it. Don't support Disney Star Wars with your money and just pirate it if you have to see it.

 No character development. Snoke was cast away after being portrayed as the new biggest baddie in the galaxy. Phasma was beat in a fight by the AWOL janitor. Took time to save the animals even though your friends could die any second (not that I'm against saving animals but the timing was bad). Luke's death was somewhat understandable but badly timed. Afterwards bad ratings were blamed on bots when the movie clearly displeased long-time fans of the Star Wars Universe., 1.0,  Zane T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977077138/, March 15 2018, N/A

Snoke and Phasma were wasted amd the Skywalkers were wiped out...surprising since Kathleen Kennedy said the Episodes would deal with the Skywalker family and then she essentially wipes them out. <br><br>Anything special the original trilogy achieved got thrown away in Episodes VII &amp VIII...really wish George Lucas would come back., 0.5,  Patrick W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976938860/, March 15 2018, N/A
 Terrible Star Wars movie. Full of sloppy writing and massive Canon loop holes. <br><br>A cinematically pretty movie it becomes evident very quickly that the directors put zero thought into this films relationship to the other Star Wars movies. Instead of focusing on critical character development the movie went for cheap yuks and thrills in the form of bad jokes a batch of useless characters and exhausting/unnecessary chase scenes. Throughout the movie I found myself asking okay so when do we get to the important parts? In fact the movie brought nothing to the table in terms of storyline and honestly it feels like despite having a second movie we are exactly where we were after ep 7. <br><br>Who was Supreme commander Snoke? Doesn't matter. <br>The knights of Ren? Who cares. What's the deal with Phasma? Doesn't matter. Rey's Parents? An afterthought. Since when can Jedi's use their powers to breath in space? At what point did "gods speed" replace "may the force be with you?" Why was Luke as deeply Jaded as he was? Why does a trillion dollar space ship not have autopilot? The list just goes on and on.<br><br>This movie had some nice moments (Rey and Kyle fighting together) but overall was just really a horrendously poor excuse for an installment of a Star Wars movie.<br><br>Not sure who paid RT to post a 90% score but this movie should be removed from the Canon because its total garbage., 1.0,  Alex R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/789915796/, March 15 2018, N/A
 All style with no substance. A visually beautiful movie that lacks story and any continuity with the Star Wars Universe. I walked out of the theatre not overly happy but not overly upset either just "meh". Upon reflection though this movie will make any fan (not Fanboy) of Star Wars furious.

 1 star for very pretty visuals and sound and overall stellar production quality. The story was quite bad and the more I think about it the worse it gets. As so many others have noted Luke's character was fundamentally changed. While that doesn't bother me in and of itself the fact that there was no explanation as to how he ended up with such a changed character is bad writing to me. I am now forced to create my own backstory to try and figure out how Luke changed from episode 6 to Episode 8 - which I cannot do because the change defies my imagination.<br><br>I also am forced to create my own backstory as to how Leia has such powerful force abilities. Maybe she trained with Luke maybe she trained with Ashoka or something maybe maybe maybe. The point is I should not have to create my own backstory to understand why things are happening in chapter 8 of a 9 chapter saga.<br><br>Besides that I simply didn't enjoy the story. How much time passed between 7 and 8? Why are the rebels under attack by the first order and why are they taken off guard such that they couldn't fuel their own fleet? Since when is fuel an issue in Star Wars? When did the first order take over the galaxy? Did the destruction of star killer base do nothing to damage them? Why after such a stellar victory are the rebels so weak and the first order so powerful?<br><br>Once we have all these issues the smaller "nit-picky" things come to light. Your Mama jokes are stupid why is Poe able to take out all the servo lasers on the dreadnaught with 1 x-wing? Why are there WWII era bombers in space? How does 1 damaged tie fighter destroy 3 bombers? Why aren't all the other star destroyers behind the dreadnaught doing nothing instead of attacking Leia's fleet? <br><br>The very slow chase sequence was stupid to me. There are dozens of star destroyers behind Snoke's flagship. Have a few of them jump to hyperspace in front of the rebels and cut them off then blow them up. If Finn and Rose can take a transport to go play craps why don't they just ferry people off the ship and escape in that manner?<br><br>There are so many more points and issues that I have with this movie but they have all been addressed by others in depth. <br><br>To end I simply have no desire to see episode 9 - not due to any boycotting issue but because I have no interest in seeing what happens. Rey has defeated Kylo twice in two movies she never struggles against him she never struggles with the dark side she overcomes all challenges with ease and apparently without any growth. Luke is dead Snoke is dead and Rey easily bests Kylo. So she will simply walk up to him and either redeem him or defeat him without any challenge or any growth - the end.<br><br>I am very curious to see how Solo and Episode 9 do in light of this movie. So many people are claiming that the people who like it are paid for by Disney and the people who didn't like it are a small vocal minority. I think the box office numbers for Solo and Episoda 9 will shed some light on those theories., 1.0,  Ken M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977166159/, March 15 2018, N/A

 As kilo ren says in this movie "let the past die kill it if you have to." To me and many people Rian Johnson has taken this quote to heart and has ruined the Star Wars universe with is feminist funded anti men film by not keeping to the lore of the universe and by creating so many plot holes that even spongebob has less holes in him than this movie. Despite what he has done to the lore the movie is kinda enjoyable (mindless joy) especially some of the fight scenes and looks spectacular at some points. However this does not excuse Rian Johnson one bit for not having his writers do at least one bit of research before writing this at best Star Wars fanfic. And Rian Johnson love for ww2 bombers ruins the established lore that y wing BOMBERS ARE BETTER AND FASTER THAN SOME SLOW TANKY SHIPS WHICH EXPLODE IN ONE HIT! If you are a true Star Wars fan who loves the lore and knows more about Star Wars than Rian Johnson and his feminist loving writers. Then you will hate this movie like I did., 0.5,  Matthew B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977166038/, March 15 2018, N/A

 NOTE: Apparently RottenTomatoes doesnt count 1/2 star or zero star ratings make sure you give this movie ONE STAR to be counted. There is something REALLY fishy going on with the reviews on this movie. Disney is DEFINITELY paying or influencing the reviews. MAKE YOUR VOICE COUNT AGAINST THIS TERRIBLE MOVIE.<br> <br>Review of Social Justice Wars : The Last Mary Sue &amp the Diversity Crew:<br><br>I remember watching The Phantom Menace as a 17 year old when it first came out and thinking "wow there is no way any future Star Wars movie could possibly be worse than this".<br><br>But the universe in all its infinite wisdom &amp patience just laughed and nearly 18 years later an took the older wearier and more tired version of me and subjected him to this abortion of a film.<br><br>Where to begin? let me try to go in order:<br><br>1) Opening space battle: despite losing the Death Stars to small fighters and having fought the Rebellion for 30+ years the First Orders commanders are utterly unprepared when a single fighter manages to sneak past their big canons and severly damage their biggest dreadnought. Snoke was apparently unaware his capital ship that he is on now has a device that can track the Rebel fleet through hyperspace. Apparently the Galaxy Far Far away does not bother with gravity and vacuum as the Rebel bombers literally "drop" bombs "down" in space. And the only way to release said bombs is with a remote control one that is easily dropped lost or fumbled. Poe made a prank call to open up the movie.... HILARIOUS right!??<br><br>2) Plot : what in the name of all that is holy was the point of that IDIOTIC Finn/Asian chick side quest? Not only did the out of place Casino planet fee straight out of a James Bond movie and UTTERLY took me out of the film (tuxedos dice popular Earth gambling games etc) the entire side quest was COMPLETELY POINTLESS and served no purpose other than to give the two minority characters something to do. And when the hell did Rose fall in love with Finn? In the in-universe few HOURS they were together? Also according to the #MeToo movement isnt Rose kissing Finn while he was almost passed out now considered "Sexual Assault"? Imagine if Finn did that to Rose? And if the whole quest was to get in contact with a super rare Code Breaker (too bad they don't have R2 D2) what are the chances they would just HAPPEN to be locked in with an equally competent code breaker just in time to escape together? <br><br>3) Excessive SJW/Feminist/Political correctness. If I walk into a room and theres me (middle eastern) an African American an Asian a Jew and a gay person (all mixed genders) great! No problem. Its when its artificially shoved down our throats and forced that it becomes an issue. Rose has no reason for existing other that to have an Asian character and fill in the diversity quota. She adds exactly zero to the plot and her removal would make no difference what so ever. Admiral Holdo is in the most ham fisted literal sense the purple haired physical manifestation of modern day toxic feminism. She literally has purple hair and her entire purpose to is put the "mansplaining" hot shot Poe in his place and to show that despite her being completely and utterly stupid and irrational by any standard she really isn't at all and that this proves that all women really are rational even when they are not. And its just men keeping them down! Speaking of which apparently all competent leaders in this new Star Wars are women and all the bumbling incompetent ones are white stuffy men.<br><br>4) The "hyperspace ram" scene. Oh my god this single scene just made the entire Star Wars saga completely and utterly irrelevant:<br><br>A New Hope: "Sir we just analyzed the Death Star plans and devised a risky assault plan....<br>"Just hyperspace ram it"<br>ESB: "Sir our troops are assembled and ready to commence the ground assault against the Rebel base...."<br>"Just hyperspace ram the Shield Generator then hyperspace ram the Rebel base"<br>Return of the Jedi : "Sir the Death Star is just ahead and we are preparing our fleet to...."<br>"Just hyperspace ram the Death Star"<br>"But sir its protected by an energy shield from the Forest Moon of Endor"<br>"Hyperspace Ram the Shield generator then hyperspace ram the Death Star"<br>Rogue One: "We have the Death Star plans but we need to deactivate the shield in order to be able to transmit it to the...."<br>"Just hyperspace ram the shields until they are.... actually we can just hyperspace ram the Death Star anyways. I guess we dont need those plans after all ok guys lets go home"<br><br>Besides directly making all of the above completely irrelevant what happens in this new Disney Star Wars universe if a pilot falls asleep on the wheel and accidentally hyperspace rams a planet? What if he was checking his Twitter while piloting? or a disgruntled former employee? A terrorist?<br><br>Speaking of the Death Stars too why build such an expensive space station when you can just strap on a hyperdrive to random asteroid and hyperspace it into a planet? Much more cost effective and same exact effect no?<br><br>Finally why did "Admiral" Holdo wait until the very LAST REBEL ship to hyperspace ram the Capital ship of the New Order? She sacrificed like what a dozen Rebel ships before she apparently came up with that brilliant idea? I'm guessing the purple hair dye seeped into her brain or maybe it was just the patriarchy holding her down. Who knows?<br><br>5) Luke Skywalker. Now here is a man who at the tender young age of his early 20s was plucked out of obscurity from a remote desert planet and despite everyone and their mothers telling him otherwise decides that Darth Vader the notorious mass murderer and the Emperor's right hand man had some good in him and he bravely went and confronted him not once but TWICE. Where is this hero? Apparently broken and defeated because a barrel chested angsty teenager got a little mad at him forcing him to abandon his friends family and all he has ever fought for and sulk like a coward milking some kind of space cows. Fruthermore whats the point of the ghost projection at the end if he was going to die anyways? Why not go there as a man worthy of the Luke Skywalker legend? I have no problem with characters changing thats fine. Its how the story teller TAKES that character there is what counts. To take someone like Luke and have him turn into a sulking coward you have to EARN the right to that to him by exceptional story telling. <br><br>6) Rey "Mary Sue". Please keep in mind that in the in-universe timeline Mary Sue was at best a week removed from her escape from Jakku. In that short amount of time somehow she manages to 1) defeat Luke skywalker in an impromptu melee 2) Defeat Snoke's Elite bodyguards in a grossly over matched setting 3) use the Force competently enough to defeat Kylo Ren who has presumably been training since childhood 4) and outfly trained TIE Fighter pilots among many other super human feats. 5) Know how to swim.... after living her entire life on a desert planet. Anakin Skywalker who was "too old" at 9 years old to even begin training must be jealous. Luke the son of the prodigal Anakin Skywalker had to struggle to even move a lightsaber and spent months on a swamp planet with a dyslexic talking frog just to learn the basics of the Force and got his hand chopped off for his efforts.<br><br>7) The entire plot revolves around the FO fleet slowwwwly crawl up to the escaping Resistance fleet. First of all why does light (laser beams) "lose power" over the distance of a few kilometers in vacuum? And since when do Star Wars ships "use fuel" when in the still canonical cross section books even the oldest Republic Era capital ships were powered by "massive fusion generators that generate more power than a star"? Just to serve a contrived and boring plot point and give a movie something to make it last 2 hours? Did the Death Star have to stop by a gigantic Chevron gas station in space on its way to blow up Alderaan? Hopefully Tarkin let the Stormtroopers use the bathrooms and grab some snacks real quick. Is Pablo Hidalgo still around to make sure consistency in the SW canon is maintained? Or is it now the "Kathleen Kennedy **** show"?<br><br>8) The entire Resistance is apparently comprised of a few hundred people. For an entire galaxy of quintillion beings. Apparently the Resistance capital ships have a population density less than that of your average crack house. Just how 12 is Rian Johnson exactly? And why is the only way to send a message to their allies on that old Rebel base? no one has an iphone? They managed to contact Maz just fine before.<br><br>8 ) Snoke.... why kill off the single most interesting new bad guy? Space Leia... why? The third leg on those Rebel speeds on the planet Crayt that create a very visually distinct red trail easily trackable by the enemy....why? The resistance keeping the base door open until the last second causing needless casualties....why? How did that Code breaker even know of the Rebel plans? Finn and Rose left before anyone even knew what the plans even were. Who told him? Who told Finn/ Rose? Speaking of the Dynamic Diversity Duo how did they manage to make it back to the Rebel base on Crayt so quickly without getting shot at by the AT-AT walkers once their speeders crashed? DOES THIS MOVIE EVEN STAY CONSISTENT TO ITS OWN SELF?<br><br>The entire existence of this movie which removed any and all interesting characters and mysteries (Snoke Reys parents Luke etc) introduced in Force Awakens. Why? What about the Knights of Ren CLEARLY shown in the Force Awakens as being part of the destruction of Lukes Jedi Academy? The level of carelessness in constructing a coherent consistent trilogy is astounding. I would not be surprised in the slightest if I found out Rian Johnson never even watched the Force Awakens or at best was given a rough outline of what happened in it.<br><br>In short.... congratulations Universe. You win again.<br><br>Not just the worst Star Wars movie ever but honestly just one of the worst movies in general.<br><br>Rian Johnson is just an edgy douche bag who clearly enjoys taking what he knows people like and expect and just going the complete opposite way just to be a contrarian jack ass If that's all Disney wanted they could have just made Luke Skywalker be the leader of a group of space faring Force using Unicorns who are the reincarnated Jedi masters of the past and shoot lasers out of their horns. Even less people would have expected that so it HAS to be good right?<br><br>Kathleen Kennedy is a well know hardcore feminist idiot. Now that old white dude Lucas is not the boss anymore Kathleen is having a field day shoving her toxic neo-feminist garbage down our throats.<br><br>Please don't support this film. Don't support Disney. They are the epitome of a soulless corporation that specializes in mass producing generic unimaginative digital content and overcrowded overpriced theme parts. They need to learn their lesson and not be the arrogant corporation they are and go back to their roots. RT is not calculating the REAL scores of this film correctly. Its audience approval is WAY less than 49% and the fake "five star" reviews are barely one or two sentences long. All the professional critics paid off or intimated by Disney are now exposed and will lose a TON of credibility in their future reviews.<br><br>This is just a MESS.

And she (it more appropriately) bites his hand and spits.<br>- A stormtrooper recognizes Finn and slaps his butt.<br>- Luke trolls MaRey teling her that some bad guys are coming to the island to rape the nuns and she runs to save them but discovers that they are nice guys who only want to dance with the ladies. <br>- Finn tells Phasma that she squealed like a whoop hog when she shut down Starkiller's shields. And Phasma kills all surrounding stormtroopers so that they don't tell anyone what they heard.<br><br>This movie is extremely bad but it could have been really really worse.<br><br>N.D.

 I am not sure how anyone who loved the original movies could like this movie.<br><br>I went into it knowing every plot detail (from reading hundreds of terrible reviews on the movie) so the only scene that I might have thought was done 'well' did not have the gotcha for me. The movie is trash. The only thing watching it accomplished was making me hate these people even more.<br><br>You can tell the people at the helm of it are SJW who hate the originals. The whole force is female bs was in full force (ha) in this installment. Apparently there are no more aliens in the galaxy just pointless female characters who nag the only people actually doing something proactive.<br><br>Even my hubby who went into it excited about another SW installment and with an open mind hated it. I cannot count how many times he looked at me and asked 'What the actually f**k?' It was that bad. I will try to keep spoilers to a minimum.<br><br>There is a whole side plot with Rose (the most annoying character since Jar Jar) and Finn that could have been completely left out of the movie and it would not have mattered to the plot one bit. It was forced contrived SJW bs. If you watch this movie and do not immediately want to punch Rose in the face I am not sure we can be friends.<br><br>I knew they had destroyed Luke's character going in but it was incredibly painful to watch. He milks alien sea cows bitches and throws tainties like an emo child rambles like a drunken lunatic most of the time and then fails to actually show up to save the day and his sister. This is not the Luke Skywalker we have come to love.<br><br>Kylo Ren should NEVER take off his shirt again. Seriously creepiest part of the whole movie. Do not even get me started on 'mind skyping' or how ridiculous every single thing on the island was. Everything except Yoda who apparently has spent the past few movies smoking astral grass was pretty much trash.<br><br>I didn't hate Rey in the Force Awakens until I went back and tried to watch it recently. Then I seriously hated everything about her. I think I was originally so excited to see another SW movie that I looked over her epic flaws. They just make her 100 times worse in this installment. I was begging for someone to kill her.<br><br>Oops spoiler. She doesn't die. She doesn't even really do anything in this movie that serves a point EXCEPT one scene where she faces Gollum and tries to turn Kylo back into Ben. I was actually rooting for her in that scene because I think Ben would be a much more interesting character than Kylo. They have to ruin that too.<br><br>That was only one of two scenes I thought were OK. The other scene is the 'face off' involving Luke but I knew the giant spoiler going in so it kind of ruined it for me and even if it did not it was a pussy move on Luke's part. I wasn't aware that the most powerful Jedi since Obi Wan had grown a vagina since Return of the Jedi.<br><br>I am just going to stop now because I can't even put into words what an epic piece of space trash this movie is. The people at the helm should be fired tarred and feathered and never be allowed near another movie as long as they live. If only! This is where cinema is headed. Forget the past kill it if you have to. Everyone is special therefore no one is. You too can be a Jedi with zero training if you have a va jay jay.

 I walked into the Cinema with my family feeling the childhood wonder that star wars evokes. For months I've been talking with fans theorizing about all the possible ways "The Last Jedi" could turn out. Unfortunately it turned out to be one of the greatest blunders I've seen in all my years of watching movies.<br>*spoilers*<br>"The Last Jedi" destroyed the star wars cannon. The story's plot had more holes than a net. The pacing was terrible most likely due to the length of the film. However these things don't come close to the horrible characters. <br><br>This film utterly destroyed Luke Skywalker character. Luke was all ways the hopeful one who could shine in the darkness. He followed the hero's journey been through the fire and came out strong and still hopeful. He was the perfect Jedi who was exposed to the temptations of the dark side yet resisted them! *SPOILER* For him to become a cynical hermit who just wants to be forgotten make 0 sense. Mark even is quoted at saying the he personally disagreed with every aspect of his character in this film. And I unfortunately agree. Luke Skywalker would never act like that!<br><br>Reys character was over powered and underdeveloped I would call her a Mary sue if I ever seen one. Fin gos through the same character arch as the last movie. Poes character arch is to learn to run away which can be ok if not for him making every right decision in the movie. Roses character is nothing but detrimental to the plot. And literally nothing happend to kylos character he didn't develop...<br><br>Mary poppins is in the movie.<br><br>All in all the movie seemed to just make it up as it went. There was no continuity from the last one. Leaders of both the rebellion and first order are incompetent. The casino sub plot did nothing to the plot but criticise capitalism.<br><br>If you love Luke Skywalker! DON'T WATCH!!!, 0.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977165029/, March 14 2018, N/A

 This film is a corporate exploitational cash-grab. Sure that's always been Star Wars's gimmick to some degre but this has the writing structure of a Disney Channel TV movie.

 They should have named it WWII WARS.<br><br>Rian Johnson instead of using his time for watching the previous Star Wars movies and trying to get a glimpse of its world's inner structure laws lore and characters passed hours or maybe days watching old WWII war documentaries. <br>In that movies he saw some incredibly eye-catching scenes and he thought he could transpose them into a Space Opera movie.<br><br>That is an extremely and embrarassingly bad idea.<br><br>1. Bombers are used to hit a ground target which by definition cannot move. On Earth you could try bombing a slowly moving ship like an aircraft carrier but your bombers should be really fast. YOU DON'T BOMB A SPACESHIP which at every moment could (and should unless its captain is a complete retard) jump into Hyperspace and evade your attack by simply moving away a few miles.<br>Why did Moden Canady captain of the Fulminatrix not move the dreadnaught the exact moment he saw the bombers approaching is beyond incompetence. Leia Organa's decision to use bombers to target a spaceship is beyond incompetence. This entire movie is beyond incompetence.<br><br>2. In WWII movies the aircrafts that are hit become engulfed in flames and swerve because: a) their engines stop working the speed decreases dramatically and aerodynamic lift ceases b) gravity attracts them to the ground. In space a spaceship does not stop moving when the engine stops thrusting it. It continues with the same speed along the trajectory it had before the engines were stopped. It does not swerve because THERE IS NO GRAVITY IN SPACE. You can say what you want about other moments in previous Star Wars where physics is a bit different than that of our galaxy but gravity in space NEVER HAPPENED in the previous 8 movies. If Rian Johnson simply took the time to watch them he would have known.<br><br>3. An officer of the Fulminatrix dreadnaught is seen using A PERISCOPE. I spotted it the third time I watched this abomination of a movie. A PERISCOPE!!! As said before Rian Johnson is in love with WWII imagery and he felt compelled to insert a PERISCOPE on a spaceship. Too bad the use of this kind of device is ridiculous on a spaceship which is by no means immersed in a liquid that hides it from observers floating on the surface of that liquid. Why use such a device? Because it was so visually cool in all those WWII war documentaries!!! OK. We got it Rian but here it is RIDICULOUS nonetheless. And demonstrates how stupid and arrogant you are.<br><br>4. The use of a ground cannon drawn on the surface of the Crate planet is ABSURDLY RIDICULOUS. The resistance base could (and should unless all commanders of the First Order are idiots and/or incompetents) be destroyed with a single shot from an orbiting spaceship. No need to give the enemy enough time to escape.<br><br>Rian Johnson is incompetent and arrogant.

 OK it doesn't have Jar Jar Binks so it isn't the worst movie of the franchise but it certainly is not one of the best. The dialogue is atrocious! It lacks any conversational element. The gambling scene and the actions subsequent are wholly unnecessary to the plot and should have been excluded from the film. The action flits back and forth between sub-plots and results in a very choppy movie. I enjoyed it in the theatre when I watched it the first time despite the problems.

 **Spoilers**<br>Far too many plot holes to be written off with the typical response of "get over it it is scifi" The slow speed intergalactic chase was absurd. Running unarmed mining speeders directly into a front of walkers for no reason made no sense. Rey being an instant Jedi was not in keeping with the previous story lines and the amount of training that all other Jedi receive before being even close to as powerful. The "girl power" vibe was far too obvious and stank of corporate Hollywood boardroom decisions to be more inclusive given the current environment (not trying to get all Fox News on it but it really took me out of the picture). Unlike other reviewers I didn't mind where they took Luke in this picture. In fact it really kind of fits him if you think about it.

 After a long wait what a disappointment this movie is. Story feels rushed with many plot-holes and continuity problems from TFA.<br>It looks and sounds like a Star wars movie with its cutting edge visuals amazing sound-fx and gorgeous music score by John Williams. But it feels empty with no character development it lacks any kind of emotional content. I couldn't care less about any of the new characters now which is a shame because they had so much potential after TFA.<br>I loved both TFA and Rogue-one but I just cannot accept TLJ. It feels like a cheap generic sci-fi movie in a flashy Star wars wrapper. <br><br>I sincerely hope the Star wars brand can recover but the last jedi was a big let down for me and left me very unhappy and disappointed. I really wanted to like this movie., 1.0,  Joe M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977023792/, March 14 2018, N/A

 Awful. Ruined star wars for me. Didn't stay true to who luke was. too many political/social justice statements particularly in that pointless casino side-quest. very little continuity to episode 7.

 This movie is genuinely bad. Not just the pointless storylines that have been seen before. Not just the over-the-top acting and writing. Not just the floating Leia. The movie isn't even bad because of the creative decisions Rian Johnson made with the Star Wars world. What makes this movies bad is the close up face shots the gross and pointless characters and the fact that Johnson seems to have never seen The Force Awakens. I think I would like this movie better if it were a stand-alone film outside of J. J. Abrams story but it would still be bad., 1.0,  Matt W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/792299764/, March 14 2018, N/A
 (Thank you to A.P. Mike S. and everyone else who understands why the original Star Wars trilogy is the greatest film franchise ever. Now time for some fun)<br>SPOILER ALERT!: The script for Star Wars Episode IX "The Jedi Strike Back" just leaked. It looks incredible! Here is a summary of the plot:<br>The opening scroll states that after the Resistance escaped the salt planet at the end of The Last Jedi Poe and Leia died after an unfortunate series of events where Poe hijacked an escape shuttle from the Millennium Falcon to go back and fight the First Order but on his way he became distracted by a "Hot Babes of the Empire" magazine that fell from his overhead console and he consequently crashed. Leia then used the force in an attempt to revive him and fly him back through the vacuum of space. Unfortunately she meditated too hard and disappeared before Poe made it back in. (Too bad we won't be able to see that because it would have been an amazing way to send off Carrie Fisher's beloved character.)<br>After the opening scroll the camera focuses on the Falcon which is flying through space and ultimately lands on a desert planet. Rey exits the ship and uses the force to kill Kylo Ren telepathically. She then immediately gets killed after being hit by falling debris from Poe's escape shuttle. (Whoa! It's surprising because the audience thinks that Kylo and Rey are important to the story but they actually aren't! What a twist!)<br>Next scene is on the island planet where Luke is resurrected by Yoda who never really died in Return of the Jedi he just pretended to be dead so Luke would stop bothering him and leave his hut. Yoda and Luke then go to a beach resort planet where they meet a black girl who tells them they need to save the whales. Yoda and Luke check into a hotel together so that they can discuss strategy for saving the whales. While checking in Luke becomes mortified because Yoda keeps saying things to give the impression to the hotel manager that they are gay such as "size matters not" and "only one bed will we need." Although Yoda says these things because he's low maintenance and likes to sleep on the floor Luke doesn't realize this and the hotel manager thinks it's because they are gay so Luke is embarrassed and it's really funny. (Hilarious!)<br>Meanwhile there's a new empire that came up led by an old white guy named Lord Harwar. Lord Harwar nukes 4 planets. (The explosions are awesome!) After Lord Harwar nukes 4 planets Finn who is with Rose on a second mission to the casino planet to get the real codebreaker shouts "we need to stop Lord Harwar!" but Rose doesn't agree and tells Finn that they need to continue on their mission so that they can save more space horses from the evil people on the casino planet. Finn obeys Rose. Next scene Lord Harwar dies of a heart attack so it turns out Rose was right. Thereafter Finn and Rose selflessly sacrifice themselves to save all the space horses. The young boy with Jedi powers from the end of The Last Jedi then gives the eulogy at Finn and Rose's funeral ceremony. (Having the young boy with Jedi powers from the end of The Last Jedi give the eulogy is awesome because it shows that the traditional requirement that you should have known the person during their lives in order to give a eulogy is just an outdated way of thinking. Thank you Star Wars for entering the 21st century!)<br>Then we go back to the beach resort planet and there's a huge "laser sword" battle between some brand new characters with no backstory that have force powers. Everyone flies up off the ground using the force and they flip and move around in zero gravity despite the beach resort planet having earth-like gravity so it's super awesome! Meanwhile Luke and Yoda forget to save the whales because Luke is yelling at Yoda for unwittingly giving the impression that they were gay and it becomes apparent that Luke is homophobic. Because the whales are starving and no one is helping them the whales use the force to ignite the planet core and the world explodes. (The explosion is awesome! Additionally it turns out to be a real deep part of the movie because it shows even untrained animals can use the force.)<br>Then aboard the Millennium Falcon piloted by BB8 and carrying Chewie R2D2 and C3PO our remaining heroes contact Maz Kanata for advice and she explains to them (while she's wearing a jet pack and participating in a blaster fight against the bartenders' union) that they need to go to a jungle planet to get a lost force gem because it has the power to give force abilities to regular people. Upon arriving they meet a group of thieves who help them retrieve the lost force gem. After they obtain the force gem the thieves reveal themselves as the Knights of Ren and try to take the gem but BB8 kills them with a laser sword. Then BB8 accompanied by his fellow heroes flies the Falcon from the jungle planet and there's a huge space fight with TIE fighters. The Falcon barely escapes into hyperspace. (Breathtaking special effects!)<br>Then the Falcon lands on Yavin 4 and BB8 uses the force gem in an attempt to restart the Rebellion. Unfortunately the force gem turns out to be a dud. However in a huge twist we learn that regular people don't need a force gem to use the force because everyone has the force in them already they just have to believe it hard. Although the quest for the force gem was useless BB8 is awarded a medal for its bravery. Chewie who is reminded by C3PO that Yavin 4 is where the Rebellion refused to give him a medal at the end of Episode 4 then destroys BB8 C3PO and R2D2 with his bare hands. Chewie is then arrested and taken into a courtroom where he successfully pleads temporary insanity after delivering a passionate speech to the tribunal in his native tongue about how the killings were justified because BB8 didn't let him pilot the Falcon and R2D2 and C3PO reminded him of Han so he just wanted to kill the past. Thereafter Chewie regrets his actions and commits suicide. Then we get a shot of people all over the galaxy cheering. The end.

 Successfully destroyed the original trilogy. Why would they do this? No one knows. Luke represented the ideals one should strive for to be good to do the right thing and self-sacrifice for others. These were great standards for kids to strive for. That is what made the original trilogy magical and so popular. <br>This new series is deliberately trying to destroy the characters of the original series. I see two major themes that dominated the original trilogy and gave them life. First and most important was the hero's journey with Luke. Yoda and Obi Wan's primary concern was would Luke be able to overcome his fears? Luke's answer "I'm not afraid". He was tempted by the most powerful Sith Lord in the galaxy and his own father to give into his hate and fear in order to join the dark side. After successfully overcoming the trial of trials we are now supposed to believe he is hiding on some island. He is now afraid lost his hope stopped using the force and thinks the Jedi order needs to end. This effectively makes one of the most powerful lines in Jedi trivial. "You failed your highness I'm a Jedi like my father before me I'll never turn to the dark side." Are you kidding me? Completely destroyed the character. This is not the Luke you are looking for. <br>Secondly the romance between Han and Leah was another primary theme that held the movies together. Han who was first a pirate in A New Hope learned that there are things more important than himself. He learned to care for others and to be a part of something greater than himself for the good of the many (the rebellion). His character grew and evolved. <br>Fast forward to The Force Awakens and we find Han regressed all the way back to a pirate and only caring about himself. "Screw the rebellion its all about me" I could see this Han saying. Really? And that great romance of the original trilogy? I can't wait to hear how that turned out. Oh Han and Leah are not together and can't live with each other. Priceless. What is the fruit of their once great romance? Murder. Han gets murdered by his own son. <br>The saddest thing for me is going to be watching the original trilogy with my son. He is 4 and I was looking forward to this. Now when I see Luke triumph over fear in Jedi the message will not be as strong when I have to tell my son Luke ultimately utterly fails. And when he watches Han and Leah's romance blossom I'll have to lean over and tell him "it doesn't really go that well for them." "It might have been better if they had never met." How sad. These new films to a large degree ruined the original trilogy. Well that is of course if we watch them. <br>I really could go on and on if I only had the time. It was full of plot holes bad character development and much more I could talk about. But what hurt the most was the abuse the original characters took. I just felt I had to write something. If you are a fan of the Original Trilogy sadly I recommend that you not watch these films. Pretend they don't exist. They destroyed the characters most of us love. Way to go Disney., 1.0,  Mel%20 L, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977167714/, March 16 2018, N/A
 this crap made even less sense than the last one and killed any character growth that was already established not to mention pointless scenes and characters compelling devoid of any reason to be except serving one purpose to explain some bs in the plot. Horrible fighting scenes even Phantom Menace managed to capture epic sabre battle this one was pure garbage and pointless. The space battles held almost no sense at all (why didn't they do the last manoeuvre straight away???) not to mention super hero taking on the entire fleet by himself awful presentation of last trilogy main character that had no sense whatsoever...

 Don't get me wrong this is a good movie but there are two scenes missing from the movie. I haven't seen the deleted scenes yet so they may be in there but these scenes are needed:<br><br>First I believe Kathleen Kennedy (who I love and think is doing a great job with the franchise) asked why isn't Leia using the Force. It's no surprise that she could use the Force because she seems to be Force sensitive. Because her use of the Force to save herself was so alarming (she goes from no Force use to what seems like Master Force use) there should have been a scene where Leia uses the Force before she was blasted into space. Perhaps a scene where she is floating an object in her hand (perhaps a pair of dice) while nobody is watching. Someone could walk up not notice what she is doing and she stops and we've established she can use the Force before being stunned that she can. <br><br>Second there should have been more scenes at the end of the movie showing that the purpose of Luke doing what he did was so he could provide Hope to the galaxy. Frankly I was confused here. I couldn't understand what the purpose of Luke's sacrifice was and as a director I think the last thing you want your audience to be is confused. So perhaps a quick montage of scenes across the galaxy where the story of Luke's sacrifice is being told instead of just the one with the kids. That way you can establish that Hope is spreading. I just didn't get that there was Hope from the one scene unless the slave kids are going to rise up themselves in the next movie and create a Rebellion. Any way I left confused as to why Luke did what he did. I understand he was trying to spread Hope but the mark was missed here. <br><br>Anyway good movie. Well done but the message trying to get across was missed in a couple of places., 3.5,  Johnf F, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977167280/, March 16 2018, N/A

 Absolutely Terrible. Yes it's that bad. I've seen every Star Wars movie since Empire Strikes Back in the theater and after seeing this on opening day I sat in my seat absolutely STUNNED. My wife asked me "what did you think"? I said "Star Wars is dead" "it's over". Aside from being a bad Star Wars movie it's a bad movie all around in the most general sense. The community who built this franchise up deserves much better than what we are getting.<br>Yes is looks good as the people behind the scenes who never get the glory did a great job with the effects but that can't and never has sustained bad writing and story. Disney is selling you a well wrapped stinking pile of *&amp%$! This movie was a Disney cash grab.<br>The writing and the overall planning in the direction of this new trilogy is nothing but pure incompetence and laziness. The plot holes are glaring and obvious to the point that they sink the entire movie and any hopes that you have for the next installment. <br>For example if Luke is hiding on this island waiting to die with all hope lost for the jedi wanting he burn the tree and jedi text etc.. than why is Luke in his Jedi robes when Rey shows up at the end of Force Awakens picking up where Last Jedi begins? It makes zero sense and it's absolutely stupid. Fine you want to take it in a different direction than DO IT INTELLIGENTLY. The reason for this is obvious that this is not what JJ Abrams had in mind. When Ruin Johnson took the reins he just sloppily forgets all established plot and incompetently does what he wants with his arrogance trying to prove how bold of a director he is and Lucasfilm allowed this.<br>There is no motivation or back story to this big bad leader Snoke. They just toss him in there with imagery reminiscent of the Emperor for you to just assume and put the pieces together based on the Emperor from the original trilogy. Absolutely LAZY and sloppy.<br>Lucasfilm needs new direction as Kathleen Kennedy's leadership isn't cutting it. There should be ONE writer writing and planning ALL three installments before any shooting starts on the first film. Lucasfilm should Not just be thinking only as far as 3 installments they should have a team deciding on an overall narrative as to where they want to take this and build trilogy installments off of that.<br>Yes Rey is a Mary Sue which is ashame because I like Daisy Ridley. She's well cast. I know the filmmakers are trying to silence those criticisms by calling the people who say this sexist but they know better. Trust me they know what a Mary Sue is just as there can also be Gary Sue's in story telling. Before you say this is sexist google what a Gary and a Mary Sue are. Mary &amp Gary Sue's are CASH GRABS because they are just lazily injected as undeserved heroes to lazily entertain you for 2 hours. The definition of a Mary Sue is an idealized and seemingly perfect fictional character. Often this character is recognized as an author insert or wish fulfillment. They can usually perform better at tasks than should be possible given the amount of training or experience.<br>Rey is not developed properly. They establish her as a homeless scavenger but yet can fly ships escape from Starkiller base defeat Kylo Ren with NO training power in the force to knock Luke a jedi master down on the island and etc...<br>Go back and watch the character development of Luke in the original trilogy and watch him grow by Return of the Jedi. Luke is not a Gary Sue.<br>When you are injecting Mary or Gary Sue's into your franchise it's over.

 This is only my opinion and it can not hurt you so if you don't like how I feel that's OK only I have to feel this way not you. The last Jedi was at face value beautiful. I was so excited about seeing the characters I had grown up with brought back to the big screen. I generally enjoyed the film and did not walk out thinking it sucked or anything like that I laughed when you laughed and cheered when you cheered. I FELT a bit ripped off with the way they treated my favorite character. I know there is a whole feminism debate or something like that going on but I don't see that point of view rather just a bunch of characters that are very forgettable being shoved in my face at the expense of the true heroes. This whole film gave me no reason to care for the characters which at times had me routing for the empire lol.

 This is miles better than TFA just setting JJ Abrams aside and keeping that monster from interfering has produced a decent movie. There are no major continuity issues or incoherent scenes so that's a great improvement over the mess of TFA. That said the script remains quite bad. They keep making a copy of the original storyline they spin it switch it repaint over it but it's a poor choice nonetheless. The jokes seem misplaced known characters seem out of character and the new characters are not given anything to work with.<br>Daisy Ridley is a treasure and again they misuse her wasting an incredible opportunity.<br>One thing they do right is female representation all movies of all genres should look like TLJ in that regard.<br>Bottom line it sucks., 2.0,  Pablo C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/971746297/, March 14 2018, N/A

 Why Star Wars: The Last Jedi Sucks. In outline form.<br><br>Biggest Thing: Rian Johnson is bad at improv. He does not say "yes let's" to those who went before him. JJ Abram's setups are rejected. Not only that but the entire original trilogy is thrown in the trash. I would not want to perform with Johnson if I was doing improv. <br><br>Structural Issues<br>- Pacing <br>- Two climaxes<br>- Runtime too long<br>- Pointless subplots with no payoff<br>- Feels like 2.5 in the trilogy. Dips into what should be a third movie. (It even incorporates Return of the Jedi motifs) <br><br>Comedy and Tone<br>- Totally out of synch. Too comedic too often. <br>- Lack of weight. Rebels are being OBLITERATED and the tone is light.<br>- The first order are comedic. They should be menacing. <br><br>Awful Writing<br>- Much too focused on "gotcha" moments and screwing with expectations. Feels trolly. <br>- Truly awful moments. (SuperLeia and the airlock Rose saving Finn. Saving the animals. Etc.)<br>- Character inconsistencies. Luke. Kylo. Yoda has dementia. <br>- Rey is still a Mary Sue. The whole story so far takes place in about a week and she's already beating down Luke. <br>- Admiral Gender Studies shouldn't exist. Akbar or Leia should have done the kamikaze attack.<br>- Did Poe need such a belittling subplot? Poe deserved better.<br>- Why didn't Gender Studies just tell Poe the plan?<br>- Continuity errors. <br><br>Loose Ends Rejected<br>- Rey's parents? Drunks. <br>- Snoke? Some guy. He dead now.<br>- Luke's mission? Nothing.<br>- Knights of Ren? Gone. <br>- Finn's injuries? What injuries?<br>- Maz has lightsaber? No answer. <br>- Finn+Rose now. Because Rey+Kylo. <br>- The twist is that there is no twist. <br>- Where do we go from here? There's no more mystery. I don't care about episode 9 anymore. <br><br>Injection of Politics<br>- Feminism and awful female characters. They never earn anything.<br>- Animal rights!<br>- Think of the orphans!<br>- Rich people are evil.<br>- The military industrial complex?? (Space nazis aren't the only bad guys. So deep.) <br>- Make love not war... in star WARS<br><br>Deeper Meaning<br>- Star Wars used to be about the hero's journey in space. High fantasy wish fulfillment. Good versus evil.

 Everything in this movie makes little to no sense I'm not going to spoil it but be warned if you want to see good sci-fi this is not it. Every moment feels like "because a wizard did it!" Or "Because I a gal I'm right" it's getting old and we really need to stop this kind of story telling. A magic system needs to be well thought out and have clear boundaries otherwise that makes a story less compelling. This whole movie says flip good writing and I am sad to see Star Wars go even further down this path., 1.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977163877/, March 14 2018, N/A

 Complete and utter trash. Entire movie was built around political agenda. To each their own as far as beliefs but do not try to make a story fit into a political agenda. Pointless plot lines poor character development not staying true to old characters. Luke who refused to kill the baddest dude in the galaxy was going to kill his padawan. Come on son. All the build up in episode 7 led to nothing. It was almost one big fu to JJ. The Rey parents thing "we didn't want you to have to be a part of a certain family to be a Jedi".... did no one pay attention to the prequel? Anikan married in secret because they were not allowed to have families. So every other Jedi aside from the Skywalker was not a part of a certain lineage. What a load of an excuse. I liked Rey in the first one but every Jedi needs training. Where is hers? I don't mind she is a woman like Disney is trying to portray. Like I said I liked her I n force awakens. And Luke's character was destroyed. That isn't like. He would have left his sister to die, 0.5,  Christopher W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/908509893/, March 13 2018, N/A

 To quote YouTube's Mauler "WTF?"<br>I'm only a casual Star Wars fan but even I'm aware that there is no coming back from this one.

 Let me start out by saying I love starwars. I love starwars so much in fact that I will forgive much more in comparison to what I would forgive in other franchises for. Unfortunately this movie was bit of a mess. The plot was incoherent at points and the movie seemed to be proping itself up on nostalgia and not proping itself up on plot you cared about whatsoever. The characters are shallow and weak (aside from Kylo Ren who's character seems to have the only coherent progression and aim) and the most interesting characters are those from the original trilogy. I hate to say this but the majority of the movie was just bad. No other way to put it. I almost walked out (OF A STAR WARS FILM) when Princess Leia floated like a space witch back to a ship moments after her entire cabin got blown up and then I only stayed because it is star wars. Now all this being said I was impressed by a few scenes and that's why i would give this movie the descriptor of messy. It had all the potential but instead of hitting a ball and getting in base it kept hitting foul balls but still decided to run to first even though it wasn't really allowed to., 0.5,  Connor P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/799139495/, March 11 2018, N/A

 Star Wars: The Last Jedi had exciting action sequences and a few surprisingly emotional moments but with the lackluster storyline of Finn and Rose and cliche backstory to Kylo Ren this film did not feel nearly as good as The Force Awakens. All of the performances are somewhat engaging and the action scenes are also beautifully done but the plot felt largely lazy and much of the movie spent time on an absolutely boring storyline that although contributed to the movie in the end could've been executed far better. There was also odd character development in this chapter with traitors and evil characters who switched for no apparent reason -- everything felt very messy. Overall The Last Jedi was a visual treat with several emotional moments but it was not nearly as good as TFA. - 74%, 3.0,  Movie F, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976844425/, March 11 2018, N/A

 The Last Jedi was terrible. Not just because it was a bad "Star Wars" movie. It was just a bad movie period. I will not pay to see another Star Wars movie after this.<br><br>Spoilers. Ranked 8 of 9 Star Wars movies in my rankings. Hell people on Rotten Tomatoes gave Justice League a higher rating.<br><br>It wasn't just bad it was stupid . Here are a lot of the problems (Many borrowed from Ben Shapiro)<br><br>1. The Force Awakens Apparently Never Happened. At the end of the last movie you'll recall the Rebel Alliance blew up the Starkiller Base<br>devastating the First Order's capacity to make war. Or not.<br><br>2. There Is No Gravity In Space. The opening sequence features bombers dropping explosives on a First Order dreadnought.<br><br>3. Snoke Is A Throwaway. In the last film JJ Abrams made a big deal out of this Snoke guy. Now I'm not a fellow who spends a lot of time googling<br>whether Snoke is actually Darth Plagueis or whether he's Mace Windu. But if you're going to build up a big baddie who has the power to seduce<br>Kylo Ren to the Dark Side completely override Rey's force abilities and threaten Luke you've got to tell us who the heck he is.<br><br>4. Kylo Ren Isn't Intimidating.<br><br>5. Rey's Backstory Sucks.<br><br>6. Luke's Weird Farmer Life Is Weird. Did we really need a whole day of Luke going around milking an alien seacow and drinking it?<br><br>7. Luke Is A Bad Teacher. Luke says that he's going to provide Rey three lessons. The lessons consist of him (1) telling her what the Force is (okay<br>we already knew that) (2) having her touch a rock and see the Dark Side (she's drawn in by it but not seduced). There is no third lesson<br><br>8. Celebrity Cameos Make No Sense. Laura Dern with purple hair? Benicio Del Toro stuttering? What are these people doing here?<br><br>9. Poe Dameron's Story Arc Is Foolish. Poe is supposed to be newfangled Han Solo. Fail. First off there is no new Han Solo. Second Poe is a<br>dolt. And Admiral Laura Dern working with Leia has a plan they could easily just tell Poe and solve half the conflict of the plot. Why keep it secret<br>from Poe? We never find out. Instead Poe runs around like a moron making stupid plans with Finn that have no actual effect on the plotline.<br><br>10. Finn's Storyline Is Useless. Finn should have died at the end of TFA. He should have died at the end of The Last Jedi. Instead he goes on a<br>random jaunt to Monte Carlo with aliens and then rides a bunch of camel/horse/kangeroos to freedom while street urchins cheer. It's godawful. Then<br>finally when he's about to do something useful Rose stops him from doing it. Why is he here again except to have awkward hugs with Rey?<br><br>11. Rose Is Useless. Rose is added to the plot to give Finn someone to travel with and develop awkward romance with. But her presence is simply<br>not useful. She doesn't do anything particularly special. She does give Finn a lecture about income inequality though. So I guess that's something.<br><br>12. The "slow speed" (in Star Trek terms sub-light) chase? seriously. "Fuel" has never been mentioned in 9 Star Wars movies (or the extended<br>universe or even the RPG). If Finn and Rose can jump away and back again the first order could have entered hyper space and jumped in front of<br>the rebel ships. Hell apparently they could have went to another star system (and maybe gambled and drank for awhile) and come back in front of<br>them or right next to them like Finn and stupid Rose.<br><br>13. Captain Phasma Is A Nothing. She's apparently a white woman who wears a cool suit and then Finn - a dude who five seconds ago was a<br>janitor - beats her. Welp.<br><br>14. Luke Shouldn't Have Been A Hologram. Turning Luke into Obi-Wan Kenobe for purposes of the reset makes some sense. But his death made<br>none. Why is it cool for Luke to survive a barrage from AT-ATs if he's not even there? Why is it cool for Luke to best Kylo Ren in a light saber battle if<br>(1) Rey has already done so and (2) Luke isn't even there? They easily could have brought Luke there and had him do exactly the same thing but<br>sacrifice himself - or perhaps just fade away in front of Kylo Ren.<br><br>15. The Powers Of The Force Aren't Magic. We learn that through the Force you can now hologram yourself places and that you can also survive<br>being thrown into space (Leia). Wut?<br><br>16. Light Speed Can't Be Used As A Weapon. You can't destroy ships by flying at them at light speed. If you could the entire first scene would have<br>been unnecessary (forget the bombers just shoot an X-wing through that dreadnought) and the Rebel Alliance could have taken down every Death<br>Star ever in the same way.<br><br>17. Why Would Luke Try To Kill Kylo? He tried to save Vader after Vader destroyed a planet and cut off his hand. He sensed good in him. He<br>senses evil in Kylo and for a moment wants to kill him? That seems like a mild stretch at best.<br><br>18. There Are No Interesting Characters Left Except For Kylo Ren. So now everybody's dead. Han's dead. Luke is dead. Leia was never that<br>interesting but Carrie Fisher died so Leia can't stick around for long. That means we're left with the new characters - which is the point since Star<br>Wars can't survive on nostalgia forever.

 This Movie is visually impressive and that's pretty much where the good things come to an end. <br><br>the plot does not make any sense throughout the entire movie old and new characters seem to be very inconsistent with what we have seen in the previous installations of the franchise and even character development is problematic with the exception of kylo ren. <br><br>rey appears to be the complete opposite of what was introduced to us just 2 years prior to this movie finn is a caricature of himself the new characters are so stereotypical and one-dimensional that it hurts and the biggest blunder is of course the complete deconstruction of luke skywalker's character one of the most iconic characters of the saga. <br><br>this marks the first time that i did not go to see a star wars movie at the theaters more than once and not because i hated it or out of spite but simply because we are talking about a boring movie that was not worth the effort and the money.<br><br>if anything this movie makes me see the prequels with even more nostalgia than ever before and should make everyone realize that not everyone can create a story as immersive and unique as george lucas. i wish they had given the franchise to dave filoni who did an excellent job with clone wars and rebels but it seems that selling toys and t-shirts and other merchandise is disney's number one priority since they bought the franchise a few years ago., 1.0,  John K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977162225/, March 12 2018, N/A
 This film brings a marked freshness to the Star Wars saga. The evolution of the character of Kylo Ren (portrayed masterfully by Adam Driver) is the true heart of the film firmly marking it as the next chapter in the Skywalker Saga. Hamill and Fisher provide the strongest portrayal of their iconic characters while Daisy Ridley starts to break free from some of the more wooden elements of her performance in The Force Awakens.<br><br>This is something truly original in terms of plot pacing and character development. It takes the saga in bold new directions with brave choices wonderful surprises and shocking moments. It pushes the boundaries of Star Wars to its limit while still remaining absolutely true to its roots in a galaxy far far away. <br><br>I'd venture to say that its the strongest cinematic entry in the franchise to date. It's an absolute must-see and deserves multiple viewings., 5.0,  James S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/960135561/, March 12 2018, N/A

 Where to Start with this film....The Last jedi was an attempt by Rian Johnson to make a sequel to the force awakens (a film with its own share of problems but manages to be a good EXPERIENCE overall). I say attempt because this movie creates more problems than it solves. It manages to destroy any potential from the first film and instead has everything from useless scenes that should have been cut from the film and reshot to illogical reasoning on why certain decisions were made. The actions sequence were done well enough is the only redeeming quality to this film. Quite literally if you appreciate the original trilogy do not watch this if you liked george lucas's episodes 1-3 do not watch this film. If have not seen episode 1-7 watch this film but even then IDK if you will like it., 1.5,  Allen W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/820073005/, March 12 2018, N/A

 Sadly the parts I liked the most had none of the original Characteres in it and wre all the new characters. Except Chewie who I still loved.. But Rei Luke and Kylo all had no soul and honeslty felt like there were written by someone who was just writing what they thought should happen rather then coming from a personal place that showed real humanity. IT was wooden at best souless fake depth far too often. However giving it three stars for the moments when some of the other characters made me have nestalgia and felt like they were back in that original Fighter bay or magical world with amazing creatures. Can understand why die hard fans were hard on it though it definitely lacked any real continuation of the characters outline in the original three movies.

 Well The Force Awakens was clearly the last Star wars movie. Between that and TLJ complete Disneyfication appears to have occurred. I genuinely spent the first ten minutes thinking it was some kind of Star Wars spoof. the scripting is lazy and poor like they just couldn't be bothered and the jokes are so far off what original Star Wars humour was that they may as well have come from another galaxy. I love Ade Edmondon but in Star Wars? No. Too well known and too associated for me at least with absurdist humour to blend into the SW universe. I have been a huge fan of star wars since 1977 and was very pleasantly surprised by the Force Awakens despite my initial concerns. TLJ is the first 'Star Wars' film I had to turn off half way through. Star Wars it is not.

 As it has always been the visual effects and musical score were impressive and exciting. That is roughly the end of the positive aspects of the film. I'm not going to go into every single problem with the film within it's own 2 hour continuity within it's continuity errors from it's own prequel or with it's continuity errors in relation to the entire saga before it but I will say this: It felt rushed. The entire film takes place over a 24 hour span of time and they tried to do way too much in it while simultaneously doing very little. This Is a film that DID not learn from the mistakes of it's predecessors. You want us as an audience to like your characters? Give us time to. You want us to root for them to overcome their challenges? Actually make them challenging. You want to tear down our heroes? Make it believable. You want us to feel like your villains are real and threatening? Don't make them bumbling idiots. The audience understands as they walk into a film that there will be a certain amount of suspended disbelief. We know that we CAN'T walk outside and point our hand at something and it will float to us. But when the movies before yours have established how gravity in space Works how shields work how turrets or guns on a ship work Don't tell us suddenly that it works completely different. Don't have your captain say "our turrets can't hit their small ship because it's too close" then 2 scenes later say "we have to recall OUR fighters or their turrets will blow them up." Don't have your character say "it's impossible to track through hyperspace!" Then say 2 scenes later "Hey I know where the machine is that tracks through hyperspace because I used to mop right outside it." Don't advertise a fan favorite character like admiral Ackbar and then kill him after half a line of dialogue. We're not stupid. We know you put him in the commercial just to get us hyped and then you killed him without so much as a RIP. Don't make us have to reason out every scene for it make sense. Don't make us write the script for you. You don't want to explain in dialogue what's going on? That's fine. We don't want that either. We want you to show us. We came to watch this movie and escape reality and your multiple continuity errors are jarring for the experience. Please Disney make better films and people will give you more money.

 This film is a big disappointment. There is no intelligent fresh plot. No epicness that LUCAS's movies had. they just use what we saw before and add some lousy job script in between. They just assumed that in every movie they are going to kill one of the original heroes - heroes loved by billions heroes that made star wars great. and there is nothing to replace them. new heroes are cheap flat they will be quickly forgotten. disney should have left lucas legacy alone and try to create their own cult. but no they decided to make these predictible miserable movies destroy star wars upset fans and earn some dollars. thank you for destroying star wars disney i will never again go to cinema to see star wars movie and i will never again buy a product related to this franchise that is my way to protest. new star wars team has the money but don't have the knowledge and skills to make star wars as great as lucas was able to make them. it is a cheap movie with star wars logo attached., 0.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977162716/, March 13 2018, N/A

 Bafflingly bad. This film took everything about the first film that had any promise and destroyed it. And it did so with a toxic mix of self-righteous glee and appallingly bad execution. <br><br>One INTERESTING though I'm almost certain accidental feature of the film is that Luke's treatment of Rey is a microcosm of the movie's treatment of its audience. Luke heaps mocking scorn on Rey's ambitions those same ambitions that the audience was led to believe would drive this new trilogy. Thus the film belittles the audience itself - "Oh you thought this story would develop the plot lines and themes introduced in the first film? You thought we might answer a few questions and create larger ones? Like a second movie in a trilogy ought to do? You're just a simple-minded child like Rey who doesn't understand how thing work these days." <br><br>And yet I do no think that this disrespect of the audience was intentional. I think it was done out of sheer incompetence which almost makes it worse. Johnson thought that he was taking Star Wars in an exciting new direction by challenging audience expectations and shattering dusty old tropes. He thought he was breathing life into an old franchise in a way that "The Force Awakens" had not done. However there is a difference between an "exciting new take" on an old franchise and destroying the franchise because you don't understand what is and isn't vital to its greatness. <br><br>This film would be like if Netflix suddenly dropped a new season of "Friends" and Chandler and Rachel were murdered by terrorists in the first episode. Its a bold new take! Yeah but it also completely changes the nature of the story ruins classic old characters and shatters the audience's interest. <br><br>To top it off and I'm not going to get into this in detail the "new direction" storyline was not even executed well. To stick with the "Friends" analogy it would be like if after Chandler and Rachel die the rest of the season focuses mostly on Phoebe shopping for dining room tables and then in the last episode everyone suddenly meets up and declares that they are still friends. <br><br>Just terrible.

 Dear god what a train wreck. I didn't like what they did to Han in the last movie but you know I can accept it. Atleast it wasn't him randomly going out for no reason. But Luke christ. The way they did him was terrible. They could have David Carradine'd him in the cave and it would have been more interesting. Same with Admiral Akbar. Why? I mean why? Why are you crapping on all the legacy characters? Now the only one that is left is Leia and Carrie Fisher is dead. Can't wait for that CGI catastrophe. All the new characters you made even worse than the first. I loved Finn in TFA. He was an everyman. Ex-Storm Trooper and sanitation worker. Wasn't really good at anything but showed progression as the film went on. He had struggles and that's what made him interesting. Rey wasn't interesting in the first because she was so Mary Sue but my god does this movie make it even worse. With no training she is about to defeat any obstacle that is thrown before her and even use force powers that took Luke years to learn. Finally the worse thing was Admiral Purple Hair. Her character made no sense and was a terrible leader. Literally a third of the movie was caused by her incompetence and it was the worst part. Atleast she is dead so I don't have to see her stupidity in the next film if I decide to even watch it., ni,  Nicholas T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/939157828/, March 13 2018, N/A

Princess leia flying through space...awful. Bombs falling from a ship in space  awful the fear of ships running out of fuel while moving in space...awful. so many things were just badly presented and poorly written however one of the biggest problems is the lack of character arc for new characters and the shameful way older characters were treated. admiral holdo could have been great but was a one dimensional character that was basically a bit rubbish at her job.phasma should be a legendary character in star wars but was wasted by a writer who has no clue what to do with her. Finn  had no growth in this movie at all rey is somehow amazing at everything which is fine but doesnt make me like her as she has not had to work or suffer for anything. rose.....a complete and utter non character that to be fair was a complete waste of time in the film she did one thing in the entire movie and that was the wrong thing. the sub plot of rose and finn added so much time to the movie but absolutely nothing else it was completely pointless the film could have been cut by 40 minutes and no one would have noticed. Rey and kylo are not interesting at this stage rey is a magical force wizard and kylo is neither one thing or the other. the thing that i found the most odd was the treatment of the luke skywalker character. the character that had so much faith in others that he was willing to sacrifice himself for a belief that his father  the evil lord vader had some goodness and was in fact proved right in this. yet in this movie he is willing to consider murdering his sister and best friends child because he thinks he may be bad.....really and the way the character ends is the epitome of lazy writing. now many people may think i am a star wars fanboy i am not ....in fact i walked out of the cinema while watching the original star wars in the 70s when i was about 12 .i only started to appreciate the franchise in my later years. i do not collect the movies or toys but do enjoy a good movie. i enjoyed &lt the force awakens despite it being drivative i enjoyed rogue one i really did not enjoy the last jedi and the fault is not with the actors or the special effects crew or those who invested their cash to make the movie. no the faults in this movie lie squarely with the writers and the director. this was not just a bad star wars movie but is actually bad movie fullstop., 0.5,  Darren P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977163250/, March 13 2018, N/A

 I grow up with the original saga. always loved the story since a little boy. i was so exited when the prequels got announced. watch them and didn't care much about them. I can even say that i enjoy the prequels at some degree. <br>the force awakens was a new hope with a twist. it was a reboot that introduces us with new heroes and villains. <br>the last jedi was really a big DISAPPOINTMENT. i felt mistreated as a fan. i can't tell here what things i didn't like because it would be to long. <br>i won't buy any merchandise from this movie and i'm sad to say that i won't be going pay to see star wars 9 or any new release. <br>they went to far and some things can't be undone., 0.5,  leandro c, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977162982/, March 13 2018, N/A

 Thank you for the Friends analogy Mike S. Very astute. It made me think of another analogy and inspired me to create an account and give my very first review on Rotten Tomatoes. <br><br>I agree with what many others have said about the countless super annoying plot holes and inconsistencies. I also agree that the movie is a visual masterpiece. Absolutely stunning. What I'd like to expand on are some of the reasons this movie is an astounding failure in storytelling.<br><br>I'm a 40-year-old woman. I fell in love with Star Wars as a kid not so much because of the space battles light saber fights and force mythology but because of the story. For me it was about the relationships between the characters. Han and Leia's love story Luke's emotional and tragic relationship with his father Luke's friendships with R2D2 and Yoda Luke and Leia's discovery of their family bond Han and Lando's friendship betrayal and reconciliation the bond between R2D2 ad C3PO even the twisted and codependent relationship between the Emperor and Darth Vader. The characters were made real through their relationships with each other and they became like old friends who I have loved and held dear for many many years. I think the film critics who praise The Last Jedi don't understand the strong emotional connection that so many of us have with the old characters. They also don't seem to understand the need to build that kind of connection with new characters. <br><br>To help explain let's pretend that some much anticipated sequels to Lord of the Rings were made picking up the story 40 years later. After the second movie this is what we have:<br><br>Aragorn didn't like being tied down with the responsibilities of being King of Gondor so he left Arwen and the little boy they had to go be a Ranger of the North again. <br><br>That little boy growing up without a dad and a brokenhearted mom starts thinking about moving into Mordor to restart the Orc breeding program. <br> <br>Sam gets wind of this and moseys on down to Gondor to kill him in his sleep. Sure his devotion to Frodo never wavered even as Frodo was slowing consumed by the evil of the One Ring but that was then this is now. Sam is older and grumpy (I guess?) and can't be bothered to help redeem anyone. <br><br>He decides at the last minute not to kill Aragorn's son and instead of hanging around to try to help him he runs off to the Paths of the Dead under the mountain to wallow in pity and drink cave troll milk/semen.<br><br>Arwen and Aragorn's son continues to become bad (because some random guy with no backstory came along and said "Hey you wanna be evil?" and he said "OK sure!") He sets up shop in Mordor rebuilding Barad Dur and sending orcs to pillage and destroy the countryside. He destroys Gondor and Rohan and eventually makes his way to the Shire. <br><br>Aragorn comes to the Shire to confront his son but he's killed by him in a few minutes.<br><br>Arwen has now lost her son and the love of her life and is crushed and broken. <br><br>Some new characters that we started to care about after the first movie but are now flat and boring finally locate Sam in the Paths of the Dead to try to convince him to come help them defeat the bad guy (who remember was once that sweet little boy running through the woods in Arwen's vision) becasue he's about to kill Sam's whole family up in Hobbiton. Sam says "Naw I think I'll just stay here and roll around in the piles of skulls." <br><br>The new characters give up and head to Hobbiton to try to save it. When they arrive only three hobbit holes remain with a handful of hobbits hiding inside them. The rest of the Shire is completely destroyed and most of the hobbits are dead. Thankfully Rosie and the kids are still alive. <br><br>Meanwhile as the Hobbits are fighting for their lives one of the annoying Sackville-Bagginses turns up to lecture everyone about how income inequality and animal cruelty run rampant in the Shire. They also reveal that Merry and Pippin and the other rich hobbits have gotten rich by selling weapons to both the Shire and Mordor. (??? so why do we care about saving the Shire if it's so corrupt?)<br><br>At the last moment Sam magically astral-projects himself (because everyone can have the power of elves now) to Hobbiton to distract the little-boy-turned-evil-monster-for-no-reason so that the remaining Hobbits and the new characters we don't care about can escape to Bree. The Shire burns to the ground.<br><br>Sam dies because he's tired.<br><br>The End<br><br><br>So much for our beloved characters of Sam Aragorn and Arwen. And so much for the peaceful Middle Earth they fought to create and the Shire they fought to protect. It turned out to be as corrupt as present day America. So what's the point? What are we fighting for in this new trilogy? The critics who never had any emotional connection to the characters in LOTR no reverence for Middle Earth or nostalgia for the Shire think the movie is wonderful and edgy and pushing the story in a brave new direction. The millions of LOTR fans who are upset are labeled buttsore fanboys.<br><br>I loved The Force Awakens even though I was crushed by Han Solo's death. I cared about the new characters and their new story arcs and I understood what was done with Han. His story arc was actually pretty believable (who really thought he'd be content being a general in the new Republic or whatever for the rest of his life? He's Han Solo after all). And I understood the need for him to die. It solidified the evil in Kylo Ren. I figured the second movie would flush out Snoke's character and make us understand how he managed to corrupt Ben Solo giving further weight to Han's death and Leia's heartbreak. Buuuut nope. Instead we start from scratch again trying to convert Kylo this time by FaceTiming with a cute girl. I actually liked those scenes because they developed the only real relationship between two characters that this movie has but they also cheapened Han's death. If Kylo is still wavering after killing his own father (who is also one of our most beloved characters!) then what was the point of that death? Especially since we end the movie with Kylo going all evil again just like at the end of the first movie. <br><br>And of course it goes without saying that Luke was completely done wrong start to finish. The respect for the old characters that was so evident in The Force Awakens is gone in The Last Jedi. No one would tolerate such treatment of Aragorn Arwen and Sam. <br><br>On top of that the interest in the new characters is flattened because there are no real relationships between any of them. The budding friendship between Finn and Po is not progressed Rey's friendships with Finn and BB8 are put on hold Rey and Po don't even meet until the end of the movie. Kylo and Snoke's relationship comes to an abrupt and not-so-believable end. The tension between Kylo and Hux is gone because Hux is comic relief now. All the emotional connections set up in The Force Awakens are gone. <br><br>There is also no progression in the overall story of Star Wars we're right back to where it all started. Small group of rebels fighting a big evil force. I don't understand all the talk about breaking tropes and branching out into new territory. There's no new storyline. We are literally back to the very beginning with characters we don't know very well fighting an evil force that arose for reasons we don't understand. And just to make it worse this time they're fighting to preserve a Republic that we now know is actually an oligarchy rife with injustice. Yay! Go rebels! (Don't even get me started on the lameness of injecting current modern day social justice issues into Star Wars. It's so jarring and just plain wrong no matter how much I may agree with the sentiments politically)<br><br>If there were some tangible emotional relationships between the new characters and some movement in the overall story some new direction with something interesting to look forward to then it might have tempered our sadness at the degradation of the old characters. At least there would be a reason for it. Something to make us understand the need for it and come to terms with it. But there isn't. It was all for nothing. These characters were degraded and given tragic endings for the sole purpose of "subverting expectations." That is failed story telling., 1.0,  A P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977163148/, March 13 2018, N/A
 Episode 8 is ambitious. It's not the film you'd expect at this point from Star Wars and for that I respect it. Rian Johnson was relentenlessy determined to tell his own story one that doesn't cater to Star Wars fandom.

 Simply put this is the best Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back and contains some of the best writing and acting of the entire franchise. In many ways it is the best Star Wars movie period with a great deal more sophistication and layers of depth than Star Wars fans might be used to (and I believe this is what generated a large number of complaints from fans who were just looking for a simple action movie that satisfied the basic "fan theories"). Much of what happens in the movie is unexpected even subversive and this is what generates such great interest and gives it real gravity. There is a great deal of subtext again more than fans might be used to and it takes repeated viewings to really gather everything together and understand the various character arcs. The entire film is expertly executed with truly excellent cinematography (again including the kinds of shots we haven't seen in a Star Wars movie before) and outstanding visual effects. Even the movie's critics must admit it's a truly beautiful movie to lay eyes on. Mark Hamill gives a career-best performance as Luke and the chemistry between Daisy Ridley's Rey and Adam Driver's Kylo Ren is sizzling. There was a point about 2/3rds of the way through that I was gripping my seat with genuine suspense over a key character decision something that frankly has not happened to me during a Star Wars movie before. And fear not the action in this movie is some of the best in any Star Wars movie. I especially found the battle between Rey Ren and the Praetorian Guards to be breathtaking.<br><br>My advice for new viewers: put all your theories behind you and watch with open eyes and an open mind. Expect the unexpected and don't expect the movie to spoon-feed you what you wanted or to answer every question about every character. This is a grounded movie that takes realistic turns and avoids cliches. I for one was thankful that in this movie everyone important isn't related to someone else who is important a tired Star Wars cliche that wore out its welcome way back in 1983 when it was revealed that Leia was Luke's sister. Such groan-inducing situations are entirely absent in this movie and in many ways are subverted. I was also glad that the characters strayed significantly from their expected paths because simply doing what was expected would have been a dull affair indeed. Director Rian Johnson understands how to create and build true drama and by the end of this film I felt emotionally drained in the best possible way - I felt like I'd been on a journey with these characters watching them change and grow for better or for worse.<br><br>A lot of the movie's critics are judging it as a "Star Wars movie" and spend most of their criticism on nitpicking story points. On that level alone it may disappoint some that it doesn't do what's expected of a Star Wars movie. Even though I'm a Star Wars fan I'm judging it as a movie period and as a movie it works in every way that you want a movie to work. Star Wars has been around long enough that it's collected quite a rogue's gallery of cliches and stereotypes and it was a tall order to subvert all of those to create genuine interest and drama an order that Johnson and Co. succeeded at in spades. The bottom line: this is a great movie that I believe will come to be appreciated more and more and J.J. Abrams has his work cut out for him in directing the follow-up. I wish him the best of luck because this movie deserves a sequel worthy of its merits., 4.5,  Mike K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/860033511/, March 13 2018, N/A

 Sadly It's Not Worth Buying or Renting...<br>The Last Jedi is a movie you'll want to wait and watch for free on TV or at a friend's house. It's not even worth buying from the $5 bin. I saw it twice in the theaters and there are plenty of valid reasons why this movie is hovering around 3 stars - far too many to explain here. In short the story is full of major inconsistencies contradictions and irrationalities in comparison to not only the previous Star Wars trilogies but to The Force Awakens and to itself. These kinds of problems can be found in any film (including all previous Star Wars films) but The Last Jedi is filled to the brim with them. Yes the cinematography is beautiful the special effects are amazing the sound and music are great and the acting is well-performed but all of that cannot make up for the poorly-written story which is where this movie falls flat on its face. The script really needed to go through some major revisions before being given the green light to be filmed. It's a shame that a lot of money and a lot of people's talents went into making such a poorly-written script.

 If you grew up on Star Wars if you watched Luke defy the Emperor and turn Darth Vader you cannot in good conscience accept The Last Jedi. Unfortunately the movie wasn't just a bad Star Wars movie it was a bad movie. It was disjointed the plot lead no where. The viewer is left to ask time and again what was that scene supposed to show me? The dialogue was straight out of a tween cartoon. The performances were subpar by several of the actors. Laura Dern was clearly there simply as a Star Wars fan. The story failed to maintain any semblance of the true personality and depth of existing characters. It was just bad.<br><br>Luke Skywalker sacrifices himself to....... help a few escape? That's it? The Luke Skywalker powerful enough to turn Darth Vader against the Emperor essentially saves a small group of ... what are they the Resistance Rebels or what? The New Republic founded after the fall of the Empire (Post ROTJ) would've been much larger than a handful of planets or systems. Yet somehow the First Order which we are lead to believe is the remnants of the military arm of the Empire under new leadership in The Force Awakens (TFA) is so organized and resourced that it is essentially back in charge.<br><br>But I ramble the movie was bad the entire plot thread involving Finn and newcomer Rose was completely meaningless and introduced a half hearted attempt at romance. The Rose character was weakly performed. All it did was make the movie longer and maybe save Finn from himself to teach a lesson? Equally useless was Poe why would he suddenly become an Uber hot-head? Even Han Solo knew when to be a team player. He may be a gunslinger but he is also an officer in the military and this isn't Mav and Goose in Top Gun. In the end that plot line adds little if anything to the story. Seriously what was the point of Laura Dern's character? Anyone could've played that role and why did the plan have to be secret?<br><br>The Force Wakens was an applauded movie one I enjoyed but it was a rehash of A New Hope. What it had going for it was simple it was vastly superior to the Prequel Trilogy. What Rian Johnson did to the Star Wars story wasn't a simple rehash. He basically took the entire original trilogy and threw it out the victory over the Emperor was meaningless. Luke Skywalker was meaningless the Skywalker legacy was meaningless. A New Hope and the Rescue of Leila completely pointless. All you had to know as a viewer was that once a band of rebels defeated the Empire thus creating the First Order.<br><br>There are so many issues with this film starship fuel really? But Luke's X-Wing can make it to Degobah and Ahch-To? I would think ships that size would be nuclear or beyond where did the Death Star fuel up? The contradictions are rife in the film. A flagship intended to direct and support long range combat would not have a fuel issue.<br><br>The Force continues to be distorted. Ben Kenobi described it as an energy field created by all living things surrounding penetrating and binding all living souls in the galaxy (Star Wars A New Hope). But here we see further attempts to define ownership and usage of the force. Similar to a video game. But the Force couldn't heal Darth Vader's lungs yet Leia can somehow untrained survive space? I sat up like a bolt in the theatre and looked around to see who bought that shenanigan delivered by Johnson I wasn't alone. I'm told in books she is trained but when is that during her breaks from building a government and running a military? The Force is a natural phenomenon not magic. It isn't a Force Punch Force Push or Force Lightning as some describe its uses. It is simply those trained and sensitive accessing its existence.<br><br>The Force contradictions are absurd its one thing to suspend logical belief for amusement it's another to establish so many contradictions. Snokes strength in the Force could not save himself from a light saber right next to him and yet he can telepathically connect two minds across the galaxy and read both of their thoughts? It seems whenever poor plot was revealed either a piece of magic was suddenly available or suddenly nonexistent.<br><br>The character usage is awful. Chewie is a bit character that isn't mourning Han Solo at all Rey is a nobody apparently that needs three classes to master all the Force and Kylo/Ben is a spoiled brat on a temper tantrum. One who couldn't lead a band of clowns in a circus let alone a huge military. In the end who Snoke was didn't matter how Snoke got to Kylo didnt matter Beyond Snoke what turned Kylo? Who are the Knights of Ren?<br><br>Who organized the First Order from the remnants of the Military? What systems support the First Order many few? Why is another whimpering whiner who could be a recent college graduate a General with the First Order? Star Wars is a caricature of itself now and the kids are running the story.

 Disappointment doesn't begin to describe my experience in watching this film. Rian Johnson's depiction and treatment of Luke was very disheartening. I would strongly dispute Mr. Johnson's claim that he is a Star Wars fan. I share many of the same opinions regarding Luke already shared here and agree with Mark Hamill's comments regarding his thoughts on how Luke was portrayed. I also agree with many regarding the story and forced attempt at humor. For the first time ever I'm not looking forward to future installments of my once favorite series. After seeing this film with friends on opening night I was not looking forward to taking my family to see it the following day but I had already purchased the tickets or I wouldn't have seen it the next day again. Disney apparently lacked confidence in their ability to move the story forward for new characters without destroying the old characters. Disney has ruined my experience with Star Wars and for the first time ever I could care less about what's next for Star Wars...<br><br>now if this was the sequel for spaceballs then that is another story and my review would be much more positive as it was very funny at times with childish type humor., 1.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976972327/, March 11 2018, N/A
 Such a let down. Luke Skywalker was underdeveloped. The casino scenes were unnecessary and Del Toro's role added nothing. Yoda didn't look like Yoda. It was a mess. There were some good things but the back and forth between scenes and the jumping were sometimes jarring. I didn't feel any emotional tie with the characters at all. Luke's transcendence was ridiculous. I love all things Star Wars but this felt like an experimental film attempting to bridge a gap., 1.0,  Chad D, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/852925496/, March 11 2018, N/A
 Blame spam bots for low audience score yet they won't blame Dissssney on the tomatometer...Another year another disappointment. Another dragging the characters we loved through the mudd just to kill one off one movie at a time. Plenty of awesome pc stuff checked off so if you don't like this movie you are a racist sexist probably white pleb. The series has basically become the Call of duty for movies....Well actually there are a few others but this one has to be the biggest. The formula for Disney is pretty simple with this... Copy and paste the old movies slap on star wars and the force will be strong with the fanboys... Plenty of boredom plenty of pointless plots. More characters that die off for no good reason.

 Off the top of my head...Too many jokey gags. First Order and Resistance story line was boring and nonsensical. None of previous movie questions answered. None of the new characters are given much to do or developed past last film (Finn Poe Phasma Snoke). Luke is ruined without any reason that would match his past actions. His whole story seems contrived in order to just not give fans what they wanted. Everything seemed to be done to justify the next movie having zero to do with originals and not really telling a good story. Just terrible. They could have made a bad movie and still had hope for a good final episode nine but they did everything possible to ruin not just the last film but the original trilogy. This was just bad.

 Watching Star Wars: The Last Jedi was like reading the first pass of a junior fanfic writer's first 'proper' story. Scenes and dialogue happen because the script demands it and not because the characters and situation would naturally result in it. There is UNNECESSARY social commentary forced character and creature interactions universe breaking design elements side plots on side plots unimaginative story progression poorly written and executed humour massive character transgressions and little to no explanation for any of it. Literally The only thing I enjoyed was the depiction of the female A-wing pilot Talli who at least appeared to be the first truly competent female military figure (Apart from maybe that 1 x-wing pilot and other dialogue-less side characters) depicted within these new films and yet they kill her off within the first half hour. A complete waste of time and money to go and see a movie that strays so far from the source material its hard to remember it's even set in the same galaxy. No it's not a 0.5 star or 1 star movie there is some good special effects (not Yoda) and sometimes the music is okay (Although it's still not as memorable as the older stuff certainly no new 'Imperial March' level stuff this time) but it's all for nought when the writing and the direction of the movie was so terribly handled. So it's 1.5 stars from me a 3/10 movie.

 This movie is the worst Star Wars movie by a long way. trivialises and cheapens the force as a concept. treats the iconic character of luke skywalker appallingly for no reason other than to destroy this iconic archetypal male character and to lessen the inspiring quality of his hero's journey in the OT. this is post modern nihilistic garbage hiding behind some pretty cgi and social justice nonsense. i could go on but its all been said many times already. don't waste your money on the dvd when it's released., 1.0,  Tom C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977158787/, March 11 2018, N/A

 If I hadn't seen any other star wars movie I PROBABLY still wouldn't think this was an excellent film. There are some brilliant visually impressive moments and scenes. But THAT'S ABOUT it.

 VERY disappointing for such a once-great franchise. Honestly I can't understand how such a badly-written previeous-movies-and-lore-ignoring inconsistent mess can be praised as "The Best Star Wars Ever" by anyone.<br><br>Star Wars fan or not do all those positive reviewers truly not see the incoherency the plotholes the bad storytelling? Or is it really so that as long as the special effects are 'spectacular' and there is lots of 'action' and at least one or two profound-sounding phrases brain-dead viewers of today don't really need a story around it anymore? Hey that concept already proved true with "Mad Max - Fury Road" didn't it? But then we old-time fans should probably really leave the franchise to the next generation because I don't want to be part of it anymore.<br><br>The way this movie is done somehow reminds me of myself as a kid when I hit Big Jim action figures together to imitate dramatic combat without ever bothering to think up a good story around it or a reason why they were actually fighting as long as the fight as such felt 'cool'.<br><br>But that's what KIDS do. A multi-million dollar movie done by a person who is considered PROFESSIONAL and dealing with probably the greatest Sci-Fi franchise the world has seen to date should handle this a bit better I think? But it doesn't even feel as it the story was all planned out more as if they 'make up stuff from scratch' as they need it. <br><br>Disney was great once they had wonderful kid's cartoons and wonderful movies to entertain you. Today we only get cheap CGI and Flash Animator garbage from them that shows neither creativity nor talent nor heart behind it. It's sad when Disney leaves all that out just because they know the end product will sell either way just because it's a popular franchise name.<br><br>... one last thing:<br><br>What do you all think makes a Star Wars story so 'special'? Sure the space battles and laser sword fights are always outstanding highlights to watch. But for me to take "Force Awakens" as an example there was actually only ONE scene which truly stuck in my mind: the one with Rey and the scrap trader. She worked almost a day to salvage some gear from a shipwreck and gets no more than 1/4 ration for it. Then the scrap trader sees BB-8 and offers to give her no less than 40 full rations for the robot. Rey grabs for the pile in disbelief and her hands practically sink into it because it's so much probably more food than she has ever seen in her entire live an unbelievable treasure! And you want to call out to her "Take it take it! What do you care about a robot that you just met 10 minutes ago?" But even though the offer is so incredibly tempting Rey does decide against it and sticks with BB-8.<br><br>In my opinion especially *THIS* is what Disney does not seem to understand: a great deal of what makes the Star Wars lore so special is the decisions the characters make. Moments like Luke turning off his computer and deciding to trust in the Force instead when shooting the photon torpedo at the Death Star up to choosing the Light Side of the Force instead of giving in to the temptations of the easier ways of the Dark Side. Doing what you think is RIGHT not what is EASY even if you have to endure hardships and make sacrifices *THOSE* are the moments that are truly remembered in Star Wars the moments that become legend!

 The movie was long and a great reflection of the state of cinematic propaganda in the current year. Every member of the cast was engineered to fit modern-day feminist stereotypes. If your character was a white male well he was either a coward an obstinate blowhard or pathetic in some other way. The lesson I gleaned was that they were definitely undependable. If you were a male but not white well you were still inept and underhanded for the most part. The strong female roles were shining examples of empowered female leadership. If by shining examples you mean that you cannot get your underlings to follow your orders you're unable to inspire enough confidence in the mission to dissuade open mutiny and your every decision leads the resistance further and further away from any chance of a happy ending. The major plot-line of the movie had so many holes that the movie would only get 2-3 stars despite the good acting. I only took half a star away due to the feminist propaganda., ni,  kbradsha k, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/966413234/, March 7 2018, N/A
 Plot twists turned to plot anarchy. Ryan Johnson effectively throws out Chekov's gun principle in favor of the much more dictatorial "all that matters is what the writer thinks matters in this exact instant it might be forgotten or brushed off 20 minutes from now".<br><br>A lot of story logic and story direction was sacrificed to make the heroes as heroic as possible and the message the movie delivered as inspirational as possible. I appreciate the intent but Star Wars is a fantasy with some fable-like moments. Treating this movie (or any movie really) as a sacred text that teaches our kids morality is just presumptuous and unnecessary. There should be a balance here. <br><br>Mixing two generations of characters proved this trilogy's undoing. Not enough time was devoted to the new cast who got lost in the countless B-plot story lines and in the need to showcase Han. Luke and Leia. Love all the new heroes btw. <br><br>The SW OT was build on friendship and romance the PT on family. Even with all the special effects and action the relationships between the characters is what made these movies shone (some more than others). Our main cast in this movie has never spent any time all interacting with each other. Poe and Rey met in the last five minutes of the movie. The movie as a result is an emotional wasteland. Ditto for not thinking of a way for all the OT cast to get together for a scene in TFA however short the scene might be. This movie was an emotional wasteland. The New Yorker used the following adjectives to describe this bold new SW world: "abstemious de-mentalized militarized". I couldn't agree more.<br><br>I had no issue with how some classic elements from Star Wars were discarded or reinterpreted. However I have to say that putting such emphasis on these same elements (Anakin's lightsaber for example) in TFA and then literally tossing them aside was baffling to watch. I am not one bit surprised by fans angry about that just because of how these elements went from significant to who cares. If you really wanted to be bold Lucasfilm perhaps you shouldn't have brought these elements up in the first place. You can't have your cake and eat it too. Sorry!<br><br>Speaking of bold there were some interesting ideas in this movie. But somehow we ended up with an evil man in black armor with a red laser sword who is in command of a faceless army bent on subjugating the galaxy a rag tag team of rebels who resist him and all space tyrants. and a young inexperienced jedi who is helping the rebels. That sounds... familiar? Hopefully episode 9 does something unexpected with that set up.<br><br>The movie was profoundly unfunny. The only thing the quippy one liners achieved was to undercut the tension and diminish the story's impact. And the funny parts were not meant to be funny. Leia flying through space is not bad but the way they portrayed it was. The space chase was just Family Guy Star Wars or Space Balls level of absurdity. By all means show us new ways the force works! But the long-distance yet tangible force hologram was just distracting.<br><br>Heroes are as good as their villains. The First Order are caricatures. I guess that makes it more palatable for kids when they see the First Order ships carrying thousands of members of the First Order blow up.<br><br>I had no problem with the death of Han Solo or the fate of Luke Skywalker. But know we know the OT trio led sad strife-filled lives and never escaped the conflict that formed them as human beings in their youth. It's like their hope and dreams were crushed with age until it was time for them to pass. That's a very nihilistic statement that anyone who is currently under 25 will have the pleasure of discovering as they re-watch the movies in the future.<br><br>I just can't see how the movie is nuanced. The bad guys are badder than ever. The good guys are more heroic than ever. It's good vs evil light vs. dark. Nuance never did play a role in this universe. Lets not fool ourselves that it does now.<br><br>The special effects were very nice but 99% of all the vehicles and even of many aliens were just tweaked designs we have seen before.<br><br>Ryan Johnson I am still a fan :). Maybe both sides on this debate will reassess their position and we will meet half way.<br><br>That said the entertainment media's reaction to any negative opinions about the movie has been sad to witness., 3.5,  Jiva D, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/789561420/, March 7 2018, N/A

 I guess I'm part of the problem I went to see this the weekend it opened taking my whole family. Why? Because it's a Star Wars obviously.<br>This will not happen again.<br><br>Why did i hate it? Firstly the humour The scene with Hux and Poe completely undermined the menace of the first order reducing Hux to a bumbling fool. Second the weird admonishment of Poe a character we the audience (or certainly the male contingent) are invested in for doing his job properly. I mean what difference would withdrawing sooner have made? There would just be more guns and Tie Fighters to destroy the "Bombers". Third the bombers themselves.

 Worst Star wars movie ever., 0.5,  Vira I, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977152569/, March 7 2018, N/A
 I doubt I'm alone in this but I've seen a lot of bad movies in my life and it usually turns into bewildered laughter or just becomes forgettable the next day. This is the first movie I've ever walked away from and became angry which didn't make sense at first and many just said "It's just a movie".<br><br>To all the people saying "It's just a movie"... movies TV &amp music are the biggest forms of entertainment. Now imagine your #1 brand of entertainment having the heart felt storytelling replaced with stupidity and SJW tones. Now realize that Star Wars is the #1 brand of movie entertainment in history. This means that if Hollywood is willing to destroy the #1 brand to make a political statement that means all other brands are now likely to follow. People use entertainment to get away from the 6 o'clock news and real life senseless tragedies. So Star Wars is ruined today and all forms of entertainment tomorrow.<br><br>This is why this movie has made me so angry... it's the beginning of the end of escapism entertainment. The future of movies is political allegories with no soul for the brand. For example watch the new X-Files Star Trek Discovery etc. They are all turning into soulless political allegories. Good bye Star Wars and good bye future escapism entertainment.<br><br>I have no respect for you Hollywood Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson. I had hope in JJ Abrams but he's now on the bandwagon that people who didn't like this Star Wars don't like feminism. You're an idiot JJ. I love Kill Bill Wonder Woman and many other women led movies but they are all great stories without political allegories.

 What the hell Disney what the hell. (Not yelled just calmly said in disbelief) <br>So I went to see this hoping to see the next chapter of the Skywalker saga to see WHat and who Snoke was to see the NEXT CHAPTER of an epic.<br> What i got was an social justice warrior speach about woman good man bad the rich enslave the poor im surprised they (you disney) couldn't find a way to put the gun control agenda into it. <br> And 2 there was no story. I could tell you what happend. But THERE was no story. What should have been SEVERAL slamdunks were lost. <br> Snoke sith no one knew existed. THAT'S it... you want more ok i saw a guy in a gold bath robe with ALl the menace OF a unwilling cat you just gave a bath to. Force awakens mysterious and threating. Last jedi ???<br>General Hux. Force AWAKENS a force to be RECkoned with. Last jedi CLOWN well i guess jar jar had to make an appearance somewhere.<br>Captain phasma. Didn't she die in force AWAKENS? Ok sure why not falls down again? <br>Rose. Why is she even in this story? What role does she fill? Finns love interest? I thought that was who Poe was.<br>Finn. I actually had no problem with him just his story arc.<br>POE ok you could have done more with him and the mutiny. Although it was funny when leia shot him. <br>Rey. Good at everything. Mary sue much? Insert bad fanfiction character here. No flaws. Knows everything. Until she doesn't. BEATS kylo in a lightsaber duel. Beats luke in a duel. KILLS 4 highly trained guards. Flys the falcon expertly with no previous experience. Heck put her in a xwing and the new order would run for the hills. <br>General Holdo. Could you have made it any MORE<br> obvious that she was BASed off of big red (a feminist ACTIVIST) and At times it was like her and leia had more the just a friendly intrest in each other. <br> I feal that they really dropped the ball here or rather in the force AWAKENS i think it would have been really touching to see luke leia and han together in a FINAL SCENE. <br>I can give you the whole leia mary poppins scene lukes sister give her some training. Sure. <br>Luke what happend? He was this bright light in the galaxy he could see the tiny spark in darth vader brought him back to the light. Oh one of my students is haveing dark side THOUGHTS i BETTER kill him.What?! His death ??? <br><br>On the WHOLE the movie lacked menace only the m6 <br>walkers had any. The movie is bad. Go see it if you must. Better yet wait for it on youtube or netflix your not missing anything. There is only one way to fix this mess. But carrie fisher is dead so a reshoot or reboot of the force AWAKENS and last the JEDI are out. So a retcon is needed i just hope THEse movies goes the way of the Christmas special And THAt they are lost to the anals of time.

 THE FORCE LEFT THE FRANCHISE WITH THIS film. it managed to un do everything the Force awakens started. First I will say that it did have good CINEMATOGRAPHY MUSIC acting and action. The shows were BEAUTIFULLY filmed music was on point and all the actors did their best. Now everything else was bad. It had no REVERENCE for the past too many plot holes no continuity with the last film a side quest that derailed the film force political message poor pacing went out of it's way to piss off the fans and worst of all the film was boring. Luke and Leia's characters were butchered beyond RECOGNITION Rey got turned into a merry sue Hux got lobotomized Finn does nothing in the film rose prevents finn from doing anything poe gets screwed over and holdo is the worst character in the film. I get what this film was going for but the delivery left a lot to be desired. i was left with a deeper DISAPPOINTMENT than I got with the Prequels. this film actually made those three films look good by comparison.

 I'm not a winy geek-crazy fan (altho I've been quite fond of SW since I was 6).<br>With that being said the hype for the movie was real I trusted the director and loved his other movies.<br>Well after a few minutes into the movie something felt odd. The comedic style was terrible and so forced down the viewer's throats.<br>Storytelling was awful non linear and completely look over what was laid there in ep 7.<br>Changes are good I loved Rogue One and the characters development in Ep 7 was fantastic and got me so involved with the new generation of SW protagonists.<br>But this...everyone was off Rose was there as a forced happy-comic disney cartoon character. SOme sequences are so useless and make no damn sense.<br>I'm glad that some people enjoied the movie I'm actually jelous!<br>After the screening was over I felt sad and disapointed the urge to go back home and snuggle with my saber was huge.

 good addition to the Star Wars universe this is a good movie like FA but i think cracks are beginning to show. The movie picks up where TFA left off the rebels are going up against the first order there is no question that the last 40 minutes is jam packed out of your seat action it has a great conclusion for movie characters its fun and funny able to laugh at itself with a few tongue in cheek comments and most importantly it has a good message at the end...its not about blood its about heart and this movie has plenty of it. It also shows us that the Star Wars universe is opening up giving us a more mature presentation and characters in grey not black and white. Luke finally has some interesting lines he is a character that is no longer just the bubbly optimistic kid but an older Jedi that has regrets and disappointments. Much of the controversy surrounding Jedi in my conversation are about the interpretation of characters like Luke I think that what we are seeing is a more complex understanding of human nature and I think its makes for a good movie. the one concern I have is that at places it seemed like the movie was too stuffed too jammed pack and too manufactured. it seemed to be a combo of a remake of empire/jedi with scenes like the emperor battle/rey ren battle etc my concern continues to be the series ability to launch into something new and not just the same thing we are used to seeing on the screen., 3.5,  Oliver G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976979342/, March 10 2018, N/A

 Definitely one of the worst star wars films. awful script ignoring most of the ideas that had been developed in the original and prequel trilogies. worst of all this was just a mix up of scenes and story lines from empire and a few from return of the jedi. we start with the rebels evacuating a planet from an attack by the first order - oh thats sounds like a story line from empire!! later rey believes that kylo can be redeemed - just as luke originally thought darth vader could be redeemed in jedi. the scene with snoke in his throne room is also a bad version of the EMPERORS plan in jedi only this time is seems that it was a lucky COINCIDENCE as opposed to the well set up plan of the emprorer to fool the rebels into a false attack. finally we see atats attacking a rebel base - oh yes thats the BEGINNING of empire again. <br><br>there is also the strange timeline the rey/luke story seems to take days but the rebels being chased by the first order seems to be only a day!<br>and the mystery of reys parents - oh thats a bit like empire when we find out that darth vader is actually lukes father. no real need for this story line in force awakens or this one. <br>as others have said this has destroyed the trilogy for me the way the force is now just for anyone to pick up when until now it took years of training to become a jedi now for no good reason it takes a few minutes of wanting to be able to use it to become a jedi!!! <br>too much political correctness in this film. <br><br>it is very sad that the same organisation that brought us the brilliant rogue one - the best star wars film since jedi - could also produce such rubbish., 0.5,  Daniel T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977157713/, March 10 2018, N/A

 I completely understand the hate this movie has RECEIVED over the last few months but I disagree with some of the hate. I love this movie. it's one of my favorite star wars movies to date. to me I rank this movie right behind the episode V.<br><br>rian johnson attempted to break the star wars formula that has existed for the last 40 years and personally he succeeded in an amazing way. <br><br>he took the one note characters that have become boring over the years and transformed them into these complex humans that could exist and ADMIT their own mistakes. Luke skywalker can't MAINTAIN this INFALLIBLE persona that everyone has known for years. He needed to become this Luke Skywalker. he points out the faults of the jedi order that the PREQUELS attempted to portray. he knows and understands the problem that the jedi order represents. it says in the movie that the jedi are only an idea. you don't need the name to be a good person. that is something that parents try ot tell their kids for years. you don't need to be apart of an ORGANIZATION to do something important or good. you just need to be good. <br><br>yes snoke was slightly wasted in the movie. he was killed off earlier than i expectedbut it helps kylo complete his character arc in an impressive way. it was an HOMAGE to the FANTASTIC vader arc. he survives his predecessor and instead of following in anakin's footsteps he creates his own. he take over the empty void that was left behind. plus if you remember when episode vi originally came out we knew nothing about the EMPEROR and he was killed off that movie. the prequels and the clone wars FLESHED out sidius's character. without those cannon series we knew nothing about him. <br><br>i know i didn't touch on all the problems that people have with this movie but i hope i SHED light on a few EXPLANATIONS for the problems that you may have had with the movie. i still love this movie and think that this is one of the best. also i hope that soon you'll be able to enjoy the movie as much as i do., 4.5,  Drew Z, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977157635/, March 10 2018, N/A

 this movie is simply...a piece of shit and that 90% from the critics is a joke. the story alone nobody with a leveled head could give it a passing mark. there was no connection to the previous film in any way. i thought you were supposed to build upon the characters in the first one? RJ is such a hack a toddler couldve written a better script. where was the development interesting arcs etc? no i get a handful of new characters who nobody gives a shit about horrendous kiddy jokes and humiliation of previously loved characters. Forget luke because i could write a thesis on where his character didnt make sense but what about finn Snoke Phasma hux and kylo? you get these great characters that need layering so the audience cares but no. i get a 40 minute trip to a shitty planet about horses that need to get freed and rich people gambling. jesus H christ it is almost unbelievable how horrendous this movie is. only good things are the music and visual effects which is a given because its StarWARs. in summation this movie was a total let down and crazy as it sounds it has killed a massive part of fandom inside me. like who gives a shit about episode 9? (or future spinoffs if this is where the starwars universe is headed) there weren't even any cliffhangers? Isn't that what good sequels do? <br><br>PS--Disney please leave that sjw nonsense out of starwars.

 Finally saw it after managing to avoid too many spoilers for over a week. I love all the Star Wars movies despite having complaints about all of them.

I especially was worried when I found the first full trailer to be meh. <br>I found the movie very satisfying. I was wide-eyed and engaged every second. The main thing and this is what I felt was missing from the Force Awakens--despite that TFA was fun and did a good job of establishing new characters and restarting a worthy new trilogy--was that I felt I could just relax into being taken for a ride by good storytelling. It felt like it mattered and had weight to it not like we were just playing Star Wars. That feeling of fan-fiction that I had with TFA was gone and I cared about what everybody was doing and why. <br>Everything with Luke Rey and Snoke especially were very satisfying but maybe not so much with Finn Rose DJ and Phasma. I like all of those characters but their stuff seems a little sloppy. Also this movie doesn't especially create suspense for excitement for the next movie only the potential for future stories in general., 4.0,  Rob P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/948367039/, March 10 2018, N/A

 This film is a disappointment. <br>- It hurts to see how Disney put political subplots in this film by force f.e. feminism or Chewbacca and the vegetarian incentive scene <br>- This film lacks of story writing as Ep. 7. F.e.: The casino scenario was an unnecesary filler and the spaceship hunting worth for a 30 minutes episode.<br>- The caracters did not make any developments/tiny sidesteps or grew. F.e. Rey is still a Mary Sue<br>- The film's logic is aweful. F.e. Luke Skywalker is probably THE most iconic hero in the film history and his backward thinking and his death were caused cheaply Snoke is still unknown and his dead has no big impacts because there was never a history to him Leia making the Superman-Move<br>- Disney destroys loved characters cheaply and replaces them with unpersonal ones: f.e. Admiral Ackbar's Death. He would have earned the ship's destroying move and not Captain Purple Unknown.<br>One last sad thing: Now there are qualified Regisseurs and politicians but no good story tellers. George Lucas handed out a possible script which was apparently not given much credit. The EU had so much good output! Timothy Zahn with Mara Jade! Jaina Solo! and Thrawn! The Yuuzhan War Conflict had been a very good Triology f.e.. So much development on this franchise grabbed in the next garbage tin. In contrast people gets popcorn cinema which is worth 1 look but not for more. This franchise is dead.<br><br>Only 3 things are positive at this film: John Williams epic music Mark Hamill's performance and luckily no 5th Death Star. I see that thing saved for Episode 9 directed by Jar Jahr Just-do-it-Again Abrams., 0.5,  Chris M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977073640/, March 10 2018, N/A

 Star Wars is dead to me.... this is such a slap in the face of all the story lines set up by JJ and characters built over 40 years....a Star Wars with no light saber battle? Killing off the bad guy with no story? What they did to Luke is indescribable we wait 40 years and you give us this BS story Luke was never coward but that what you make of him? You could have sent him off dying in an epic duel with Kylo. Screw you Rian and Disney....Lea floating through space? Wow just wow....oh now you can weaponize a space craft and sucide? Why didn't they just do that to all the Death Stars before it? Duh...you can't just add something so crazy 8 films in. What a shame... this should have been epic.

 In 3 days The Last Jedi will be released on DVD and BluRay. I expect Disney's damage control shills to inundate Rottentomatoes and the other critics sites with tons of fake reviews stating that this movie is the best Star Wars ever and inviting everybody to buy the DVDs and BluRay.<br>Just the way they lured the fans with cleverly misleading trailers and carefully leaked news like when Kathleen Kennedy said that Luke Skywalker would have been very important in TLJ... everybody knows what they did to our beloved Luke.<br>If you are reading the audience critics in order to decide whether or not to buy the DVD please take a look at the thousands of extremely negative reviews coming from people who have NOTHING TO GAIN by praising a disgrace of a movie and NOTHING TO LOSE by crashing it. <br>52% of the moviegoers who watched The Last Jedi have said they do not like it. They took the time to tell you why with page-long reviews.<br>The reviews which make the other 48% are one-liners with generic phrases like "Best Star Wars ever! Wow!" and 5 stars.<br>Moreover the bulk of the positive reviews has been posted in the first days of the screening in the theaters and guess what? They were ALL paid advertisements from people who live with what Disney gives them.<br>Who do you believe?<br>Please don't buy anything related to Disney's Star Wars. They have to understand that making a good movie come first and social justice and feminazism should not have anything to do with Star Wars.<br>The toys are already rotting on the shelves.

 As a star wars fan I just can't make my mind up about this film.

 *spoiler warning*this movie was an interesting roller coaster with ups and down but i must say it just didn't deliver might i add the movie hyped Luke Skywalker but he did nothing in the end it seems he was nothing but a distraction this is one of the many reasons why i believe this movies was a complete miss. Some reason i did not like this film<br>1 New characters from nowhere with bland personalities <br>2 rey became a powerful jedi without any training and beat someone who has trained for almost their entire life (Kylo ren) <br>3 Leia saves her self by using the force and everybody loses their crap but when rey with no training lifts up a mountain of boulders then it's whatever.ridiculous.<br><br>I rate this movie 2 alpacas out of 10whats up with rey and kylo ren., 0.5,  Don P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977156686/, March 10 2018, N/A

 Before I saw this i thought disney was concerned about quality control with the star wars franchise but that apparently is not the case. star wars was the original template for the summer action movie and this one is so boring that i only sat through it because of the legacy of the series. this movie steps on that legacy and treats it with a complete lack of respect. a 2-hour FU to the fans., 0.5,  james h, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977156516/, March 9 2018, N/A
 aFTER the disappointment of the force awakens i was surprised at how much i enjoyed the last jedi. the story went in directions that i didn't expect and i found that refreshing. it made me question what i thought i knew about the force and the jedi and about the destinies of my favorite characters. I want these movies to keep surprising me and challenging my ideas about how things should go. I know that this is not the popular opinion and that it's been a bridge too far for many fans but i was pleased with this movie. i look forward to seeing where the story goes from here. two thumbs way up!, 5.0,  Robert G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/919833821/, March 9 2018, N/A

 Too fake. Too many run-ons. Not enough action from Luke. Leia in space wtf? She should of just died there. Snoke died too easy and should have been killed by Luke. The pilot Poe Dameron was such a bad actor with stupid lines and way too sarcastic about everything including I Love you BB8. The mission to rich island was a waste of time and saving the weird horses was the dumbest scene of the movie. Luke never even explained the dark side to Rey or even warned her of the power of the dark-side. BB8 was completely farfetched at least five times in the movie including how he some how got on top of the fighter.

 JJ Abrams' Episode VII lazily imitated the tropes of the original Star Wars trilogy while ignoring the conclusion of Return of the Jedi.

 I was expecting this movie to be great but I was greatly disappointed for the following reasons:<br><br>1. Bad uses of the force- Leia someone who never wielded a lighsaber could survive space? Rey being able to beat Luke within days/weeks of training?<br><br>2. Snokes death- supposedly he could trick and interpersonally connect ppl together but couldn't see (with the same minds he controlled) that Kylo Ren would kill him?<br><br>3. Rehashed Plot--last battle was a bad version of the battle of hoth.<br><br>4. Half the movie was a slow space chase...really? Why wouldn't the first order not catch one lone ship that couldn't hyperspace?<br><br>5. RICH PPL ARE evil SPACE PETA 3rd wave feminism (Confirmed by the writers who on twitter and kathleen kennedy who explicitly said this was the purpose) more could go on but this was the worst star wars movie I have ever seen.<br><br>I will still be eager to see 9 and other Star Wars flicks from Disney maybe but this seriously killed my faith in Disney star wars.<br><br>I.E This is coming from someone who loved Leia as a character.

 Probably the best looking star wars to date but the poor writing and continuity within the star wars universe make it stand out as something different then even its its lead up movie. It mishandles many story arcs as if it forgets that it is a second part of a trilogy leaving few interesting plot hooks to its successor. Mark Hamill gave an amazing performance despite the film destroying the franchises most iconic hero while propping a Mary Sue (Gary Stu if you will) to replace him. Character development is exchanged for CGI and a B plot that's rendered pointless near its conclusion. It has many situations that are taken from Empire Strikes back and Return of the Jedi leaving Last Jedi look like a copy that doesn't understand the essence of the source material. Sadly Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill's last performance together is darkened by this films poor direction. As a fan from childhood and as a collector with a couple bookcases of books movies and various forms of memorabilia feel like this movie hurts my overall star wars experience and will not be adding it to my collection., 1.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977150035/, March 6 2018, N/A

 What a mess! <br>That was my initial reaction at the end of this movie. Before watching it I read some reviews by critics that said it was the best Star Was ever and that the story was very original. I cannot believe that they saw the same movie I did. The story was a bad mix of Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi not original at all in my opinion. And in my personal ranking of Star Wars films this one ends up even lower than the Ewok Adventure.<br>Why is it a mess? Because of very poor story development: the First Order are all idiots and the Rebels deserve a Darwin award for poor leadership bad communication stepping away from trusting a small group of people with an important life saving mission and choosing to fly into a death trap. There are no real villains left: Snoke was killed super easy by Kylo without ever being a threat to anyone Kylo doesn't develop beyond the tantrum baby that wants to rule the galaxy chokes at killing his mother gets his ass kicked by a completely untrained Rey all the time and becomes less and less threatening in every scene. Almost all of the built up questions from the Force Awakens were "answered": What about Snoke? Oh he's dead. What about Rey's parents and last name? They were deadbeats and no one cares. What about Luke? He became a disgusting sour old man gets no redemption and then just when he starts to get back on track dies for no reason. What about the incredible powers Rey has without any training? Oh that's normal see even some random kid can wield the force without training. The fact that they didn't solve the issue with Carrie Fishers death when they could have easily done so as Leia's role in this movie was fairly insignificant and there was a perfect opportunity in the story only adds to the feeling that this is a mess. <br>Two stars remain out of the standard 5 stars that a Star Wars movie would get from me for the visual spectacle and the fact that I do like the new cast. Too bad they are forced to act out such a poor story.<br>For the first time ever I am not looking forward to the next Star Wars movie as I cannot see an acceptable way forward Kill Leia off in the opening crawl? Recast? CGI? No good options there. Rey's power for no reason situation has come too far to be fixed and in the conclusion of a trilogy the rewards of character growth should be reaped so there is no time to realign the character with the power if such a thing is even possible. Kylo is a very weak main villain and also not ready for the end stage of a trilogy in my opinion. But most of all I guess I just do not trust the people that are currently making this new trilogy. The Force awakens was A New Hope for me not only in the sense that it played copycat on that movie but also because the Star Wars feeling was back and the old cast was handing over to an exiting new cast with a lot of potential. Sure there were some problems with the story that left some questions needing answers but I believed that was all fixable and I liked it. The last Jedi did not fix any of the problems but rather doubled down on them and created plenty more while not moving the story forward at all (apart from lots of characters dying nothing really happens). And now J.J. who is not known for bringing things to a satisfactory conclusion and who created some of the unaddressed issues in the first place needs to bring this to a conclusion he cannot copycat his way out of......<br>In my opinion Disney should postpone the next chapter in the trilogy get some better writers on board re-shoot and re-edit The Last Jedi to a movie that makes sense and re-release it before continuing with the saga. I promise I would go and watch it and I would forget this ever happened., 2.0,  Farth D, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977150277/, March 6 2018, N/A

 ****NOTE HAVE TO CHANGE 1/2 TO 1 STAR IN ORDER TO BE COUNTED IN REVIEW****<br><br>Saw this movie with old friends who came to town. Some parts of the movie are good but as many reviewers point out the plot is swiss cheese and full of holes. Another aspect is the political SJW propoganda that just gets hammered over your head for an hour and a half.<br><br>I'll break down the plot holes first ***spoiler allert***<br><br>Right from the beginning we have Poe setting up their bomb squad to "drop" bombs onto the star ships. Only one problem: nothing "drops" in deep space. After that the movie turns into a 2 hour long movie of a high speed car chase except in star wars form. With the rebels trying to make an escape Leia gets knocked out in an explosion but somehow uses the force in space to "mary poppins" her way back into the ship I guess she was trained in the force but never became a Jedi. Rest in peace Carrie Fisher but she seemed weak in her acting role: slurring words looking weak. I just find it hard to believe someone having a slurred speech can handle surviving empty space a huge explosion and then use the force because they are so "strong" to come back in. Then there is the time frame. Did the movie occur over 12 hours 2 days a week? It is very hard to tell because there are no stars or planets to relate how long this car chase is taking. This is a key issue because at one point Fin tries to make an escape knowing that the management taking over for Leia is going to get everyone killed. As he tries to leave this asian maintenance woman figures out his plan and tases him. Then she has a change of thought and they go on this secret mission. So here is where the timing is crucial. These two are in an escape pod and they somehow travel to this far away casino place go through their own ordeal get captured escape then travel back to the ship that is trying to run away from the first order. IF they were able to run away in an escape pod at what seems at light speed as well then why the heck was the rest of the rebel ship not able to do similar? How long were they on this secret mission? 12 hours? A day? Again it is very hard to tell. The big bad sith lorde's death is insanely anticlimactic for a super villian we just barely got to see not in a hologram projection. Finally to top it off almost all of the men had no real input into the plot development and were sidelined. Or they were just villains. Might as well not have had them in the movie. Even the asian maintenance lady somehow becomes an experienced pilot for some old school machines And Rey masters jedi abilities in basically what seems like a day or two of being around Luke where he did not even train her much. I'll end it on this how old is chewbacca? He has to be like 70 years old but looks the exact same. I have no idea why they have him there he feels distant with no real back and forth between other characters besides the little pigeons he became friends with.<br><br>Now onto the feminist SJW propoganda. ALL of the leadership roles are women. Literally a purple haired (insert feminist here) was a general and told Poe to stand down because Leia had demoted him. So what is her plan because there must be something under all that purple hair and 110 lbs of pure feminist power?... AAAaaaand... wait for it... Nothing for the entirety of the chase they have no plan but to wait it out as the last remaining ships run out of fuel and consequently get blown up. I am fine with strong women roles but literally every male character was just sidelined belittled and consequently irrelevant to the over all story and plot. As I point out Fin and that girl had escaped on a pod and came back so that was a viable answer to at least get a majority of forces escaped. Instead this "General" waits until the last minute then sends the escape vessels down to a planet in an obvious move and gets half of the remaining forces blown up. It is at this point that she finally decides to reverse the ship and travel light speed into the First Order. So after the entire fleet is blown up and they finally abandon ship and half of those people are blown up she makes the "brave" decision to kamakaze into them at the last minute. Back on Chewbacca another feminist SJW political point: eating meat is bad. Chewbacca basically gets shamed by these little creatures he is about to eat. So he feels bad and becomes friends with them. Two more things: as Fin tries to sacrifice himself to take out the death star cannon he gets smacked out of the way by that maintenance lady who says we will beat them with "love not hate" and proceeds to kiss him. The thing here is usually the man goes in for a kiss and so this is a socionorm that is trying to say to the audience "hey look women can be strong and make the first move" but the reality is that this girl is not very attractive and you could tell Fin did not want it and that the actor could not even portray that it was an organic moment. It seemed awkward as they lay infront of walkers and huge ships litteraly a few hundred yards away I think to myself "why are they not getting blasted out of the ground? " The last note is that Rey's abilities are wildly inaccurate. Some moments she seems at par with Kylo Ren in terms of the Force and then other times she does not even know how to move a couple of rocks. Every other character who used the force had to train for YEARS and YEARS. Annekin Yoda Luke even SAMUEL JACKSON!!! But i guess if you are Leia or Rey and you are a woman you don't have to master anything and you just learn it in like two days.<br><br>Episode 7 was ok and had some problems but at least there was character development and decent plot. This one was so all over the place that you have to be a die hard SW fan to ignore the complete flaws and obvious propaganda. This installment episode 8 literally made not want to watch the next one until it comes out for free on the internet. Utter garbage. You look at the audience reviews and none of the starwars installments have gotten this low. So now that Han is dead Luke is dead and Leia will have a limmited performance cuz shes dead in real life all we are left with is Rey and Kylo in what will most likely be the "ultimate stand off". Many of the exciting things we were looking to have happen were just utterly taken out from under the fan base: the sith lord's abilities and crazy fight (nope killed him off anticlimacticly) Luke having an epic fight? (nope just pretends to fight as a distraction and then dies even though he is not there).

 I really liked this. I can see the problems that others may point out but most of those are small to none.

 A movie that gets lots in its own convoluted plot misused characters and main protagonist who can do anything and everything with little to no explanation. This is Star Wars on steroids and not in a good way but rather in a "what have they done to themselves" type of way. Lots of questions from Episode 7 were cut off or deemed as unimportant in the story line reducing my interest in the future movies. The last issue I had with this new trilogy of saga movies is that they aren't self contained stories that play into a larger whole such as the rest of the movies but a single disjointed story that seems to be cut in the most awkward places to form a trilogy., 0.5,  Karl J, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/951525135/, March 8 2018, N/A

 Fool me once shame on you.<br><br>I saw the movie when it came and I'm still feeling disturbance in force. As long diehard Star Wars fan (I was born long before the New hope) my soul is torn apart in feelings about the new film.<br><br>I actually liked the ep 7 and though that this one is going to maintain the well set plotlines. No change. Instead this one feels more like standalone Star Wars film that has actually very little to do with SW lore or traditions or even good story telling.<br><br>The start scroll gave me good vibes as always and I was ready to see great start. Then I see one X-wing pilot that gives my-phone-is-breaking-up humor. Instead of shooting him the Imperials (The first order) let the pilot came closer and charge up afterburner. Why!?! I'm not asking why the Imperials are doing it as they are just actors with prewritten scripts. I'm asking why to ruin creditability of the whole bunch. Are the Imperials led by a laser brain? I want to fear them not to have a laugh. Wader would have beheaded the whole bunch. I miss him.<br><br>After one-man-beats-all show (why not anyone shut him down just for change) there are these suicide bombers. This is not the World War II film. I can't figure out any harder way to deliver the bombs. Have anyone heard of missiles? They are having a lot of robots but why humans are sacrificing themselves for nothing?<br><br>As film finally goes to see Luke I stunned by his response to the offered lightsaber. He throws it away. No creditability there either. Luckily the Yoda comes to give him some speech (the best part of the film) and Luke saves the day by ultimate sacrifice at the end.<br><br>The biggest plot hole of the movie that I can find is the chase. I wish Wader would have beheaded general Hux and ordered the fleet to jump close to the rebels. Problem solved. No Hux wants to have a joyride. He thinks that rebels are not smart enough to think any escape plan. And if they happen to have one someone is going to tell it to him (someone please shoot the Poe down).<br><br>To save the day (for Imperials) this Poe sends two sidekicks to a casino planet looking for a hacker. What a waste of film (or memory as the camera is digital I think). Why to write such a journey that achieve nothing positive? Finally Poe kills most of the rebels by revealing the plans to the unreliable hacker. Well done.<br><br>Meanwhile Kylo Ren kills SL Snoke and reveals that Reys parents sold her for some money. What a waste of good plot lines!<br><br>As movie goes on we get to the battle of Hoth duplication. Salt really? In my mind I can see salt fairies that spread salt (or how else there would be thin layer of salt everywhere). I can understand snow but no even layer of salt everywhere on red sand. As battle comes no changes no none shots Poe down (and no missiles or robots). But when Finn finally wants to do something right Rose stops him.<br><br>Finally all rebels left are put into the Millennium Falcon. Are all the others dead? I didn't see it.<br><br>And then the end. What a crash landing. I hated the boy when I first saw him. Now I hate him even more (I have nothing against the actor just the role). I'm feeling that we are going to see the stable Jedi wannabe even more., 1.0,  Orvo L, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977153406/, March 8 2018, N/A

 As mindless entertainment it's a typical "Summer blockbuster" type movie with plenty of action..which is fine.. as a Star Wars movie that is supposed to be part of a trilogy however it is a disappointing and downright disrespectful embarrassment to the franchise let alone the main storyline. As a lifelong SW fan I'm all for moving forward with the SW universe (the more movies the better imo) but if you're going to "kill the past" at least do it in a way that 1)actually makes sense 2)at least remotely pays homage to 40 years of SW knowledge (i.e. actually having to train and learn to use the force how "space" works etc) and 3) is somewhat respectful to the iconic characters the franchise was built upon. <br><br>There are so many issues with the film overall most of which are correctly pointed out in other people's post but the main issue is that the interesting storylines from TFA (and the other 6 SW movies apparently) were either purposely abandoned neglectfully ignored or lazily tied off in the most anticlimactic ways. Plus honestly the characters are downright uninteresting in this movie and the ones that are left have no interesting storylines to look forward to...For example Everything interesting about Rey's character from TFA has been abandoned because apparently she is THE MOST POWERFUL "Jedi" EVER AND NEEDS ABSOLUTELY ZERO TRAINING OR TEACHING. And Rian Johnson just basically SPITS on the LUKE SKYWALKER'S character as if he has always hated him (or as if he doesn't know anything about him at all).. There is absolutely no interesting story to look forward to in Episode IX...Rey vs Ren...again?? Poe flying a spaceship??? Finn doing some meaningless side mission to keep him busy??? Rian Johnson's SW installment shuns character development and interesting storylines for forced overreaching plot twists and unnecessarily misplaced jokes (as opposed to charming humor)..This movie feels more like a cheap Guardians of the Galaxy knockoff than a Star Wars movie complete with end credits and all.. JJ Abrams has his work cut out for him to save this "trilogy".. I for one have zero interest in seeing what will happen next which is something I never thought I would say.., wts,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977150045/, March 5 2018, N/A
 I get the director's desire to try to go with an "out with the old and in with the new" message but he didn't have to do it in the worst way possible. Mark Hamill deserves better. In fact all of the actors and actresses in the film deserved better. This movie had so much potential built up from the previous and they took the laziest route in order to try to further interest. Poor tone several continuity and it's one thing to ignore fans in order to do what you think is best and it's another different thing when you disregard any sort of feeling fans would hold., 0.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977149977/, March 5 2018, N/A
 Kathleen Kennedy revenge porn.<br>Rian Johnson is the Lee Harvey Oswald of the 21st century nothing more than a patsy. It's like Kennedy walked into the local hipster cafe and asked the guy with the biggest scarf and foamiest latte if he wants to write and direct a SW film. By bringing on said gimp she could then wield Power over this film pushing her agenda and exacting revenge for all the times men didn't listen to or even deigned to question her militant feminist ideas.<br> As usual men have an issue because she's a woman with power or the male ego or perhaps she didn't get a big enough raise or someone wolf-whistled at her fourteen years ago or whatever first-world champagne liberal issue it is this week. Of course it isn't because her ideas and film-making abilities are terrible it's all down to men and their nefarious ways as is portrayed throughout this insipid movie.<br>The only people who rate this movie higher than one star are idiots like my brother who just like to annoy people by playing devil's advocate throughout their entire lives what a joy these types are.<br>This is just another movie (like recent Bond and Trek) that sells-out in order to appeal to as many demographics as possible and only manages to appeal to the moronic Snapchat crowd for a half hour.<br>You can hear the conversation "well the fans will go regardless but how do we get everyone to go? Then we can buy two yachts with the profits".<br>What they fail to understand is that it's the fans who will see the film eight times who will buy four versions of the same blu ray who will buy the toys and video games and who will gladly line up to do it all again the next time.<br>It's business 101 make a quality product and people will return produce a piece of crap like this film and sure you may get us once but not twice.<br>It feels like every script now goes through the HR department prior to being approved ensuring that everyone feels catered to and the tone and themes are safe enough.<br>There's zero doubt Women can carry a film in this and any genre TFA rogue one even a franchise alien terminator Hunger G so the argument that having a powerful female lead is an issue with us guys is dead in the water but it must be said Daisy Ridley is the Tom cruise of females in Hollywood look at me everyone! I'm acting! Look how intense and focused I can be!! Could she at least try a different emotion?<br>I didn't notice how bad the performances were until Benecio appeared made them all look like amateurs although I suspect the one-dimensional performances are probably explained by the fact that you wouldn't let Johnson direct traffic on a one-way street in rural Montana in winter.<br>Someone tell Adam Driver that no amount of time in the gym or ridiculous scarring will ever make him any more intimidating than Wicket the Ewok I want my Sith Lord to be destroying planets and banging porn stars (sorry trump fans) not crying and facetiming plus this guy got his break playing a character that was in a sexual relationship with Lena Dunham and that's just unacceptable.<br>How did our hero Finn (who of course is no longer a hero in this film he's a deserter and a coward) have such a bland and preposterously unattractive love interest? I looked that woman up she's quite sexy but of course they dress her up in a sack and make her look like Rosie O'Donnell because women shouldn't be required to aspire/confirm to the male idea of what is beautiful and you don't have to be beautiful to get the hero and that regardless of what we see on the outside we are all equal and looks don't matter blah blah blah.<br>I'm on board love everyone give everyone a chance don't judge a book I totally agree things like racism abuse of power and sexual assault make me sick but for the love of our gender-less mixed-race questioning god I find it quite insulting when you wrap a tofu patty in a lettuce leaf coat it in dairy-free cheese and tell me it's a hamburger and then try to shove it down my throat at every single opportunity.<br>The above is not even the worst part not even close. This entire film was just Lazy sloppy disrespectful cartoonish (those pathetic jokes) and something that even the pedestrian prequels didn't achieve extremely boring as boring as the Winter Olympics - seriously rich kids skiing down a hill or prancing around on ice? Go away.<br>The final straw for me is that Chewbacca arguably the greatest sidekick in film history a true legend of the SW universe only functions as a chauffeur for Rey and is possibly a vegan! Paleo yes but a vegan? That's where I draw the line. Is there no end to this nightmare? This and Johnson turning Luke into an effeminate Prius driving self-portrait which is just the epitome of arrogance and self-indulgence. Luke was never John MacLaine but I had to check if I was actually watching 'The Notebook' for a minute there.<br>I'm not hurt by the killing of the sacred cow/s of the previous films sure go ahead kill it share it with everyone make shoes out of it start afresh take it in another direction but please at least respect the cow pay homage to it get a priest to bless it make it kosher halal have native elders perform a ceremony whatever makes you comfortable don't just throw it in the trash like it never mattered like it never gave you anything like it doesn't deserve even a burial ceremony who do you think you are?<br><br>Ok Star Wars died today it's a sad time but it's just a film the real conspiracy here is the wide-ranging manipulation of the masses by companies like Disney. This is not a good film in any sense fan or not it's not even worth 2 stars it just isn't how is the critic score in the 90th percentile? That's the legacy of this film the film itself should be thrown in the trash it no longer exists in my world but what is painfully obvious is Disney and other companies influencing what the public see as 'impartial' or 'unbiased' public forums or services just so they can make more money but I guess that's all that matters now., 1.0,  Adz%20 S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977140427/, March 5 2018, N/A

 I was so incredibly disappointed in this movie. I love Star Wars I consider myself a huge fan. With that said to be frank I am absolutely furious with Lucas Films for producing this movie. This film has destroyed continuity in Star Wars. I understand that plenty of people are trying to point out how this film VERY subtly sets up episode 9 in which we will learn everything we have wanted to know since episode 7. This is entirely my opinion but the Last Jedi developed so little that episode 9 is tragically doomed. episode 9 will have to be 5 hours long in order to develop and explain everything we want to know why Rey is so powerful everything Snoke what's up with Po and Leia where is the rest of the Universe while there are new Death Stars and Dreadnaughts are being built etc.? I dont even care if anyone reads this. I've seen this movie twice and read loads of reviews and such. Nothing can convince me that this was one of the biggest series bombs in film history. in summation The Last Jedi is the most frustrating movies that I have ever seen., 1.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977149878/, March 5 2018, N/A

 The eighth chapter in the Skywalker saga is a corporate cash in of galactic proportions. From the over advertises children's toy Porgs to the "play it safe" Disney live-action over reliance on poorly timed gags. This film despite its disregard for the fans (a community which includes star Mark Hamil and who kept Star Wars alive for years) includes pointless sequences of ham fisted morality and needless complication to an already swollen plot. Any moments of grandeur are soon revealed to be delusion as Rian Jonsons paving over the past film sets a very bland middle of the road adventure for all the family. The entire film is saved by glimmers of gold in Hamil and Adam Driver's performances but on the whole the cheap references and disregard for the legacy make this putting feel poor and prove that Disney is truly only interested in the money., ,  Jack P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/922460179/, March 5 2018, N/A

 When I left the theater I was really on the fence about this film. It wasn't a bad film production quality was high but it left me with a burrs in my mind that took me some time to sort through.<br><br>There were some major story elements that were absurd. Suspension of disbelief for the sake of the story on occasion is one thing but when the film has so many obvious poorly thought out plot items it's hard to swallow.<br><br>There were also a number of physics violations or oversights. One or two of these would be fine but it definitely puts you in a poor frame of mind when one of them is at the very start of the film (bomb bay doors open to space where people are exposed also bombs falling down in space etc). There is a scene with Leia that not only requires major suspension of disbelief but a tremendous amount of personal effort in order to justify the event.<br><br>The humor felt wrong. It felt like the movie was trying for a Marvel style of humor which has never belonged to the Star Wars universe and is following a trend right now of films in general trying to be funnier. It might have worked had the jokes not been overdone but as it was it just felt out of place. Two examples come to mind immediately the first was the joke about the admiral on the bridge when Poe Dameron stalls for time. Funny initially but too drawn out. The same was true in the scene where Chewbacca cooks the Porg initially funny but when it drags on with the Porg making "Bambi eyes" the laughter bubbled off and stewed into exasperation.<br><br>*Spoilers follow.*<br><br>I took umbrage with the film's storytelling priorities. Too much time was spent on the casino thread for starters. I'm all in favor of stories having plot lines and plans that don't work out but this one felt terribly contrived. They leave their convoy go to a giant casino city to find the one guy in the universe who can do what they need then they get arrested for essentially a parking violation. Contrived. Then despite not being able to talk to Mr McGuffin they just happen to get thrown in a cell with some guy who can also do the thing that they need. Contrived. Then there is a preposterous scene where the crew frees the space horses and they race through the casino in order to dramatically escape.<br><br>They spent all that time on the storyline to find this person and comparatively little on the Jedi thread in which Luke and Rey interact. It started well enough we get a feeling of Luke as an old cynic we slowly start learning about some of the history an interesting foundation is established. However by the time Luke agrees to train her she has one real lesson and just sort of leaves. She has no training she barely spent any time with Luke and yet the end of the film implies that she's a Jedi. Of course I'm oversimplifying but I found it terribly obnoxious.<br><br>All this time was spent on an absurd story about a casino city which felt like it existed just because they wanted to have something for those characters to do and the trade-off was that we get to see less of Luke and Rey nothing of the history of Snoke and Kylo Ren besides a mere mention and very little extrapolation on the whole "last Jedi" motif.<br><br>One story point that I found to be excellent was the elimination of Snoke towards the end of the film. It happened in a fairly predictable manner but it was a surprising happening in this film and not the third film. The whole throne-room scene was well done and very fitting. I wish more of the film had been like that.<br><br>The other story point that must be discussed is the final most important detail. Going into the film it felt like Luke Skywalker's death was inevitable generally speaking it's a bad thing for a film when a character's fate feels pre-determined unless the filmmakers can upset or surpass expectations. The setup was right it had a very "Ben Kenobi" feel to it and in the end we learn that Luke wasn't there at all he had simply been projecting himself through meditation and communion with the Force. It was wonderfully surprising a brilliant way to present Luke's stand and escape what had seemed to be inevitable. But wait... Luke just disappeared out from under his cloak like Yoda under the blankets he's gone. They took that stroke of brilliance and just threw it away dropping right back into the rut of inevitability.<br><br>*Spoilers end.*<br><br>It wasn't all bad.<br><br>There were layers of conflict - internal and external conflict conflicting roles conflicts of interest - woven among many different characters. This turned out pretty well even if some of the methods of portrayal and the resolutions offered felt unsatisfactory. Some of the conflicts and self-doubt and questioning felt as though they were written for children - and perhaps they were - so they left something to be desired on a more profound philosophical level. It would have been very intriguing had the story addressed more of the history of Snoke Kylo Ren and Skywalker there was a perfect setup for addressing some of those motifs with Rey as well. However as it was the story just felt like it skimmed the surface instead of plumbing the depths and came across as banal and trite as a result instead of sharp and insightful.<br><br>The production and technical aspects of the film were tremendous. It felt pretty cleared that production spared no expense in putting the film together. It was a very pretty film and in that regard it was a pleasure to behold. Particularly in the initial space battle the action felt like Star Wars and was well-constructed and immersive (at least until the whole bomb bay doors/kicking the ladder thing). The production of the film cannot be gainsaid.<br><br>The acting performances were on a whole superior to the prior film. Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver in particular stood out as improved performances. Mark Hamill was terrific. All of the actors seemed to feel their characters well and with the exception of Benecio Del Toro - nothing wrong with his performance but the role itself felt type-cast and cliche - the characters felt fairly authentic. It should also be mentioned that Laura Dern played perhaps the most understated character in the film and was excellent despite the relatively little screen time and late introduction.<br><br>This analysis could go on into great detail ad nauseum but there are enough other reviews out there picking at details that it's simply unnecessary. Suffice it to say that this film - while technically sound and reasonably well-acted - was off in terms of story and flavor and was unfortunately a disappointment once the dust settled and the experience had soaked in and been thoroughly processed., 3.0,  Devon W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/941330657/, March 5 2018, N/A

 Is Star Wars worth saving anymore? If it is here's some possibilities. 1.Petition Disney to relent the films sell it or franchise it out to other production companies. 2. Persuade the big companies to buy it off Disney. Apple would be a good choice. 3. Make your own Star Wars movie If you can afford it or start a kickstarter campaign. <br>If the film is good enough but Disney tries to terminate the production of it sell the film to them.<br><br>The main problem with the last two films was they were rushed. I've a feeling they made quickly because Disney were worried at least one of the three older cast members would pass away and they had to justify getting they're money back quickly after spending 3 Billion. So Last Jedi has to follow up TFA because it has to it's a trilogy it's already following a film that was made in haste. So without even seeing Last Jedi i can tell that it's already fallen flat. I won't see it. i'm not their audience. What's dividing the fans is Disney doesn't want to scare anyone so the films will be as safe as possible and have plenty of political correctness sellotaped on to it., 0.5,  Richard P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/941397248/, March 5 2018, N/A
 "Star Wars: The Last Jedi" gets 4 1/2 out of 5 stars! This movie wasn't perfect but it was really good! The first 10 or so minutes was a little too goofy but luckily it mostly pivoted away from that quickly. There was also a segment in it that should have been cut as it served no purpose to the story. There are a couple other minor things I would have changed but the over-arching story is original and creative and didn't borrow from old movies in the franchise which was a good thing. I understand a bit of the criticism but the overarching story is very original and cool and other than a few things I thought it was very good. It could have been slightly better executed but overall the story was what made it so good. Despite The Force Awakens lack of originality it was better executed than this although that's not to say this was poorly executed just not as well as Force Awakens. The story itself was very compelling though and was fresh and exciting and that still propels this to my #3 favorite Star Wars behind Empire Strikes Back and RETURN of the Jedi., 4.5,  Dan M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/781789258/, March 7 2018, N/A

 As a life long fan i was beyond excited for rian johnson's take on SW. i can see now that my faith in him was misplaced. i understand every reason why top critics liked this movie while audiences and especially sw fans do not. i for one hated it the first viewing. i hoped maybe i missed the point or something went wrong with my brain on that first viewing. it was only worse the second time. it is an okay average movie... yet a terrible star wars movie. how rian as a life long sw fan could not understand what to do and what kind of story to tell is still impossible to believe. as someone who watches the films (even the prequels) often i can honestly say i will never see this movie again. and I consider it the worst of any star wars movie ever made., 0.5,  Vincent D, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977150971/, March 7 2018, N/A
 NO SPOILERS. Shouldn't have listened to all the hype (and critic's reviews) as this created unrealistic expectations. Was certainly good but expected much much more. Some surprises were great others too obvious or not designed/divulged very well so lost punch or impact intended (that could have easily been achieved). Jokes - some funny subtle and well timed while others far too forced/corny - seemed too much an attempt to duplicate those created almost effortlessly by JJ Abrams. Also some characters were seemingly fit into story without any need or value simply for air time. Similarly some of the "drama" was overdone and pointless just for effect rather than meaningful or relevant storytelling. Can't wait for next installment to get back on track as left room for JJ to once again save the day and bring the story to close., 0.5,  Craig P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/972652783/, March 7 2018, N/A

 The last Jedi has many strange plot choices that take star wars in a bad direction in my OPINION. A few tweaks to some scenes would make the whole film much better but I just don't like the way LUKE is portrayed at all HE seems so cowardly and doesn't seem at all like the old luke we once knew and some OF the things he does make no sense at all the sub plot takes up way too much time that could HAVE been better used with Rey and luke rey just has force powers now without any notable training from luke she doesn't need any training because she is already a master of everything she learned how to fly fight with a light saber and use the force with absolutely no training at all whereas LUKE and Anakin all required years of training to master the same skills I was hoping rey would have to struggle and grow to become a better character in some way in this film but nope she really is worthy of being called a mary sue, 2.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977152155/, March 7 2018, N/A

 This film fails the second film in a TRILOGY to expand on what came before and provide a reason to be excited for the final act. Johnson gave RIDICULOUS amounts of screen time to characters we have no investment in. returning characters like finn do not SIGNIFICANTLY contribute to the plot. j.j abrams provided many potential plot points which were shut down in order to subvert expectations. The movie has many flaws but the most severe flaw is that there is no hook for the next film. there is no good villain and no IMMEDIATE task which must be addressed. The next movie could take place 2 minutes after the end of the last jedi or 20 years after the events of the last jedi. there is nothing to keep me invested in the story so i don't care what comes next., 1.0,  Chris C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/947936623/, March 6 2018, N/A

The problem is the last Jedi was confusing with it's lack of sense beginning to end with how the characters take action. How the main character is a mary sue by easily learning everything and SURPASSING her master to the point of being jaw dropping annoying good.

 After reading the "Top Critics" response I truly believe they are either paid off by movie companies or they are just pandering to what they believe the masses want to think. This movie was awful from beginning to end. It offered nothing in STORY from a star wars movie or Any other movie for that matter. It did not feel like it was set in the same "universe" as preceding movies and might just have been hyped as a reboot. The acting of all support characters made it feel cheap and From sets to script it offered nothing new. so wrapped up in politics and out of place jokes was it that it pushed you out of the world of star wars rather than pull you deeper in.

 Where do I start? The good? It's a Star Wars movie. The bad? Luke skywalker's character is wasted. Disney made a mockery of him. Really did I wait 30 years to see him milk a sea cow? Apparently I did. I like Rey. I really do! However she's gone from Luke as an orphan to Luke at the beginning of "Return of the Jedi" without any real training or trials. I wish I could grow in life as easily as Rey grows in these movies. Lastly -- and I'll say it -- The female characters are made stronger by chopping the male characters' legs off. The men are all idiots. Let me compare this to Star Trek: Voyager or Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: Those shows had *very* strong female characters while also having very strong male characters. However in Star Wars the male characters are little babies. Did I wait 30 years to see this? Yes I did., 1.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977151477/, March 6 2018, N/A

 I give this movie half a star not because it was a horrible movie but because Star Wars franchise has potential for so much more. This movie was funny and had some good scenes in it but the bigger part of it was full of plot holes disappointed expectations and a bunch of pointless scenes about social topics that have no place in Star Wars universe. (My personal problem: wasted opportunity for Admiral Ackbar.) Instead his role was taken by a pink haired lady that looks nothing like a military admiral.

 sad to say that this movie has a hard time even fighting for two stars. Kylo has some character development and everyone one else around him are empty shells with no character.

 Rian got this movie wrong. Im a great fan of the original three films and The Force Awakens was a superb reboot that i couldnt have enjoyed more. This movie left me feeling empty and disappointed. Lukes storyline couldnt have been worse. After decades of waiting we find out that our hero is a sulking failure who almost murdered his nephew in cold blood. Hopes of there being a last minute recovery never happened and Rian makes sure no-one can change it by killing Luke off. Rian casually discarded all the storylines from the last film. Rey can lift a ton of rocks without even trying and without training. Force ghosts can touch things. Bombs fall in space without gravity. We know nothing about Snoke but he's gone. Knight of Ren? What has happened to Poe Damerons character? My heart sank so many times watching this film.<br><br>I honestly don't know how Disney allowed this to happen. Surely someone at Disney who understands Star Wars was monitoring the story development? Personally I want to see an apology from Disney. Continuing to state that a minority are unhappy is ridiculous and insulting. Only then is there a chance that there is a future. Needless to say Rian Johnson wont make another Star Wars film that I'll watch., 1.0,  James A, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977105128/, March 5 2018, N/A
 It will come to be known as the worst movie ever made with a budget that large.

 This film ruined star wars. I'm hoping for a reboot. I gave it one star for the awesome music and visuals. However plot-wise it is a disaster. They have taken those you look up to in star wars and made their characters pathetic and flawed. They have ruined several heroes and replaced them with nothing worth getting excited about. There are a bunch of other issues but ruining luke skywalker is pretty much unforgivable. Star wars is dead - I don't see how they can fix it without a reboot. I don't know if I'll be able to enjoy the originals now without trying to play mind games to forget what I've seen in this one. You can tell the director was not a true fan or else he would have never done this. I'm also shocked at Kathleen kennedy. She should have known better.

 THIS movie is VERY decisive. <br><br>*UPDATE: In light of finding out that Rian Johnson Scrapped JJ's roadmap script for the sake of "Art" I guess there's a lot of reasons as to why this movie ended up being the way it is now....a messy movie. Thank Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson for the screwup!!! <br>This movie had a chance to be saved....<br><br><br>Regardless of how the Tomatometer says this movie is one of the few Star Wars movie next to the prequels that I can honest say is one of the most split down the center movie and to be honest I can see why from both sides. On one side Its very visually beautiful a very bold direction in the star wars mythos and of course Director Rian Johnson took A LOT of liberties to make this movie his baby. On the other side this movie is polarizing....so many plot holes certain characters get placed in the back-burner while other characters got...well the new term for it now is "SNOKED" (Sorry Bobba Fett you officially can retire now) its very convoluted and contrived and just when JJ Abrams give the next director the keys and plate of questions and mysteries...Mr. Johnson threw that to the side and just gave the proverbial F-U and did his thing. So yeah I get it and yet while I did enjoy this movie to a degree the overall experience left me not only scratching my head but....it rubbed me...and not in the right way. While the over arching theme of this movie is learning from failure and trying to make things right while also letting the past go and all that. That among other things didn't help deal with the too many players in the field aspect and having a director pull a Fire sale (Everything much go) come at the cost of a lot of movie goers scratching their heads at what the hell did they watch. <br><br>So with that said much like my "Justice League" i'm gonna to do a what I took away from watching Star Wars: The Last Jedi and beware for those that didn't see this movie SPOILERS AHEAD its not gonna be in order....you've been warned!<br><br>1) Sorry guys the whole Luke throwing the light saber over the shoulder scene left people in my theater silent cause it came off as WTF and FU to JJ Abrams work at the exact same time....and not in that order! <br><br>2) I will say that Adam Driver as Kylo Ren is a very complex Antagonist and I hope they do explore more about him in novels and maybe in Episode 9 but as of right now they need push his tantrums to the side for a bit. <br><br>3) Yes Rey isn't a 'Mary Sue' (to a degree) but lets be real....for someone who barely has any training can take on the Praetorian guards left me questioning some things...but it was an awesome fight indeed very brutal but on the same coin there's no way in hell you can best a Jedi master like Luke Skywalker when you have Zero training raw skills and barely a one up over a person who's has 30-yrs but apparently she has and it would seem wired that she has things given to her instead of earning it so one would think that she's too overly perfect which will make her pretty boring....In other words She has a lot things given to her for...reasons? and Rey as a character brings no stakes you don't feel anything for her cause there's no reason to cause you always know she will make it out of anything with no repercussions...Unlike her counterpart Luke who had lost arm found a dark version of himself Made mistakes time after time with a lot of repercussions for himself and his friends all of this evolved Luke....I don't see there's gonna be an evolution for Rey. You know what maybe she IS a Mary Sue!! <br><br>4) Which brings me to this....I think Kylo is lying about her parents being nobody...remember Kylo has a habit of telling half truths so its possible there's more to the story. But if that's the case its still cool nether-less but the way JJ set up that mystery surrounding her background and then have Rian scrub that away...again seems like the proverbial FU to TFA. <br><br>5) They REALLY did my boy Finn dirty in this. He was a prominent character in TFA and he had an interesting and mysterious backstory I get it in the novels he was the perfect storm-trooper and possible borderline have jedi capabilities....and in TFA there were a lot of question pertaining to how he broke free from the mindwipe and why he lied to Han about working in "Sanitation" as well as how did Kylo knew it was him that helped Poe and is he possibly force capable... but that's neither here nor there cause Rian threw that out the door. For one we don't know how long he was in stasis and if this movie is taken place AFTER TFA then unless that's a special type of Bacta flowing thru him he should not have walked out that suit in the beginning. But yeah I guess that doesn't matter cause....plot convenience!? <br><br>6) Make no mistake that first 15 min battle sequence was awesome. But lets be real here Poe's cockiness got A LOT of people killed and yes I did chuckle at the "I'll hold" moment!<br><br>7) And DAMN they did General Hux dirty in this movie didn't they!<br>8) Rose came off to me like a overacted cartoon character. She had no depth nor backstory other than her sister sacrificed herself. Which would have been fine to explore Rose as a person and touch on that later in the movie which would have resulted in a much more hard hitting and impacting scene for her as a character. But nope Rian had to make her a very over reaching person who seemed way too emotional but strangely she grew on me....is that wrong?<br><br>9) But that line she gave at the climax....DID NOT grow on me. people in my theater was like "REALLY!!?"<br><br>10) So....Leia is.....Supergirl now!? I get it she's a skywalker so the Force is with her but still.....THAT scene!! the way i see it this would have been a PERFECT send off for her the scene alone felt like Furious 7 until Leia pulled that moment and it just offset a finality to her that could have worked and hit hard with people. THANKS RIAN!!<br><br>11) Who the F*** is General Holdo (Aside being a creation of every SJW's wet dream) for a moment I really thought she was a plant from the first order. Then she wouldn't even tell Poe her plans...which if she did then Finn and Rose wouldn't have gone to Casino Royale for.....Reasons!?<br><br>12) About Canto Bight. Look despite what reviewers are talking about this moment making seem like it took up the ENTIRE movie It didn't...it was only like 3-4 scenes...where they necessary? not really it just seem like Rian had too much story and just didn't know what to do with Finn and this new character so he placed them in a place that was unnecessary. And yes it felt a bit Prequel-ish. which is why I still say they did Finn dirty in this movie!! <br><br>13) *sigh* I can see why Mark Hamill stated "This wasn't his Luke Skywalker"....i'm gonna leave it at that! <br><br>14) NO F**K That....are you kidding me Luke Skywalker had thoughts about killing his nephew!!? REALLY!!? LUKE (I see the good in my serial killing father) SKYWALKER!!? in that moment I was left wondering if that was accidentally placed in this movie for a reason? And the fact that people are defending this scares me!! <br><br>15) THAT lightspeed ram into the first order......EPIC! I can imagine someone like Admiral Adama (from BSG) doing something so epic like that...and without sound was perfect. But on the bad side.....General Holdo was a wasted new character once again Rian Johnson pulling a fire sale and not giving new characters room to grow. while the scene was awesome I felt nothing for the character cause I knew nothing about her. And that's the MAJOR problem it feels like he (Rian) Underused characters waist characters put other characters on the side lines or just completely kill them off without barely granting them a backstory which you would think its integral to the over-arch of the movie but nope not to screenplay writer Rian Johnson! <br><br>16) OMG Phasma....I mean like WTF. "Oh she will be very prominent in the last Jedi" says Kathleen Kennedy...I guess the lie detector proved that was a lie! What makes this a sad state is the fact that the novel based around her Character was awesome...but they wasted her character so hard it was pointless to even put her on screen...but the fight between Finn and her was great...again short and wasted. (See #15)<br><br>17) and WTF with Snoke....another wasted antagonist....i don't care what people say this was JJ Abrams creation and there was a mystery behind him...and Rian gave a FU in one particular scene and I get it if that didn't happen we wouldn't have gotten that cool fight but I argue we still could have had that Cool ass fight WITH SNOKE in it!! (See # 15 and 16)<br><br>18) While it was cool that Yoda made an appearance in puppet format and Frank Oz for the voice. I felt Obi-wan would have been a much impacting choice given that it was Obi-wan that took care of him and watched over him as a baby. It was Obi-wan's sacrifice that impacted Luke the most and given that in TFA it was his voice that showed up when Rey touched the lightsaber it would have been an emotional twist if he showed up to Luke instead of Yoda....and how Yoda get lighting powers anyhow to burn that tree?<br><br>19) BTW Rey's a thief for stealing the books that were suppose to burn...she did take them!<br><br>20) Yes the Porgs were cute..But you know what else was cute.....Chewbacca eating the Porgs....hahahahahahaha!!!<br><br>21) Krayt was awesome. The climatic battle was awesome...the Crystal Fox...awesome....but yes it did feel a bit too Empire strikes back Hoth style for me! so while everyone is praising the movie for being "Different" there are sprinkles of elements from "Empire Strikes Back" in this movie and I guess people were blind to not see that! <br><br>22) Finn was about to Go out like a G in that sacrifice but I'm glad that didn't happen but man......did i mention that line Rose gave him!? woof!!<br><br>23) and yes that line rose said contradicted EVERYTHING that happen in the final climax of Rouge One so...nice try!<br><br>24) WHERE THE F*** IS LANDO!!? <br><br>25) Yes the Final Fight between Kylo and Force hologram Luke was good...but you know what would have been awesome. A REAL Luke Skywalker actually showing up to fight Kylo...can you imagine Luke finally gives in and confront his past cause he feels he needs to fix the failure of himself and to give Kylo a chance to return to the Light with ever ounce of Force power he finally raises his X-wing from the waters of Eh-to ( think that's the spelling) and finally go to Krayt to face his past and find redemption. See? much better!<br><br>26) So I guess the Map to Luke in TFA was kinda pointless as well since he was only going to this planet to die..........even though in TFA it was set up (more like hyped up) that Luke was going to the edge of the galaxy to the first Jedi temple to find himself and understand what to do next....Once again Rian Johnson gave JJ the proverbial F-U and one to the fans of TFA. <br><br>Special: RIP General Ackbar...your off screen passing was another blunder on Rian's part!! <br><br><br>There's alot more but we are gonna leave it at that.<br><br>Overall:<br><br>This movie is a beautiful mess. Too many Characters and not enough focus while I Felt the battles were sweeping the way Rian uses silence in some scenes were great and some characters got more development than others but overall this film worked in some places and raised questions in others. New characters come and go with the quickness and a lot of questions are now raised but this movie feels like a finality rather than a continuation which begs the question what's in store for Episode 9 and can JJ fix the messes that Rian built?<br>But I can understand why this film is split and I get it. which is why I feel this movie is uneven for me. But I will see this movie again or get it on Blu-ray...after all I do have the entire star wars collection!, 3.0,  Chris W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/947529150/, March 6 2018, N/A

 I saw this movie 3 times so I could truly apply logic to it and not have it based on emotion. The cinematics were very good and the movie had it's very good points. Overall though it was so very disappointing how Disney has the golden goose of backstory and lore and decides not to tie in and connect to it. So much time was wasted on scenes that were completely irrelevant not only to the movie but the overall star wars universe. A film that had 3 hours of our attention yet didn't provide us with character background left us hanging with character storylines that don't make any sense. The storyline for every character in this movie was disappointing. Great characters were created and I like them all but their storyline and the overall writing and presentation of this movie was a huge let down. The cinematics were great but everything relating to the story was terrible. I liked Force Awakens and thought it provided a great base which this did nothing to build on. Disney CAN make a good star wars movie as i loved rogue one and liked The force awakens but the overall storyline character development was terrible and so much could have done with the screen time that was wasted on the casino scenes. Now with all the political comments Kennedy Johnson and Abrams are making it makes me dislike the movie that much more and makes me worry about the future. if you want to be political then run for political office you are paid to write direct and produce a good movie. How about you focus on that which is your job instead trying to create a political agenda and throw out terrible negative social accusations that don't even make sense., 2.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977150816/, March 6 2018, N/A

 It's difficult not to be reactionary with this movie.<br>There are so many layers to the concerns and I don't think they begin with this movie. The path that Kathleen Kennedy laid out with The Force Awakens (along with JJ Abrams) was disappointing. The first movie wasn't terrible but was a rehash of Episode 4. Rian Johnson took the helm and decided to take the saga in a completely new direction which to be honest utterly failed as it did not honor any of the storytelling that came before. <br>Heroes we grew up with were disgraced and destroyed. new politically correct characters were shoehorned in to give Disney and Kathleen Kennedy a sense of purpose. <br>The sad thing is that the story of Luke Skywalker ends on such a blah bland and futile note. He is a broken man (as was Han Solo) and both end their journey in the dust and dirt. There is no wonderful end to the Hero's Journey. Instead Rian Johnson just tosses them into oblivion so he can take the helm on his new saga. <br>The true theme of this movie is destroying the old so the new can take over. But not only does he destroy the old he crushes it under his foot and kicks it into the gutter. <br>By not liking this movie fans are told they are not 'smart' or 'Part of the Social Justice movement. That the male element of star wars is pathetic and as disgraced as han and luke. Kennedy even goes so far to tell people the force is female (another jab at male fans). <br>Star wars fans have taken a huge hit with the last two movies. Male fans are told we need to go away (Kennedy is quoted saying that she does not make the movies for male fans).<br>At the end of the day this is not a good star wars movie. It is a political statement and a dig at fans. <br>For the first time in my life i'm not interested in seeing or supporting any more star wars films or lucasfilm projects. I am not interested in supporting the merchandise. I am not interested in seeing how the current trilogy ends. <br>At the end of the day this movie tells me that Star wars once a huge part of my life is no longer relevant to me. <br>Sad it had to end this way.<br>Miss you George.

 I consider myself an average movie goer who also happened to grow up with star wars. I held off seeing this star wars because of all the fan reactions. I finally decided to see it for myself thinking it's star wars it can't be that bad. unfortunately it was far far worse than I could have ever imagined. without spoilers all I can say I am still reeling from what happened. on top of that I am now being told star wars doesn't need male fans.

 This is my first rotten tomatoes score ever. I am not a robot. I am fan of starwars. Have been one since I was a child. I hated this movie. They intriduced Disney mysticism to starwars and it doesn't work...... It's so bad..... really bad. Leia should have clicked her heels before force space walking. Lukes whole who gives a shit attitude towards the force and his family set the tone for how much you really shouldn't give a shit about this movie. I am real.... Not a bot.... I agree the movie was shot beautifully. But when all you shoot is a polished turd....... why do this to starwars???? If you wanted something new then go create your own space drama. Don't split fans of a franchise that's been around longer than a contract of ownership. The only thing missing at the end? You know the Disney commercial scene. Is a Hasbro logo.... This review is just the tip of the iceberg. I haven't gone into detail. Way to split a fan base who's only disagreements were dark side and light.

 This movie was an incoherent mess combined with lazy writing. The inability / refusal to develop Snoke as a character is ground zero for the disappointment. Snoke should have been a key cinematic legend and they simply jettisoned him for no other reason than they did not seem to want to develop him. Same thing with Poe Finn and they even simplified Rey by making her a nobody. This may be the only Star Wars movie that I don't buy a home version of., 1.0,  Juan B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/917440193/, March 4 2018, N/A

 Probably going to bounce all over the place in this review but some things need to be said. [SPOILERS AHEAD!!]<br><br>[MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!]<br><br>I literally created an account just to talk about this movie because as a life-long Star Wars fan this movie was just downright insulting to me.<br><br>First off ratings don't even count on this site unless it's a least 1 star. So for all the people trying to say it's the "bots" bringing the ratings down on this movie...no. Just no. If all of the reviews were counted the way they should be this movie would be so much lower than 48%. So if anything the rating for this movie is much higher than it should be if you look at all the 1/2 star reviews.<br><br>Now there's a lot of (liberal) political agenda going on in this movie. Some of it is subtle but most of it they don't even TRY to hide. Admiral Holdo...aka Admiral Gender Studies. Not much needs to be said there it mostly speaks for itself. The moment I saw her the FIRST thing I thought to myself was "she looks like she just got back from the women's march". At the very least she could've bothered to be in a military uniform being an admiral and all. I've never seen military personnel especially high-ranking ones in real life or in fiction who weren't wearing their uniforms WHILE they were on military duty. Not to mention all the capitalist hatred that Worse-Than-Jar-Jar Rose was spewing that had literally NOTHING to do with the movie. It's like the entire casino planet scene (worst part of the movie) served no purpose other than to push a political agenda. And for all the hatred of the rich and the mistreating the poor she decides she'd rather rescue a bunch of animals instead of saving the slave children. And I'm biracial so don't even try to throw the race card in my direction it won't work....but did anyone else notice how ALL of the good guys except Luke were either minorities women or aliens while ALL of the bad guys were white men except for Phasma a white female who might as well be a man? I highly doubt that was a coincidence. And no JJ we're not "threatened by women" just because we dislike a movie that isn't good. Most of us fans actually LOVED Rogue One. Main character? A WOMAN...an interesting one with real character development who wasn't a mary sue and who actually had a real place in the story. Jyn Erso is one of my absolute favorite characters in the saga. Don't try to blame the fans for you and Rian Johnson's failures.<br><br>I'm not saying this is the worst movie in the franchise but it comes close (this movie was one sand comment away from being as bad as Attack of the Clones) but it certainly had BY FAR the worst plot in the entire franchise. And I use the term "plot" loosely here. Literally the biggest part of the plot in this movie was the Resistance running away from the First Order while they run our of fuel. There are subplots like the casino planet (where's the Death Star when you need it) and Rey with her lack of training while trying to convince Luke to....be Luke. And going into Rey's parents a plotline that was MASSIVELY built up...just to be resolved in the most anti-climactic way ever. Like if Rey's parents were nobody that'd be fine. Don't spend a movie and half building up the anticipation just to slap every fan in the face. All of the subplots were terrible which is saying a lot when the main plot is the equivalent of a day-long intergalactic police chase.<br><br>And then Snoke. Another character who was built up in The Force Awakens....just to be killed by the most predictable Star Wars villain in the franchise in a way that makes Snoke look utterly pathetic. And we still don't know who the f- he is where he came from and most importantly why there's someone that powerful in the Force but who was completely unknown since the Clone Wars even though he's clearly old enough to have been around then. What's the deal with him? We'll never know because he didn't do anything in the movie...and then he was dead. For no reason. He ultimately brought nothing to the story...but then neither did this entire movie.<br><br>I get that most saber fights in the movies have their flaws but what the heck was with THIS fight?? One of the worst melee fights if not THE worst in the entire franchise. Barely any better than the original Kenobi vs. Vader fight. It was honestly cringeworthy and painful to watch.<br><br>And then there's Rey...how much more of a mary sue could she be?? This movie takes place over the course of 2 days at the MOST and it picks up right where TFA left off where Rey had just discovered maybe a day earlier that she could use the Force. So at the VERY VERY MOST she's known that she can use the Force for about 4 days. And in that time she's had basically no training and yet somehow she can lift tons of rocks probably a total of what weighed more than an X-Wing something that LUKE SKYWALKER who supposedly has the same amount of potential as THE CHOSEN ONE wasn't able to do by the end of Empire Strikes Back after having what a few months of training? Pretty sure even Anakin wasn't able to pull that off until he'd had at least a few weeks if not months of training.<br><br>And he certainly didn't fly through the vacuum of space like Leia. What is it with all of these massively powerful but almost completely untrained women who are pulling off feats that the most powerful men in galactic history would've had trouble with? Hmmmmm.....bet that was a coincidence too right?<br><br>And what's with Luke's character being so completely destroyed? He goes from seeing the good in Darth Vader the man who was basically known as the face of all evil in the galaxy to wanting to kill his teenage nephew because he sensed a "growing darkness" in him? Are you for real right now?? And we all know Luke would never have just thrown his father's lightsaber over his shoulder nonchalantly like that. For all the people trying to defend Luke in this movie even Mark Hamill himself said this character wasn't Luke Skywalker so there's no use in arguing about it. Even Luke himself disagrees with Luke's character in this movie.<br><br>Rose IS worse than Jar Jar. Don't try to justify her as a character because it can't be done. She contributes NOTHING to this movie. In fact she actually substantially takes away from the movie. Her little anti-capitalist political messages are so forced it feels like rape. Not to mention she robbed Finn of what would've been his crowning moment and almost killed him in the process because she "loves" him even though she's spent 2 days MAX around him. For all of her "we win by saving what we love not killing what we hate" that stunt she pulled would've literally destroyed the entire resistance if Luke's astral image hadn't shown up. She is...undisputedly...unarguably...SOLIDLY and FACTUALLY the WORST character in the entire franchise's history including the EU. Taking her out of the movie would've giving this movie a much higher rating.<br><br>And how do you justify a Jedi master dying as a result of casting an image? I understand this isn't the EU but they could at least pretend like this takes place in the same galaxy as the EU. In the EU Luke was able to cast an image of an entire fleet coming out of hyperspace and made the image so strong that it fooled a Sith Lord who was more powerful than Vader and he was barely breathing hard as a result. But here he DIES by casting an image of one person.....pathetic way for Luke Skywalker the HERO OF STAR WARS to die!<br><br>And how do they have Luke Skywalker being so convincingly overpowered by a teenage rookie who even with years of training almost lost to half a group of fighters who showed no evidence of being force sensitives? And then imply that Luke would've lost the duel to Kylo Ren if he'd been there in person? That would imply that the red guards could've handed Luke's butt to him. Not to mention Luke getting overpowered by Rey who was 3-4 days into her lack of training. Based on this stuff I'm pretty sure Padawan Kenobi could've taken every Force user in this movie by himself. Except for maybe Snoke (maybe).<br><br>They completely turned General Hux the ridiculously serious commander in TFA into the butt of every joke and generally a laughing stock in this movie. That little prank Poe pulled on Hux at the beginning was mildly funny for the first second or so and then the joke ran for an obnoxiously long period of time. There was no reason for it and it did nothing for the movie. It belittled a GREAT character into nothing more than a gag.<br><br>Oh and the casino planet in general was so horrible that it not only took away from the movie it took away from the entire franchise as a whole.<br><br>Of course this movie had (a few) good moments here and there such as the hyperspace ram which would've been much better if they'd had Admiral Ackbar make that sacrifice rather than having Admiral Gender Studies a complete unknown in the story steal the big moment while Ackbar gets an offscreen death. Imagine how much more emotional and inspired the audience would've been if Admiral Ackbar went out like that? But instead Admiral Feminazi makes the sacrifice and the entire audience is left thinking "who cares?". Like how stupid can the writers be? That change alone might've brought the audience score at least into the 50s. What a waste of potentially one of the greatest moments in the saga. There were other little moments that were fairly okay but not enough to make up for the disaster that this movie turned out to be.<br><br>This was visually the most stunning movie but that's about where the pros end for the most part other than the little moments here and there. It had a few good funny moments too (like Rey "reaching out"...I died at that scene!) but most of the humor was very force and misplaced. They tried too hard to turn this movie into an action comedy like Guardians of the Galaxy or something. <br><br>The score was the absolute most forgettable in the entire franchise and Star Wars is supposed to be known for its excellent music. <br><br>Overall this movie is the reason why I'm not longer excited for the upcoming Star Wars movies and the SOLE reason why I will no longer be going out of my way to watch Star Wars movies on opening night anymore. In fact I probably won't watch any of the future movies in theaters at all unless someone invites me and pays for my ticket. In fact I probably still wouldn't go then because I would be contributing funding into this nonsense and after what happened with this movie I feel like I can no longer spend money on this franchise at least as it relates to the movies.

 This film did NOT honor the saga's rich legacy. Rian Johnson did his utmost best to dishonor it as well as undermine the rich plot development that J.J. Abrams carefully set up in The Force Awakens.<br><br>Although Disney/Lucasfilm claims to support strong women's roles Rian went out of his way to direct scenes that portray women making disasterous leadership decisions with one even having to [SPOILER] sacrifice herself to fix things and another thwarting a potentially last ditch effort to save lives just to tell a guy she loved him.<br><br>As for the ridiculous?

 I love Star Wars always did. I'm sad to say The Last Jedi was terrible. The story was really bad. I didn't recognize the characters from Force Awakens. The new Star Wars movies I've seen more as free Star Wars movies rather than belonging to the original first three movies. The last jedi was bad as a sci-fi movie generally and terrible as a Star Wars. Actually I was so upset the night I got home from the movie that I had trouble sleeping. Here are a few things I felt was just awful. <br><br>Warning spoilers!<br><br>1. Po jokes with Hugs making the Empire look like something from Space balls. It wasn't fun just ridiculous.<br><br>2. Po attacks the Empire fleet all by himself without being shot down. The scene makes the empire into clowns.<br><br>3. Snoke makes fun of Kylo Rens helmet. The helmet was really awesome and making the Kylo Ren character great. Kylo destorys it in the beginning of the movie why? It was so cool we had a new masked "Vader character" obviously Rian Johnsson didn't feel the same way. <br><br>4. BB-8 becomes a robot to always save the day and a kind of Macgyver robot which can do everything.<br><br>5. Amiral Ackbar dies for no reason at all. This great character erazed for what? <br><br>6.The library of Jedi knights? What on earth is that? Lots of scriptures that Yoda makes clear is totally useless. Why are they trying to make a religion out of the force?<br><br>7. The purple haired lady controls a gigantic space ship by herself? Giving her life for the rebellion which only give you the feeling "who cares?". Who is that character? There is no background story to make it interesting.<br><br>8. The casino city does nothing to the story. <br><br>9. Snoke dies... who was he? And he dies way too easy. I quess he never was that powerful ... ? <br><br>10. Killing off great characters making it hard to make a good sequel.<br><br>11. Where do all rebells go in the end. Suddenly just a few are left. Where did all the other go?<br><br>12. Why did the whole rebel fleet consist of "bombers"?<br><br>13. Po doesn't care at all the many lives among the rebels taken because of him. Makes him a total a**hole making him totally out of character.<br><br>14. Why did the codebreaker give back a necklace worth a fortune. Doesn't go with his character.<br><br>15. The empire can't catch one rebel ship with their whole fleet. The empire seems totally incompetent.<br><br>16. Leia flies in space and suddenly gets superpowers.<br><br>17. BB-8 shoots money at enemies makes the movie look like a comedy.<br><br>18. Luke's out of character<br><br>19. Luke dies without any reason.<br><br>20. Finn's a coward trying to flee from the rebel ship so out of character.<br><br>21. Trying to make a romantic story between Rose and Finn failes. Why? Because there is no build up at all. <br><br>That's a few of the reasons why I feel The Last Jedi was crap. I give it 3 stars. This could have been a great movie but someone (Rian Johnsson) failed miserably. "The force is weak with this one!", 1.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976939415/, March 3 2018, N/A

 I left this movie feeling entertained. There were lots of flashy explosions cool sound effects great music...but the longer that I thought about the movie the more I realized how much I absolutely hated the movie. It was obviously a movie made to sell a specific message: If you're a girl and you want to be powerful Yoda will show up and retcon everything that the previous 7 movies (8 if you include Rogue One) has built: You have to work learn train and change in order to become the best version of yourself. Rey is a Mary Sue. I really wanted to like her character and I did enjoy her in VII because the amount of power she was exhibiting coupled with the mystery of her parents made it seem like she could be the spawn of two powerful Jedi. This movie took a complete dump on that and the answer is simply that Rey is super-powerful for no reason. There's a trumped up "half-fact" that retcons the whole concept of how the Force works and they did everything possible to destroy any semblance of what the original character of Luke Skywalker was like. This culminated in the demise of a character that had given inspiration to many young people over the last four decades and most definitely was NOT a good sendoff. Disney has stepped in it too far and it's pretty debatable whether fans and moviegoers will give Solo or IX a second thought. Time to go back to what works Disney not try to destroy everything that took 40 years to build simply because it's inconvenient for your marketing plans., 0.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977148669/, March 4 2018, N/A

 The visuals were good but the story is the worst I have ever seen and I'm not just talking Star Wars. I am talking every movie I have ever seen. Rey is a god and can do no wrong and does not need to train. She is stronger than Anakin and Luke at that age without any explanation or training. The storylines were all over the place and did not make sense. When a person is in space suddenly the lungs violently decompress and freeze shut form the moisture in the lungs freezing. Leia could not have survived not to mention floating back to a ship that is supposed to be moving quickly. That is just one example of the absolute stupidity brought to you by someone who had the time and the money but just failed any sort of intelligence check. The Finn in TFA tries to run away but ends up becoming a hero. The Finn in TLJ I gets reverted back to coward and then suddenly becomes brave. Luke is completely disrespected as if Rian actually hated the character. Propaganda themes everywhere in a freaking Star Wars movie. Misuse of captain phasma.. hi I'm back.. oops I'm dead in like t minutes on screen. To top it off if you disagree with the film you are a bigot!

 I honestly think that "The Last Jedi" is the BEST Star Wars film I've saw!

I don't mind about her at all. Rose and Finn's subplot was a bit confusing but okay. I would recommend watching the movie since it's SO emotional!<br><br>And for those hater who dislike the "The Last Jedi" SHAME ON YOU.<br><br>Overall: 10/10., 5.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977148517/, March 4 2018, N/A

 Rian Johnson completely RUINED Star Wars by catering to the 3rd wave feminist &amp SJW whiners castrating men of their masculinity and making the only REAL heroes women. Poe was constantly reprimanded for his heroics. Luke is no longer a hero of the rebellion but a cowardly masterless jedi. And Rey is not in the slightest related to the Skywalkers but instead a nobody who for some strange reason has a connection to Vader's/Luke's lightsaber and Kylo Ren.

 A poorly written film. It is clear that Johnson like Abrams before him has no knowledge of the lore of the Star Wars saga. Fan favorite characters are disrespected and killed off while even new characters like Snoke and fan favorite Phasma are reduced to being pitiful characters killed off without any further character development. Little is explained and what is explained isn't explained well. The film also fails to fix the issues from the previous film. Rey is still an overpowered Mary Sue and Kylo Ren still acts like a moody emo teen. Overall the film is a mess with far too many side plots that needlessly drag on. It opens with a childish yo momma joke and ends with a disappointing climax that rips off The Empire Strikes Back. I left the theater confused and disgusted with more questions than answers. I had expected the film to better than it's predecessor but instead it suffered from some of the same problems with some new ones thrown in. While I have little to say that is positive however I will say this: unlike Abrams who pretty much ripped off the original film Johnson actually tried to give us an original story. Yes it wasn't a very good story but it was an original story. While the film borrows partly from The Empire Strikes Back and surpisingly Return of the Jedi it cannot be called a remake of either film. That alone is a significant improvement over The Force Awakens and while I am disappointed with the results I can at least respect Johnson's originality. For my final verdict I'd have to say that while it may satisfy kids or a casual fan this is not a film for hardcore fans like me or those who want a good story. It's a popcorn flick something to occupy your time when there is nothing better to do but not something you'll want to see again and again., 2.0,  Thomas M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/957480528/, March 4 2018, N/A
 I am a huge Star Wars fan so I am grateful for the movie regardless of quality. I was disappointed as it seems like the storyline and the scenes wear rehashed version of scenes in previous movies. How many times must we see the Millennium Falcon chased in to tight quarters where only amazing flying gets them out and all that follow them hit things or blow trying to follow the MF. I mean this fan base is literally fanatic. Do they thing the base d that buys all the marketing and sleeps out for the tickets and sees the films double digit times would not recognize the rehashed themes and plot line? Lets give you the benefit of the doubt and say all of that was on purpose then your execution was even worse. IF you want to make a reference to something we know make it harder to see. Make it so we cannot predict what will happen. The storyline was predictable because it was so obviously rehashed. Do not insult your base. Do better and be better.

 Always have been a big Star Wars fan and completely can't believe how they destroyed the legacy with this movie. They really just crapped on Luke Skywalker and totally turned his character into absolutely nothing. I knew it too! I said they are gonna kill off Luke and totally make him out to be nothing! Luke Skywalker is Star Wars! You made him a bum hermit on a island milking some obscene aliens nasty boobs for disgusting milk! It's a total shame. Why does he die? What kills him! Old age? He not that old. If you kill Luke Skywalker he has to die epic. For that fact if you kill freaking Han Solo make it epic! Who that ever watched and loved Star Wars could ever read the script to this and go yeah sounds great! It's trash. It ruins Star Wars for so many old fans! I just can't see how to fix it now.

 A movie that suffers on 2 counts: 1) you get an a-typical out of character reaction from established characters: Luke Skywalker who crossed the galaxy on the 1% chance of saving his father is now prepared to lightsaber his nephew in his sleep. He's gone from this resilient fearless faith and bravery to this brooding depression outworking in cynicism (the one thing Luke felt like he would ever become) 2) It lacks an overarching storyline. It's like this movie is determined to go against the first movie deliberately being irreverent to core elements of the franchise like killing of characters that were only just being developed, 2.0,  Ryan M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976992082/, March 4 2018, N/A
 Complete disaster that leaves one wondering if irreparable harm has been done to Disney's Star Wars franchise. By "irreparable harm" I mean diminishing returns for all SW movies going forward and being left out of the cannon by Star Wars fans forever. <br>The Force Awakens was a disappointment mainly for its lack of originality and for taking the triumph of the ending of Return of the Jedi and making it a hallow victory in nearly every sense. Outside of that tough pill to swallow TFA was at least a funny movie with two likable new heroes and bad guy who was pretty awesome until he took his mask off. (You might be able to argue that the entire trilogy turned for the worse in that very act.) TFA also had a couple great scenes as its climax both in the tragic though heroic death of Han Solo and the moment Rey first lit a lightsaber - the billion dollar scene for Disney you can practically hear the cash registers going off as soon as a lightsaber lit in a woman's hands. <br>Unfortunately The Last Jedi has none of those things while continuing to destroy the OT in ways that TFA only hinted at. Rey has virtually nothing to do until the final 10 minutes of the movie. Her backstory is presented as a middle finger to all the Star Wars fans who wasted their time theorizing who she might be. (Personally I still don't buy it. I still believe Rey is Kylo's twin sister.) Finn has NOTHING to do and is thus given a side quest with as much relevance to the rest of the story as Monty Python's Quest for the Holy Grail. Oh Finn has a character arc. The problem is it is the exact same character arc as in TFA. Poe Dameron has a character arc. The problem is it is not only demeaning to men but also pretty insulting for the guy who practically single-handedly blew up Star Killer Base in the last movie. In this movie he is to realize he is a reckless moron and should stop being a reckless moron. Kylo Ren isn't even a character anymore. He is a plot device that does whatever the plot needs him to do at that moment. That essentially makes him similar to BB-8 without being cute or funny. <br>There are plotholes abound you can fly a Star Destroyer through. Frankly if I only talked about the plotholes the list would be longer than this entire review. Numerous attempts at humor that are cringe-worthy. Even though the very galaxy is at stake no one seems to be taking it very seriously. The new characters introduced - Rose and Admiral Holdo - both seem to be nominees for the Jar Jar Binks club. And don't even get me started on Luke Skywalker. Forget his character being consistent with the OT. His character isn't even consistent with TFA. <br>This is the first Star Wars movie that I will not see multiple times in the theater. It is the first that I will not buy. Frankly I don't know where Star Wars goes from here. If I was JJ Abrams I would treat this installment with the same amount of respect that Rian Johnson treated TFA... none., 1.0,  Shawn N, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/900967831/, March 4 2018, N/A

 The Last Jedi was the most disappointing Star Wars Movie to date. Disney Ms. Kennedy and Mr. Johnson are destroying a billion dollar franchise. The movie was just SJW and Feminist Propaganda. Luke who should be the EU version was just some pathetic weak old man. That isn't the Luke Skywalker I know and love. I will not being seeing the 9th movie. Side note you should make a movie for your target audience not people who will never see your movie. PS. Snoke should have been Plageuis., 0.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977147892/, March 4 2018, N/A

 Very dissapointing movie. While the visuals are mostly stunning it doesn't stand on it's own and even less as a sequel to The Force Awakens since most plot points or mysteries from that movie were thrown out or not even mentioned. Basically the plot of this movie goes nowhere significant except two very interesting and significant characters dying in a very underwhelming way. Luke's character is very different from what we remember him to be other characters in the movie make nonsensical choices that don't matter in the end and only serve to confuse or make the audience expect something exciting only to flat out be given something utterly mundane. <br><br>Rose as a new addition to the main characters is also meaningless and actually worsens many of the situations. I would argue that Admiral Holdo (the Resistance's one and only pixie commander) is the same way except she actually did something useful in the end even if it ended up not really mattering much either.<br><br>Rey's character development never happens and she's still as strong as ever without training. Humor is thrown in almost every scene that is supposed to be dramatic thus derailing it with the only successful joke being the scene when Luke finally gives one lesson to Rey and messes with her when she literally reaches out to touch the Force. And finally Phasma has even less of a role and impact in this movie than the last making her character's appearance on par with the nonexistant use of the Porgs in this film.<br><br>Overall this movie made me leave the theater empty and utterly devoid of any excitement for the next or for Star Wars in that matter. I give only 2 stars - for the visuals and that one actually funny scene in the entire movie with Luke and Rey., 2.0,  Eleonora S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977139929/, March 4 2018, N/A

 It's literally unbelievable that Lucasfilm would release this. It's as if a child wrote the screenplay. I find it extremely odd that the critics reviews of this film were positive. It leads one to believe that Disney initiated "Operation Damage Control" prior to its release and they've honestly been doing so ever since. Sorry Mickey Mouse but your attempts at the old Jedi mind trick to try to convince us that this movie is anything but utter shit is just not working and future of this franchise does not look good at all. It truly saddens me to say that as a lifelong fan since seeing A New Hope at the drive in theater at 4 years old in 1977 I'm now completely indifferent as to where Star Wars is heading.

 Bad movie bad star wars movie... this movie grabbed the idiot ball and held on. Sorry this is going to be hate filled.<br><br>Ok so now we are confirmed that the Republic fell like a rotting house when the door was kicked in.<br><br>The Poe and Hux dialogue while funny doesn't belong in the movie unless your creating a Saturday morning cartoon. Also do dreadnoughts not have shields and why would you have bombers that physically need to drop something... in Space!!! Why not torpedo bombers like Y-Wings or B-Wings. Also why are the rest of the Star Destroyers just sitting their jacking off. Seriously that was the most anti-climatic space battle ever. Seriously I cannot get over how stupid the bombers were seriously who would ever design something like that for SPACE combat.<br><br>Moving from the opening stupidity we know the First Order is weeks away from conquering every important system in the galaxy but was afraid of a Fleet orbiting what... 5 systems? How big is the Order supposed to be to be worried about that and yet be able to steam roll the galaxy? Seriously does no-one have a planetary defense force was the whole of the Republic fleet sitting above those Five-ish Planets. How the hell would you even police a galaxy let alone defend it with so small a force. Hell one of the reasons the Separatist crisis emerged was because the Old Republic could't police the old Republic and enforce its laws. In the OT it made sense to see small concentrations of ships. The Rebellion was a tiny group fighting against a massive empire holding down the galaxy. As for the Empire one they were holding down the galaxy and two its a big place the rebellion could be anywhere. The only time we needed to see fleets was at Endor where the Rebels brought their entire fleet which was still relatively small and the Imperial Fleet again relatively small present was one that could be moved without anyone noticing.<br><br>Ok for the flight from the Resistance base... really they're running out of gas? I realize I let my car run until the light comes on before I refuel it but that's a really bad idea for a military or quasi military organization. Or are they suggesting they had no fuel reserves because that's like a big thing. I mean this movie takes place moments have Force Awakens so its not like the burnt it up fighting and they couldn't have used it up fleeing. Hell we've seen ships fly across the galaxy without refueling Vader's fleet crusided around the Rim without a replenishment ship... unless the Executor carried fuel for her little sisters but that's never come up before. So apparently they were sitting around on "E" because they're... dumb.<br><br>Do they still use Hypermatter as fuel btw because doesn't that shit last like forever?<br><br>So them running from the First Order fleet this started off good... apart from the forgetting to fuel the ships... the attack when it first emerged was cool though again the Star Destroyers sitting around and jacking off was dumb. The fighter combat was cool though why couldn't we have had another maybe good space battle? Snoke's ship was interesting but from everything we've heard its a factory ship not a combat ship. Though I'll give them props for at least giving it a sizable escort. Also don't Star Destroyer have like a hundred guns why do we only ever see like one or two shots?<br><br>When they blew up the bridge I was super impressed... that would have been a good death for Princess Leia and really you could have given the rest of her lines to the Vice Admiral whoever but then they blew it. I mean really Leia can survive being spaced... we've never had any indication that she's had force raising let alone enough to SURVIVE IN THE VACUUM OF SPACE and then pull herself back into the ship however minutes later. Also now we know you have shields while the hell weren't they on before the fighters came... seriously do shields only matter when its relevant to the plot?<br><br>Also Ackbar died... I did realize it was even him until Poe said something... kinda a demotion there admiral went from the Admiral of the entire rebel fleet to... six ships?<br><br>Casino planet is... meh though it does bring up a rather stupid plot hole. So the rich people are arms dealers or mostly arms dealers so apparently they're are no rich shipping magnates actors sports players whatever but OK I assume she was generalizing. Selling guns however to a war machine capable of overrunning the galaxy in weeks... really? I mean if would understandable if this was a small terrorist like group but a war machine of this size? Even if she was talking about the Arms Industry I still don't buy it. I mean if that's the case a galaxy-conquering war machine was built without anyone knowing it and how they hell did the First Order pay for it? No one got sucpsions when someone was doing R&ampD for new Star Destroyers or TIE fighters? Seriously they couldn't have gone with secret shipyards in the Unknown Regions built by the Empire prior to its fall?<br><br>The fall of the Jedi Temple... I kinda like the idea of Luke being so afraid of releasing another Darth Vader that he'd consider drastic actions only to decide against it and for Ren to misunderstand. Its kinda of a cliche but hey its a reason why he's so broken. But again really Kylo Ren thought he killed Luke... shouldn't there have been a massive galaxy shaking disturbance if Luke Skywalker Jedi Grand Master died. Did he not check physically or use the Force to check that's seems lazy especially if you believe the guy wants to kill you. Also where did he meet Snoke? He's not a guy that can really blend in.<br><br>Luke's "let the Jedi End" was weak. I mean really as long as they're are Sith or other Dark Side equivalents they're has to be someone to fight. Luke's entire attitude struck me as moral cowardice. I realize he was a broken man but still saying 'let the galaxy burn' is bad. The only way to really win and end the Dark-light squabble is to take Kreia's route and murder the Force itself... though the consequences might be... dire. Also the Force now is trippy and Yoda came back to tell Luke Rey is awesome not when he ran away not when he abandoned the Galaxy to the Dark Side not to suck it up and go fight the good fight but to tell Luke how awesome Rey is. Whatever happen to show don't tell.<br><br>Now to the female Vice-Admiral who apparently decided to wear formal wear while a member of the Resistance and a Second Galactic Civil War is starting. Did you not have time to change and look professional? Were you at all ball or cocktail party... or with dinosaurs? How many Admirals are in this six-ish ship fleet anyway? Also the disrespect she gives Poe who at this point is most likely the senior pilot officer and the defacto Wing Commander is astounding. Yes he disobeyed orders but seriously praise in public criticize in private... where the hell did she get her admiral's bars? We later learn this was because they (writers) were setting up the big reveal of a planet that's apparently not on any maps and apparently their sensors can't detect? Even then all she would of had to do is tell Poe one of her most senior officers this and it would have ended the issue. Instead she tells him to have hope... hope is not a plan lady hope is wishful thinking. Hell she could have said "trust me there is a plan" instead of giving off the vibe that they're was none but no have hope because hope is more powerful then star destroyers.<br><br>Rehash of RotJ throne room scene.<br><br>God that was cringy... like bad fan fiction levels levels of cringy. Most of the Rey/Kylo stuff is OK and even good but Snoke is just... the Emperor but not the Emperor. Also creating a Force bond across lightyears... and fucking with Ren's emotions to deceive Rey ok but then how can you then not realize that Ren is going to betray you. Hell you can only kick the dog so often and to make it worse couldn't it have been more telegraphed for the audience. The fight with the Red totally not Imperial Guard was ok but I think both Rey and Rentend to forget they have Force powers well they'd really be useful. To give them credit I was ecstatic that Kylo Ren wasn't redeemed that would have been too much. Kinda disappointed Rey didn't join him not that I expected her too. Also side note I kinda want them to screw now is that weird. I think they have odd but good chemistry.<br><br>Also Snoke is dead... all that build up all that mystery for what totally not surprising surprise and funny face joke?<br><br>The destruction of the Supremacy was a cool shot but kinda dumb. I mean if its that easily why not rig up remote control ships and just jump them into others. You created another plot hole that didn't a have to be there. Also I don't think that's how hyperspace works. You are in a different "dimension" or something... I mean you have to watch out for planets and other celestial bodies because they cast mass shadows. Also the MonCal ship waited a long time before turning while her shuttles got shot up. I thought she was going to turn and engage which would have been cool-ish and a little more dramatic... also Phasma died... ok why did we need her back?<br><br>The crystal planet... seriously guys that was a fucking horrible plan if they even had one. I mean there are what like 100ish members left and they threw away how many? Also what the hell were they flying... salt surfing skimmers that can kinda maybe fly when needed. If they can fly why didn't a few fly up to fight the TIEs? Christ that was stupid and also why did the Asian lady stop Fynn from where I was sitting it probably would have worked and prevented the breach... wasn't that the point? What did all the redshirts die for then? If I want to watch the Battle of Hoth I can watch Empire<br><br>Astral/Force projection over lightyears? I mean it is Luke Skywalker and he is on a Force nexus so... Ok. The fight was Ok too though I wonder what made Kylo Ren think he could take Luke Skywalker. You can't beat the lady who STILL hasn't had a minute of actual light-saber or a real Force training session and you think you can beat the guy who beat Darth Vader? I mean this is Luke fucking Skywalker<br><br>Luke's death was meh. I mean he allowed the Resistance to escape so... yeah but come on that's how he dies a heart attack or something from strain?<br><br>So at the end of the movie... where back at episode III ending. Evil Empire controls the galaxy how I have no idea and new plucky band of rebels is forming to fight the First Order. God people is this what we waited for... a worse ripoff of the OT at least the prequels did something new they expanded the universe and told an original story. Worse even this invalidates everything the original Rebellion fought for. After less that thirty years the Republic they struggled and bled and died to restore fell apart at the first whiff of trouble. If's that's not a betrayal... <br><br>I wanted to like this movie... I wanted to like the Force Awakens but I can't... its it's its... bad.<br><br>The way I look at it the prequels were a failing of execution not of story. The story was largely there but how they brought it to life was flawed. If you look beyond bad dialogue and poor acting the Prequels are one of the greatest tragedies in fiction. Beyond the Tragedy of Darth Vader it was the fall of the Old Republic the Republic that has stood for ten thousand years as a beacon of light in the darkness of civilization and the ideal that all the species of the galaxy can come and work together as equals. Is it perfect? No. No system or government is but it was something truly grand. In the end the Republic was brought low not through barbarian invasions or outside threats but by the weakness of those who should have strengthen it. By the failings and the corruption of the organs of government to the blindness of its greatest guardians to perhaps worst of all to the apathy of the common people who allowed democracy to die. The story and the potential greatness is there behind the flaws which is something I thought the existing EU now legends allowed to come to the fore.<br><br>The new trilogy or at least the first two movies are not good stories., 1.0,  Josh H, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/950029699/, March 3 2018, N/A

 Misandry. Angry radical femi-nazis in American corporate culture and society at large in a misguided attempt to topple a non-existent patriarchy have conspired destroyed threatened and ultimately connived themselves into positions of authority and power. The result is a full-spectrum attack on anything masculine or perceived to be masculine. This WAR on men has moved into popular culture and infected Hollywood to the core. Cherished and beloved intellectual properties are systematically being re-written altered and destroyed to appeal to the political machinations of these hate filled lunatics consisting of radical feminists homosexuals and minorities. Star Wars is no exception. It is in fact the crown jewel in this vast establishment partisan and corrupted conspiracy under the false flag of progressive-ism (rest in peace Upton Sinclair - these wack jobs have no idea who you were or what you represented). The result is a movie that at its best is badly mediocre and at its worst awful beyond measure. A life long Star Wars fan I am done with this franchise forever. Moreover I will extended this exclusion to anything produced by Walt Disney as establishment corporate culture and vile propaganda. There are real problems in this world from over-population climate change to resource depletion. The solution proposed by the elites is to create a broad class of enthralled females eliminate males and promote homosexuality. This movie is designed to champion these values in manners both subtle and gross. Men are presented as: stupid weak emotional and evil Women are presented as strong perfect thoughtful strategic and wise. The Daisy Ridley character is the ULTIMATE "mary sue" and every other character is in reality totally inconsequential. That however is only one part of this painful two hour odyssey insofar as the "Chinese girl" is beyond repulsive the purple haired general offensively obnoxious and Lea herself ridiculously "god like."

 The way I looked forward to The Last Jedi is similar to how much I looked forward to Alien: Covenant. With Prometheus Ridley Scott setup a lot of possibilities to explore with a sequel. Then Alien Covenant comes out and turns into just a crappy Alien movie. So many possibilities. The Force Awakens introduced a lot of new characters and story lines and questions. I was so looking forward to see where the sequel took the franchise. Right from the start the movie just bombs. Instead of exploring new stories and expand on the characters the movie just turned it a stockpile of mixed humor and did not give the audience time to get attached to the story. Maybe because there really wasn't a story. I don't know. I did not enjoy the movie at all. The prequels felt more Star Wars than this movie. Sorry but there is just nothing I can think of from the movie that I enjoyed. Worst of all it does not set up the 3rd movie in such a way that I look forward to it much like The Force Awakens did. After I watched The Force Awakens my friends and I were saying how we hated that we had to wait 2 years to find out where the film goes next and what happens to Luke Rey.

 Not the worst movie but sadly nothing special. The movie was far too long to have such little character development. Any chance this film has of making the viewer feel something is often sabotaged by an awkward attempt at comedy.

 I'm delighted to see that this turkey sank off the RT "top ten" in box office sales weeks ago while "Jumanji" which was released at the same time is still in the top ten and going strong. Not that Jumanji is a great film (it isn't) but this is a testament to just how BAD "The Last Jedi" is. TLJ by far is one of the most putrid films ever made and hopefully its failure at the box office and its MANY MANY bad reviews will be a learning experience for Disney: don't trash original characters and don't make a film primarily based on the narrow-minded ideals of social-justice warriors.

 The Last Jedi is by no means the worst film ever made like a lot of fans are making it out to be. I thought Mark Hammill and Carrie Fisher put on stellar performances the island scenes were top-notch and the space and land battles were phenomenal. However the movie is deeply hurt by some crippling flaws. I could go on about how there's too much CGI some clunky dialogue and a good 30-45 minutes of screentime that could've been cut but the biggest issue with this film is the lack of backstory to accompany Snoke and The First Order. Without proper context as to how Snoke Kylo and the First Order came out of nowhere in 30 years it seems like we're just watching a fan fiction follow-up film that is slaughtering all the characters we cared about in the OT. With The Force Awakens J.J. Abrhams did a successful job of relaunching the Star Wars franchise and setting up several plot mysteries such as Snoke's origin Rey's parents and the mystery behind the First Order. With The Last Jedi Rian Johnson has chosen to flat-out ignore explaining the burning questions fans had from Episode 7 and it feels like a slap to the face. Episode 9 is going to have a lot of its work cut out as it has A LOT of backstory and mystery to iron out and explain to Star Wars fans. We demand answers and drastically better writing., 2.0,  Spencer S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/904373369/, March 3 2018, N/A

 No honestly. All the reviews must have been bought. I cannot see how this is a good movie in any instance. I'm a big Star Wars Fan and liked both the Original Trilogy and the Prequels and while the Prequels were definitely no masterpieces they were still pretty enjoyable and had the feeling of legit star wars movies. Not this one. I was extremely disappointed with Ep. 7 too but i could see the appeal and overall i had fun. But watching Ep. 8 was a pretty unsatisfying experience.

 I loved The force awakens but the last Jedi was much better film With tension pretty much the whole way through the film and often taking an unexpected turn some of which I understand many people don't like. But as a piece of film most of the decisions worked a treat . Mark Hamill was superb with a career best performance and Carrie Fisher shined in what would be her final performance. I love this film  although I didn't love everything about it. I say to those who like is less than the preqels seriously! what is the matter with you? I think and hope that in time it will be recognised as one of the best instalments in the Star Wars saga!, 4.0,  Mark T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977145373/, March 3 2018, N/A

 I always knew that Disney's purchase of the Star Wars franchise was inevitably going to ruin it. Luke's character assassination was unforgivable. Leia's Mary Poppins scene in space was a joke and low hanging fruit for youtube mockery. There's a SJW narrative that lingers throughout. The characters don't have the chemistry that the original trilogy did. Hollywood (and Disney by extension) seem more focused on selling toys pushing the usual agendas and questionable casting.

 In short: Not as bad as the prequels but worse than the original trilogy or force awakens. If you like every half-dramatic moment broken up by a sarcastic quip you'll probably like this movie. But then again they already made a sequel to Guardians of the Galaxy.<br><br>In Long: A new director takes over with no clear sense of where the story should go so everything seems like a set up to a series of terrible jokes. The actual story the movie does try to tell has so many plot holes it is almost nonsensical. The acting is fine and the special effects are great but at the end of the day there is simply no compelling story to pull it all together. There is also no clear sense of character development or rationale for the decisions made so that every line carries an even greater sense of being a set piece designed solely to set up another terrible pun.

 Objectively this movie was good but subjectively this movie to me was nothing but wasted potential. The main male characters barely have any character development and Finn gets sidelined. Some of the characters are horrifyingly out-of-character. Luke's character gets *destroyed* because the director has a boner for fascist redemption arcs and it was all for nothing in the end anyway. Luke's character got destroyed for That.<br><br>The OT makes me the happiest and so do the ending to each one of those movies.

 The audience score is rigged ( 1/2 star votes don't count) and the critics' score is ridiculously high but could Rotten Tomatoes change the "critics consensus" at last? The consensus is hardly accurate by any standards:<br>- "Star Wars: The Last Jedi honors the saga's rich legacy"<br>No no it doesn't. It dishonors everything in the saga we've seen this far and denigrates the characters and the lore.<br>- "while adding some surprising twists"<br>Surprising twists? More like unexpected letdowns and unconvincing turns. <br>- "and delivering all the emotion-rich action" <br>Mostly it's boring and the action is mediocre at best. Good-looking though but not very interesting or exciting action.<br>- "fans could hope for."<br>No. This is a straight out lie. Fans are shocked and enraged of this filth Rian Johnson has delivered. Beloved characters are disgraced and the whole state of the SW universe is a complete mess now. I've been a Star Wars fan since the early '80s and it's painful to see the most greatest scifi-universe to end like this.

 Why is this film so many negative reviews. Why care about a film so much?<br><br>Why do so many people feel so angry what has generated scores of vitriolic YouTube rants. And why do I feel the need to watch and read so many of them every day checking for new ones?<br><br>I think I want to be in the company of true Star Wars fans. The people that used to come together to feel warmly about a story that meant something for them as they grew up. It is more than just a franchise they truly were special or at least they used to be. The Last Jedi has forever taken away that status for many fans we know come together vent our spleens. This isn't Marvel you can't reboot this with new actors they had one chance to complete the saga with the original actors and they blew it.<br><br>And I am not some Alt Right Fanboy I do not collect toys play Battlefront or know the whole extended Universe (not that there is anything wrong with doing that). I just love the films. Also I am just the sort of left-leaning Snowflake that SJW content should appeal to. But something comes before that in filmmaking- TAKING THE AUDIENCE WITH YOU. I could have bought Luke's conversion to grump IF they had sold it to me properly and earned it. <br><br>So what is wrong? You probably know all about the plot holes and the treatment of Luke. The contradictory "what is heroic sacrifice for" message the "on the nose" political lessons so I won't labour them again. For me the greatest crime is that it leaves you not caring what happens in Episode IX. Because Lucasfilm have already decreed that there will be no CGI Carrie Fisher we know that Leia has to die off screen so presumably (unlike Han) there will be some kind of funeral or memorial service to mark this. Who will be in this scene? Characters that have little or no screen history with her? I guess they will have Chewbacca make a noise and Luke appear as a Force Ghost. But now we know that Leia Poppins has tremendous Force powers where will her Force Ghost be?<br><br>And what about Rey? She is the hero of this trilogy despite having very little character development. She now has no history to discover and no powers to train or perfect she already is complete. So where do you take her? The only thing that keeps springing to my mind is that as Kylo told her that her parents were "nobodies" maybe they were literally "no-one". Going one step further than Anakin she has no mother either and the people that sold her for "drinking money" found her under a bush or something. At least that would explain her complete mastery the Force without training.<br><br>Alas the feeling seems to be that "creators" seemed determined to turn this saga into some kind of "Twilight" in space forcing a love story between our "Hero" and someone we know to be a Homicidal maniac (patricide village of women and children). But I guess that is a subversive idea for a family film so it'll happen.<br><br>I leave you with an analogy. It's like when someone buys football team. The "team" only really exists as an idea in the minds of the supporters (players management and even stadiums change). It is up to the new owners to take care of the idea look after it and ensure that the supporters continue to believe in it. Disney and Lucasfilm just did an MK Dons. We just have to dream that Episode IX is AFC Wimbledon. Maybe we'll be surprised I live in hope.<br><br>(Sorry I don't know an American equivalent but if you don't know- a football team was bought owners moved it to another city supporters felt completely shafted so stopped supporting it eventually setting up a replacement team in the original location)<br><br>1 star for cinematography design and music and also for Mark Hamill's efforts and dignity in the face of what can only be called "character assassination"., 1.0,  Mark J, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/900765423/, March 1 2018, N/A

 One of the best Star Wars movies very thought provoking. Beautiful cinematography excellent special effects Luke Rey Ben Finn Poe and Rose all get interesting character arcs. My genuine reaction after first viewing was very much the same as how the characters on TBBT were exhausted in a positive way after seeing TFA for the first time in "The Opening Night Excitation". Any of the apparent plot holes or character inconsistencies are easily dismissed with either a bit of thought or a proper understanding of the prequels (most of the people complaining are those whose view of star wars only contains the original trilogy whereas the themes and concepts presented in the prequels when properly understood explain these supposed discrepancies).<br><br>Overall it continues themes presented in the prequels as well as the original trilogy and so it feels like it ties together the whole saga thus far. I am excited to see how the finale will wrap all this up and lead the themes to their proper conclusions.

 Disney is milking Mark Hamill's sea cow with this new SW trilogy by poorly repeating the first episodes all over again (Albeit with new tech). Rian Johnson's TLJ is just the nail in the coffin: bad acting from many (but not all) characters ridiculous script and plot the list goes on for a while (just read any of the posts here). The only positive note was the visual spectacle and the score so I can see Disney's SW becoming a new "Transformers-like saga" under Rian Johnson's leadership which is not necessarily a bad thing... but as Mark Hamill pointed out: "Just because a film makes a lot of money doesn't mean it's a great film".

 Really disappointing movie. I created an account to voice my opinion and I don't usually do that sort of thing because well who really needs another opinion on the internet? But because I love Star Wars so much and was so hyped for this film and the travesty of what I saw on screen last night I have to cast my vote. Really it comes down to poor story telling and lack of vision on Rian Johnson's part. I'm really surprised they gave him a whole new trilogy to play with. Force flying Leia??? Some things sound cool and some things just don't translate when you see them this failed on all fronts and seriously was the beginning of my viewing experience when I realized "Oh man I don't think I'm liking this movie". IX will ultimately solidify my opinion of VIII but with a catchphrase of "This is not going to go the way you think" it absolutely went the way I thought. (Spoilers) In the day and age of GOT and The Walking Dead where well established characters get offed regularly and in sometimes horrifying ways it was painfully obvious that Luke would be no more. If they really wanted to shock us he would have survived this film. There were some really cool moments but all in all the more I think about this film the less and less I like it. That being said I will be seeing it at least two more times due to making commitments with friends and family. The difference is I won't be looking forward to seeing it again as I did with TFA and RO. Rian Johnson please don't make another Star Wars film. Thank you.<br><br>Update: With seeing Rian Johnson and many other celebrity responses to any sort of unfavorable opinion to the film as "Angry Fan Boys" is really the icing on the cake and the hallmark of realizing that he messed up and made a really poor film. I tell people that liked the film that I'm happy they enjoyed it. That's great! I don't want to ruin anything for anyone but then you have Disney and Johnson trying to dismiss negative opinion which isn't as minor as they'd like the world to believe as spoiled brats who didn't get what they wanted is just insulting and honestly is very upsetting. From once being a huge fan and liked where the franchise was going with TFA and RO they have now someone actively rooting against SOLO and Ep IX. I will no longer be seeing any Star Wars films opening night and will be very cautious on seeing any future films with the Star Wars name in theaters henceforth.<br><br>Update #2: I will not buy this on DVD and I am OCD when it comes to being a completist with my records or movies but this is the only way at this point left to protest monetarily this horrible piece of cinema., 0.5,  Nick H, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976927867/, March 2 2018, N/A

 Abysmal failure of a Star Wars film To many ideas and things from original trilogy to many plot holes This movie destroyed everything meaningful about this franchise. How can anyone even go back to the original films and have any respect for Luke and his hero's journey knowing how things turn out in the end? The second most offensive aspect of this movie (after destroying Luke's entire back story and character) was the in your face social social justice diatribe. nobody has to be special or go through any personal journey and rigorous training to be a Jedi heck everyone can do it. After two movies it is obvious that Rey can do anything so it is impossible for her to grow as a character. Full of plot holes and contrivances involving characters nobody cares about. A Disney reboot and retelling of the entire franchise that destroys the entire cannon also Laura Dern's character was an absolute joke. Such cringeworthy characters Rey is basically a Jedi Knight already with virtually zero training. In The Force Awakens she could fly anything fight anything use the force and even defeat Kylo Ren. I thought at least The Last Jedi might help explain that aspect of Rey as to why she's perfect but it turns out no she just is and that's that. And to boot she don't need no training from Luke. That's poor lazy writing - male or female. She's not an interesting character. ?new films are so disappointing.

 I went in with high hopes they were dashed within the first 5 minutes. Awkward and un-necessary humour terrible sub-plot involving a casino and some awful CGI rabbit-horses under-developed wildcard character in the form of Benicio del Toro (what exactly does this character add to the story?) introduction of a deeply annoying character in Rose (aka JarJar 2.0) and worst of all - Luke Skywalker. How could Rian Johnson take a beloved character and write such an awful story for him I see why Hamill was frustrated. <br><br>The high(low) point for me was Rose crashing her speeder into Finn in order to stop him from sacrificing himself. 1) not physically possible given the speeds they were all going 2) just no.<br><br>Woeful cringeworthy and deeply frustrating instalment in the franchise., 0.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977005210/, March 2 2018, N/A

 Holy moly. The film does not pick up where the last movie left us.The Resistance blew up Starkiller Base the probably most resource-eating project in the history of the universe and the First Order emerges from that incident stronger than before?

 I don't mind change but lots of the decisions made for this film didn't make sense at all. It's left the trilogy in a mess. What with the unexplained parts in the Force Awakens and now just huge parts of this film leaving you scratching your head it's very disappointing. This film did not get the balance right in keeping the fan base happy and making it accessible to a wider audience. After waiting nearly 40 years to see what became of my childhood hero Luke 'galaxy saviour' Skywalker I'm left disillusioned. StarWars is a classic fairytale not a political commentary on 21st century western social angst. Yes the dialogue has never been top-notch but did we need a fallen idol bitter and twisted? <br>So many things could have been done with this trilogy it really is a missed opportunity. When ep IX I'll probably go watch the competing film. The magic of StarWars has fizzled for me.

 ahem...<br><br>If I was Hux the moment I saw the painfully slow bombers come near to Snoke's ship I would have ordered to move that ship some km away...<br>Too easy?<br><br>Rian Johnson is a tool.

Do you know it Rian?<br><br>- Fuel? Gasoline? Naphtha? What the fuck Rian? When I heard fuel I was expecting dark smoke clouds coming from the rear of the ships...<br><br>- Laser beams that lose power after some distance? In space without any resistance? Or there is air in space? Which would also explain why Leia survived and no one got sucked out of the ship when they opened the door. <br>I suspect that Rian Johnson thinks there is air in space...<br><br>- Laser beams that move in arcs?

 A simple error which has not been noticed by anyone until now but is so HUGE that once you see it you will shit bricks:<br><br>Admiral Holdo (AKA Purple Hair Gender Studies in a Party Dress) having seen all of the rebellion (sorry resistance albait the two terms are not synonyms) ships destroyed but the one with her lover Princess (sorry General. Nobility is bad as much as wealth and being male and/or white) Leia decides to sacrifice herself and the Raddus by lightspeed-ramming Snokes's ship.<br><br>Cool. Incredible visual spectacle. <br><br>People defending this by saying: "Since no one came up with this idea before it should be considered as a genial and impromptu invention of admiral Holdo. No one did it in the preceding 7 (SEVEN) movies simply because no one thought about it."<br><br>mmmmKey. The IQ in the galaxy far far away was really low then. And also that of George Lucas and J.J. Abrams... right Rian? <br><br>So... why is General Hux SCARED TO DEATH when he realizes what Holdo is doing? Why does he yell to his subordinates to destroy that ship on the spot? Without lightspeed the Raddus would have simply crashed on the shields of Snoke's ship without causing any damage AT ALL.<br><br>(We have seen it in Rogue One when the Empire ships jump out of hyperspace really near to the rebellion ships which were about to leave the scene the rebellion ships ram into the Empire ships and are completely obliterated without even scratching them.)<br><br>Hux CLEARLY knows that she will destroy Snoke's ship with that manouver. This means that HE KNOWS that manouver. Even his subordinates know it!<br><br>So WHY THE HELL didn't he or anyone else use it before?<br><br>Maybe because all 7 preceding movies would then have lasted 5 minutes???<br><br>Rian Johnson is as incompetent as lazy and this error only demonstrates it abundantly. <br><br>He should have had Hux laughing at the poor attempt of Holdo thus showing that he did not know that lightspeed-ramming a ship would completely destroy it., 1.0,  Paula J, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977143340/, March 2 2018, N/A
 When you whine about George Lucas raping your childhood when you cry for Star Wars to be put in someone else's hands you get The Last Jedi. I hope all of the people that trolled Lucas for years are happy now. Look what you've created an abomination. Ironically it's the same people that ripped Lucas and the prequels apart that are now crying for Lucas' return and this movie stricken from canon. Quick review.......Rian Johnson really doesnt know jack about Star Wars or understand how the Star Wars formula works. He doesn't understand what makes these films tick. He doesn't understand the force or the Jedi or Luke Skywalker. For a guy that is a self proclaimed Star Wars nerd he really came out of this looking completely ignorant on the subject. The film is so incoherent and such a mess that even the worst prequel film looks superior. Disney's lack of confidence in The Last Jedi has now resulted in the return of JJ Abrams to "rescue" Star Wars and bring back the fans. Which means another fan service film. We can expect a rip off of Return of the Jedi. I think if I were going to pick up the phone and call anyone to save the franchise it would be the creator himself. No matter what some may say I think Lucas should be heavily involved in some capacity., 1.5,  Andrew R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/936027748/, March 2 2018, N/A
 ....aaaaaand the price for the best bought comment goes to:<br><br>Jake R<br><br>"Expertly expanding on the saga's rich source material with newfound vision &amp stamina THE LAST JEDI is nothing short of a triumph. Exploring a massive cast with equally colossal storyline director Rian Johnson misdirects viewers' expectations in all the right ways without sacrificing the lore of the series or bogging down progression with unnecessary plot. This is one of the most exciting entries in the franchise with dazzling visual effects and masterful performances most notably from Daisy Ridley Adam Driver John Boyega Oscar Isaac and the beloved Mark Hamill. TLJ proves that Disney is far more than capable of taking this series to new heights creating a new sci-fi classic that excels. Without a doubt this is a blockbuster masterpiece of 2017."<br><br>- Expertly? An amateur film student could have produced a better script with less plot holes pace issues and tone errors.<br><br>- Newfound vision? I concede this. In fact this movie IS NOT STAR WARS. Is something else and therefore new. If you don't like Star Wars this is the movie for you. But please don't come here to teach real fans what Star Wars is. You obviously don't know it.<br><br>- Nothing short of a triumph? For who? The millennials pissing in their pants when they see an almighty girl who is never menaced and never hurt never has to grow or deserve the abilities she has? Or the feminazis who get their pants wet by watching an absolutely incompetent admiral womansplaining a hero or a geriatric princess slapping him for doing what heroes do? Or is it a triumph for social justice warriors who are more than happy of freeing animals which will be recaptured in 5 minutes while completely forgetting to care about enslaved children?<br><br>- Colossal storyline? Go watch on youtube. Thousands of videos mocking this movie and the hack who directed it. A colossal pile of shit.<br><br>- Rian Johnson misdirects. OK you are right. And he does it big time!<br><br>- Without sacrificing the lore of the series: LOL this is the exact opposite of the truth. Rian Johnson ruined the lore and destroyed the OT characters. Even in the old movies.<br><br>- Without bogging down progression with unnecessary plot: LOL the whole Internet is shitting on the Canto Bight scene for this exact reason. You are pathetic. Or stupid. Or both.<br><br>- Masterful performances most notably from Daisy Ridley Adam Driver John Boyega Oscar Isaac: LOL if they used wooden puppets no one would have noticed the difference. Wait. Are we sure they didn't use them?<br><br>- Taking this series to new heights: You'll see empty theaters when Solo and Episode IX will come out.

 If considered in isolation - The Last Jedi delivers an entertaining status-quo adventure space-epic for the big screen. In context of the franchise itself - the film consciously subverts and dashes the preceding character and story development so heavily that fans may no longer know what to look forward to. Although containing arguably the greatest light-saber fight scene in the anthology its lack of restraint for comedy is sure to timestamp the film with contemporary humor certain to fail the test of time., 3.0,  Leonard N, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977139986/, March 1 2018, N/A

 Was poorly written story. Adding force powers that causes me to wonder why don't they just make a Jedi army of the undead. Seriously who will win against a hundred Yoda's who can summon lightning. People will say well they can't do that all the time. My response please explain then when they can't or can because the movie just shows they can. Saying they can't because XYZ is putting headcannon to this. <br><br>The Luke skywalker Arc was disliked because we don't get to see why Luke became supposedly cowardly. Why did he fear Kylo? Was it because of the fight he had with Vader? Which he won was it because of the lightning he took from the Emperor. He watched the man die and it lasted for maybe 5 minutes which would then never happen to him again. Leading to him to do what we have learn the wise Jedi masters to do. Grow beyond the horror's in their pasts. Like Obi Wan not wanting to just run away and hide when he nearly died to Anakin and sensing the death of all the Jedi.<br><br>And the lack of any military knowledge is completely apparent in this film. I am really sadden by this. The First order could have just sent ships head though hyperspace. Why have to wait. Better yet why not just sent all their Tie fighters. It is shown they should have plenty? As the fan's we are made aware of the number of fighters carried by the First order and Empire being pretty numerous. But if the only care about victory I don't see why they would care if they lost a few. But better yet how would they lose any when they know the Resistance doesn't have any fighters left. We should be afraid of the first order yet they give us nothing to be afraid about.<br><br>These are just a few issues.

 Star wars the last jedi should have been called The last star wars- <br>to me this was the worst starwars of them all lets break it down- we hear that episodes 78 &amp 9 are bing made- wait 2 years only to see luke for 5 seconds and then wait another 2 years to see a depressing luke who has zero relationship with his past self. he is a guy who turned vader back to the light but in this case he decides to kill his nephew who has not turned- thats poor directing- thats not luke. The force projection was made up just for this movie-<br><br>Snoke- an amazing potential with this character only for him to die so early with no back story- we are left with poorly trained Kylo who isn't that powerful<br><br>the fin gambling area- why didn't Lando have a cameo here but more importantly why was this even in the film- should have killed Finn off he was boring<br>Rey: after we see in the lead up to episode 7 we have luke saying the force is strong in my family- My father had it- I had it my sister has it- you have that power to- he was speaking to rey he wasn't speaking to kylo- but now it appears theat rey is a nobody. the past 7 episodes were about family and the skywalkers- it seems that the director has gone through all the fan theories and write a story that made them all wrong- the problem is fan theories are from people who are fans - this show was no service to the star wars fan<br><br>I walked out of this starwars stunned depressed and sad. I waited 2 years for this pile of steaming Sh!t.<br><br>no lightsaber duels- I mean what the hell<br>no knights of ren story<br>Leia did a mary poppins <br>R2D2 was almost non existent<br>there was no team- all the characters are individuals - in the original you had han luke and chewie- in the prequals you had master and apprentice- in this they all do their own thing- theres no friendships no togetherness - no adventure and connection to the past 7 episodes- all the mysteries of episode 7 were basically chewed up and spat in our face.<br><br>so disappointed. a half star because it would not let me give zero. the worst starwars film to date (including caravan of courage) <br>I feel I was conned into buying sa ticket from reading the reviews from so called critics- they don't know what they are talking about, 0.5,  David W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/912199325/, March 1 2018, N/A

 (posting a second time with indented paragraphs)<br><br>Firstly I feel sorry for Rotten Tomatoes that they are so fearful of Disney that they have to falsify the percentages. I come back to the page day after day and that 48% refuses to budge while the negatives outweigh the positives at least 5 to 1 (and about half of the positive reviews look fake to me).<br><br>Thanks to all the reviewers who have posted their thoughts. Whether they were insightful amusing or crass they were all from the heart and I find myself coming here day after day to read the long ones. It gives me solace that I am not alone and I wish there was a like feature.<br><br>As bewildered as I was when I walked out of the cinema (twice) it took me a long time to fathom the 'why'. Why trash the most famous movie series of all time? Why burn bridges why ignore all the set ups from the previous movie why why why disgrace the Luke Skywalker character and alienate all the fans? Anyway I've finally got it.<br><br>The only way this movie makes any sense is if Disney tried to make a Star Wars movie for 8-year old girls. Frozen in a galaxy far far away. Frozen is the archetype as it is the only way it can make sense as a story pitch and also have gotten the green light from the studio.<br><br>I think Disney was so surprised by the success of Frozen and so sucked in by the Feminist publicity that they forgot that Frozen was a damn kids movie not a manifesto. Nevertheless they had the conceit to double down and remake Star Wars with all the (apparently?) contentious politically incorrect parts ripped out to simply to humiliate those dinosaur white middle aged fans.<br><br>So let's view this as Frozen in space. Everything naturally has to be dumbed right down (no harm in that if you are catering to a 8-year old I suppose). So the 'goodies' side is led by the heroine character (Rey) who has a mysterious past and can do anything (because Disney heroes are always 'special' and always have mysterious pasts). There are wise and kindly grandmother types (Leia Purple-haired Headmistress) strong but wise female offsiders (Rose and her sister) and of course cute animals with big eyes. Naturally - if Frozen is anything to go by - the male characters have to be 'baddies' because... girlpower?<br><br>Anyway every man is portrayed as foolish or reckless and stupid to boot. In short not to be trusted. Luke becomes the cantankerous old man only there as an obstacle to the heroine and Snoke is just the 'boss baddie' to be defeated and level up. No backstory needed! Catering to the pre-teen segment for a minute (Twilight) Kylo Ren is cast as the brooding 'bad boy' with a cute looks but dark past who is set up to inevitably (in episode 9) become the love interest and happily ever after. Way to go Disney!<br><br>This is the only way this movie makes any kind of sense. Which is why the movie is insulting to both the female and male audience.<br><br>If you want strong female characters look at Ripley or Vasquez from Aliens. Hermione and Ginny from Harry Potter. Take your pick! Women to be sure and proud of it. But strong because of who they are not what they are. I doubt even the most strident of Feminists would have been satisfied with the portrayal of women in this film.<br><br>Anyway enough of the backstory. Whatever the reason it got green lighted it's a stinker. Rotten to use this site's own words. It's a stinker not just as a movie (without the name Star Wars it would have bombed) but as a Star Wars movie it is a travesty and an insult. Rian Johnson ought to be ashamed of himself and if he can't see what we are all complaining about then he's a conceited fool as well as an incompetent writer.<br><br>A few comments:<br><br>The gravity bombs thing was stupid but we don't get so upset about gravity inside space ships and especially not the fact that sound doesn't travel in a vacuum. If they could have just made them bombs 'fall' like from the Tie Bomber in ESB we wouldn't be too upset.<br><br>Space ships running out of fuel was a contrived plot device and makes out the rebels to be completely incompetent as a fighting force. What kind of resistance force doesn't bring spare fuel and who schedules all the fuel tanks to run out at exactly the same time? Mind you the New Order aren't much better they don't have any ships that go very fast and they don't have the common sense to hyperspace ahead of the rebels. Oh and their turbo lasers don't work anymore.<br><br>There are so many things Luke could have done when presented with the lightsaber. Hold it in awe drop to his knees and weep throw it off the cliff in anger or held it to Rey's neck. The shoulder toss? Not in a million years.<br><br>I truly feel for Mark Hamill. He became as famous as one of the Beatles because of that role and in his triumphant return to acting he has to play the part of ...a jaded hobo? What a pro to go through with it but what a damn shame. <br><br>Which begs the question of WTF did they film that "my family had it and now you have it" part in the TFA trailers and then not use it? Did Disney really not have at least the bare bones of a story written for all three movies? Who runs a studio like that?<br><br>I didn't actually hate the Rose character. I think she'll end up being a fan favourite because there's a whole demographic out there with chubby Asian fetish (or maybe it's just me). It's just a pity that she wasn't given anything interesting to do and her only purpose was to give an emotional angle due to dead sister and incredibly convenient slave girl backstory. Oh and some moralizing "make love not war" comment which is pretty weird coming from a freedom fighter or should I say member of banned terrorist group.<br><br>What about the salt planet battle grand finale? Is that the best idea anyone could come up with? Why not Imperial Walkers climbing their way up a desolate mountain valley or Imperial Walkers emerging out of the water or Imperial Walkers coming over the rim of a crater on the moon? That would have made for an iconic and original setting. A salt planet that looks embarrassingly like Hoth? Originality be damned three cheers for you Disney.<br><br>BB8 was fun in TFA. Like a modern R2D2 and I liked that. But in this movie he (it?) turned into the equivalent of the Doctor's Sonic Screwdriver or Harry Potter's wand. A convenient plot device.<br><br>Lastly the humour (enough people have commented about Leia Emo Vader Rey and Yoda). It's not true that "Star Wars has always had humour". What Star Wars had was iconic lines that entered the lexicon. And by that I mean "Scruffy looking Nerf Herder" "Laugh it up fuzzball" or "You rebel Scum". <br><br>Those lines were not actually funny what they are is iconic and they fit the tone of the scene perfectly. That's why the prank call was stupid the Fin squirting water thing was stupid the chrome dome remark was stupid and the slot machine gun was stupid. Way to go Disney. What a bunch of willful incompetents.<br><br>Maybe they will invoke time travel in the next movie and find a way to write poor Carrie out of the script at the same time. As far as I am concerned this movie is non-canonical and I wish it had never been made., 0.5,  Dane W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976973055/, March 1 2018, N/A
 A complete and utter disappointment in every way. <br><br>Can I preface this by saying I *am* a SJW and all the SJW bashing in the comments is ridiculous. The movie didn't fail because it appealed to feminist and anti-racist ideals - and actually it didn't even do THAT to be honest. Finn and Rose were nothing but token sidekicks who had no major impact on the story in any way didn't have any good character development and were not inspirational to audiences. Rey's training and story were stripped away. She became just another "pretty white girl" on the screen. If anything it felt like the writers retreated to trying to develop Kylo Ren where it's safe. If "we" know anything it's angsty white guys. They tried to make him someone you could identify with instead of continuing the story from Force Awakens where he's really purely a villain. That was interesting. This was not. <br><br>I LOVED The Force Awakens. It was bold fresh Star Wars goodness with puppets and perfect cues and transitions excellent settings action and story and fantastic main characters. The characters had story drive and motivation. The humor was amazing I had so many moments of burst-out-loud laughter in that movie. There was none of that for me here. <br><br>Also though the movie as a whole was mostly complete and utter garbage start to finish the ONLY thing I LOVED was LEIA FLOATING THROUGH SPACE so STOP BASHING IT. She's had the Force for years surely she can move things a little???? With no gravity or resistance????? Luke never showed her anything? Of course he did. If you can accept Luke force projecting himself across lightyears with no prior explanation but can't accept Leia moving herself a bit through the vacuum of space I got nothin for ya :P <br><br>That said that decision to even bomb the bridge was ridiculous in the first place........ didn't... they have.... shields??? I was so confused when I saw that because the ship wasn't taking any damage but then suddenly the bridge did?????? WHAT????<br><br>THE PHYSICS IN THIS MOVIE IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. WHY ARE THERE "GRAVITY" STYLE SLOW MOVING BOMBERS IN SPACE<br><br>The entire opening act was just a disgrace of a military operation in film. Poe is supposedly the top pilot who makes decisions that get his entire bombing squadron destroyed??? REALLY??? This is so implausible it took me out of the movie right when it was beginning!<br><br>And yes why didn't everyone get sucked out into space when they opened the door for Leia. <br><br>I didn't care anything about Rose and I wanted to care. They made a preachy token out of her too with her stiff speech about equality in the middle of the film. Why do we have any reason to care? <br><br>So many opportunities to do something truly awesome were missed in this film (hello Force spirit Han Solo???? Please????) Rey was reduced to an observer. What did she do in the film that was actually of any import? Finn and Rose failed at their (ridiculous side mission that somehow took the majority of the movie) plan. Snoke's death felt like a cowardly out by the writers afraid to actually do something with the chess piece on the board they'll just nuke it. <br><br>This film has no redeeming qualities. Rey and Kylo's battle was ruined by the conclusion. <br><br>Would it have saved the film for me if Rey decided to turn sides against her friends and join Kylo on the Dark Side? Absolutely. The film sets up this stunner then drops it like a rock. THAT would have been bold and new and interesting. The option was presented and we got nothing. So there was no point to her even being there. <br><br>Luke's appearance near the end of the film was a total and utter letdown. So many people have already gone into how they betrayed his character - and I find it so incredibly hard to believe he would have lost it over a few Dark Side thoughts from his NEPHEW. BTW THAT'S YOUR NEPHEW LUKE HE SHARES YOUR BLOOD but I digress. The way the epic moment at the end of The Force Awakens was completely abandoned at the beginning of The Last Jedi with that inane lightsaber toss over the shoulder... Rian Johnson the director clearly DOESN'T understand what it takes to make an EPIC. Like the original Star Wars like Lord of the Rings like the Matrix (1999). You don't DROP a moment like that! Ever! That would be like Aragorn shrugging his shoulders at the end of The Return of the King and walking away from the gates instead of turning the fight. The Hell Johnson??? It's like he's never seen another movie in his life and somehow got pegged to helm this one. <br><br>Finn!! My heart!! I would have loved to go deeper into Finn but somehow he ended up being the Trademark Coward (???) which seemed like a gross misinterpretation of who he was in The Force Awakens. <br><br>And Admiral Holdo was a total disgrace as a leader. When the mutiny happened they should have ran with that instead of deciding "Oh wait actually she was right somehow." The "feminist" angle about her doesn't bother me at all and it's great to see women in power with funky hairstyles. It was absolutely ridiculous that she couldn't lead for sh*t and that the movie didn't allow the younger characters to depose her. What happened to "destroy all the old"??? There you go she's the old let her go! Instead she got "redeemed" and that was really a disgusting moment for me. <br><br>I'm so disappointed with the handling of this film. Started off so well with TFA and could have been SO much better than that one as well. It even sets up a few awesome points for itself but then drops them completely. For all the fear we've had of directors fudging up their moments at an epic helm that didn't come to fruition Rian Johnson truly took each and every one of those darkest fears and brought them fully into reality in the worst ways imaginable. As the film's runner Johnson seemed to care nothing about the awesome new characters or the legacy of Star Wars. I'd be perfectly happy to see him rewarded for this monumental failure with a complete blacklist from film., 1.0,  Private U, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/794875571/, March 1 2018, N/A

 The bad humor (can you hear me now?) the disregard for plot elements from "The Force Awakens" the mistreatment of long standing fan favorite characters (Chewbacca R2-D2 etc.) the disregard for ESTABLISHED LORE the plot elements used in the film the focus for underlying political tones...<br><br>I can't and won't rate this movie higher than I'd rate Phantom Menace- a movie which I USED TO consider the worst in the Star Wars universe. The worst movie in the Star Wars episodic universe now goes to "The Last Jedi"- something I thought could never happen starring Luke Skywalker Chewbacca Princess Leia C3PO and R2-D2.<br><br>Aside from production values and certain moments the story just isn't good.

 I never even remotely entertained the idea I would ever leave a bad review for a Star Wars movie in my lifetime but here I am and here it is.<br> <br> I have only one fervent hope for this review that someone anyone from Disney reads this and optimistic fool that I am realises that what they have done with this film is wrong not just a point of view not just another plebs opinion but outright egregiously wrong. <br><br> If anyone reading thinks that I'm a bot or whatever technological scape goat all these bad customer reviews have been blamed on then just stop reading because you're probably the kind of brainwashed trend sucking dilettante who swallowed this "entertainment" in the first place.<br><br> You may notice I used the word customer above might sound strange but that's what I was Disney's customer quite happy with my purchase of The Force Awakens and Rogue One never expecting when I paid my £19.95 back in December what I was buying at that IMAX showing. My purchase consisted quite truthfully of one of the most dispiriting nihilistic and frankly upsetting experiences I have ever had in the cinema.<br><br> I was on your side Disney I was with you I enjoyed the previous two films and was looking forward to this one but you've lost me you spent two and half hours going out of your way to tell me you don't want my enthusiasm for this property anymore and presumably you definitely don't want my money either?<br><br> I don't like having strong political points of view thrust upon me be they right or left wing when simply trying to enjoy a piece of escapist entertainment lets be adults here this film was pushing a very obvious agenda and it was overkill and it's ruined the movie end of. There's no arguing it didn't there's no other point of view here it destroyed it it's inarguably pissed off the fan base and if numbers are to be believed it's not done much for the films takings. It's lecturing was obvious unwelcome and amateurishly misjudged. The irony is I personally agree with some of the "issues" that were alluded to but when it's so lazily inserted into the piece as it was here to the point that I felt like I was being spoken to like a special needs child it just serves to get peoples backs up. I'm frankly astonished this would need explaining to anyone who's been in the entertaining people business as long as Disney. <br><br> I could type all night and not come remotely close to describing my utter dismay at the contemptuous treatment of the character Luke Skywalker. Dear God where to even begin three films three BLOODY films to train to sacrifice to risk all to become a Jedi to redeem the unredeemable to topple an evil dictatorship to restore peace and justice to an entire galaxy. Then when confronted with a possible repeat of his fathers flaws in his nephew I as a grown reasonably intelligent adult am supposed to accept that individual who suffered and matured through so much would posit the plan "right I'll sneak in when he's asleep and lop his head off and blame it on the Vikings"!<br><br> I don't need to say anymore do I because any living human being with any cognitive ability would read that and think no that just doesn't work it just doesn't. But why would they do this why would Luke be cast in this light because his character as it always had been is not considered a palatable character by the modern zeitgeist just as Han was cast as the dead beat dad in the previous episode Luke is viewed as too good too perfect too virtuous and therefore at odds with the "y'know the original trilogy really isn't that good kids" agenda that these films are clearly pursuing. Yet the ultimate irony is that the character of Rey is all these things and more such a CHRONIC Mary Sue is she that with the at best marginal threat the new Empire seem to pose to her she already has them hog tied and branded and has moved on to reasoning the meaning of life and explaining to God where he's slipped up in the past as well. <br><br> When you have no confidence or true conviction in your capacity to produce an entertainment of equal or superior quality to the ones that preceded it you don't try to undermine what went before. You don't try to devalue what was achieved in the story in those previous entries you don't bring back beloved actors in their most iconic roles just to dispatch them with such implied disdain that it actually makes me physically wince to contemplate it. <br><br>UNLESS unless your intent is to purposely alienate admirers of the original films and if that is the case then well done Lucasfilm/ Disney you have won you made a perfect movie to achieve those ends. No more support no more money no more interest shall I ever squander on your output I swear as my fingers type this we are done. For every beloved memory of viewing the original trilogy for every behind the scenes Christmas special for every dodgy Atari 2600 game I played for every warm memory of endless dramas played out with 3 3/4 inch figures for every cherished golden life affirming experience REAL Star Wars has ever bestowed upon my life I REJECT you and your PC lectures your inappropriate humour your character assassination I shun you I consign you to the wasteland of modern popular cinema to wither and die in the neglect of younger more fickle generations you deserve them and they deserve you.<br><br> Goodbye Star Wars go forth and multiply Disney., 1.0,  Paul W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977142603/, March 1 2018, N/A
 Let's get the positives out of the way and the reason it doesn't deserve the lowest score : The visuals are spectacular there is excellent cinematography the music is outstanding.<br><br>Let's now focus on why it's only a 2/5 : The writing for this movie is absolutely awful. It is filled with lazy writing plot holes and nonsensical moments. All the existing characters got ruined the new ones were awful. "Nothing" is the best word to describe what we get. A boring side story that should be a filler episode for a TV-show that results in nothing. Rey's parents were no one. Snoke is nothing. <br><br>This movie is great for people who like nice visuals. It's an insult for any Star Wars fan and an insult for anyone who enjoys good story telling., 2.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977142552/, March 1 2018, N/A

 FU Rian Jackoff. FU Kathleen Feminazi. FU First Order(Disney). <br><br>You treasonous scumbags just killed the childhoods and memories of millions of faithful Star Wars fans with this SJW feminist and racist agenda.<br><br>Plenty of others went into the details of how you dirtbags pulled this off in one film so I won't get into it. I'll use this space to write about something that this movie is severely lacking in order to even qualify as a watchable flick.<br><br>Every movie has a climax or an landmark scene that distinguishes the movie. Action movies Comedies Dramas Horror movies Adventure flicks even kid movies always have them. I'll explain. A climax is where something profound takes place. This could be an intense action scene with lots of special effects where the good guys and bad guys fight (Any action flick). It could be where the detective discovers who the real killer is (Every crime movie). It could be where the happy character realizes that sadness plays an important role (Inside Out). Finding out Bruce Willis is a ghost (Sixth Sense). Every Star Wars movie has a climax or a very memorable/cool scene.<br><br>Luke blowing up the Death Star with Han's help.<br><br>"I am your father" in ESB.<br><br>Vader picking up the emperor and throwing him.<br><br>Obi wan flipping over Maul and slicing him in half<br><br>Yoda fighting Dooku <br><br>"I have the high ground" - Obi wan or Yoda fighting the emperor<br><br><br>The Last Jerkoff did not have a memorable scene or a climax at all. Luke dodging a lightsaber!!!??? Rey lifting rocks!!!???? Rose sexually molesting Fin!!!??? Where is the climax?????<br><br>When a movie has a good climax I would rewatch movies just to enjoy it again. I would sometimes pop the movie in just to watch certain scenes specifically the climax. The Last Dumpsterfire has no scenes that make me want to rewatch the movie ever again.<br><br>So not only did they betray the entire Star Wars fanbase they made a shit film that has no scenes that even remotely try to be re-watchable. Rian Jackoff has to be the worst writer/director on the planet. JJ is far from perfect. Force Awakens was not a great Star Wars film but it was not horrible either. Regardless JJ set Jackoff up with Star Wars on a golden platter. Jackoff took the golden platter pulled down his pants and shit all over the platter. He then took the platter around to his feminist sycophantic suckups and fed them his shit off the platter while they smile and enjoy it. Again FU Rian Jackoff. FU Kathleen Feminazi. FU Disney. You earned this one star rating. Your 90% critic score is only because Disney paid off the right people., 1.0,  Chris M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976980641/, March 1 2018, N/A
