 This film is great in all of the following things: Acting visuals score costume design and screenplay. But all of that is ruined by J.J. Abrams lack of storytelling. No originality whatsoever it literally copied everything from Episode 4. At least Episode 1 as terrible as it was had an original story. But still Force Awakens offers up a good amount of action and comedy to make it a very good movie., 3.5,  Smith T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977170552/, March 19 2018, N/A

 Reviewed 12.14.17. Another Death Star? Really another darn Death Star? The lack of originality in the script would be enough alone to sink most movies. Yet it survives and dare I say even thrives. Why? A combination of deep nostalgia and excellent pacing. For every moment where I cringed (hokey usage of previous Star War's lines implausible relocation of characters from frame to frame and oh did I mention a THIRD DEATH STAR?!) there was something funny or amusing. For a viewer new to the series it might not resonate.

 Don't have a clue how it has been rated so high. The movie seemed very slapped together with terrible actor choices for characters. Nothing against Adam Driver but when he removed his mask as Kylo Renn I literally could not stop laughing dude looks much more like a Geek Squad member than a sith lord. Also an example of the plot being slapped together is how Rey somehow is a badass overnight when in the past we see Luke Skywalker and even the badass Darth Vader spent years mastering their skills and abilities.

 Capturing the old Star Wars vibe cantina and all this movie continues the saga with an amazing start. Rey played by Daisy Ridley steals the show in this film followed in a close second by Harrison Ford's Han Solo the same as ever. Adam Driver and John Boyega also deliver some good performances as side characters in the movie but they play their roles very well. Oscaar Isaac has a very small role in this and while it is small he is very noteworthy in those moments. I highly recommend this movie to any Star Wars fan and casual movie goer., 4.0,  Josh K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/931853787/, March 16 2018, N/A

 Where do I begin? For one I don't like any Star Wars at all. Unfortunately my wife is a huge fan so I have seen all of them. But the one movie that stood out from all was this The Force Awakens. It starts out with a brand-new droid who is supposed to be cute but is really just two spheres stacked up on each other. Kylo-Ren isn't a good villian. That is one god-ugly mask he has and. Kylo-Ren's ugly pale face is supposed to look evil. He looks like a nerd before a math test. And then as we learn in The Last Jedi he survived! Rey practically chopped off every body part he had. Now lets start with Rey. I mean I get the girl power stuff and everything. I get that a strong female character is what you should promote in a male-dominate country like the U.S.A (cough cough no female president. we elect cheese puffs instead.) But seriously? Flying the Millenium Falcon with no training? Beating a experienced fighter like Kylo-Ren on your first try lightsabering? I'm sorry but thats taking it a wee bit to far. Then there is Han Solo. I know that was supposed to make you cry because you know he commited patricide and its frickin' Han Solo. I was mad. Han Solo is the greatest Star Wars character of all time (behind Darth Vader of course!) and you just plain kill him off like THAT! He did NOTHING heroic he didn't even hold a lightsaber until Kylo-Ren stuck it through his chest. Then there's Finn. I understand Star Wars need to have a black guy in their movies because most characters are middle-aged white guys like our favorite character Kylo-Ren! But honestly Finn just dosen't have that many action moments and isn't that great a character. Then there is Po. Po has a huge ego as is confirmed in The Last Jedi. My impression of him is this: "Hi I'm Po. I'm better than all of you. I should be commander because I'm a white middle-aged guy.". As a bonus he has BB-8 on his ship beeping in a vaugely happy or scared way! And as unrealistic as ever the laser beams magically hit all the ships but Po's! Po swoops in for and unrealistic blowing up of Starkiller Base. Oh I'm sorry you said you needed a BIGGER Death Star. Come on J.J. Abrams. Star Wars is worth like a billion dollars. You can afford to buy a better idea then a bigger Death Star. And then they're trying to find that missing puzzle piece to find none other than... LUKE SKYWALKER!!! They find him Rey gives him the lightsaber and the movie ends. They magically blow up Starkiller Base and coincidentally they also find the last puzzle piece!<br>Now if you don't agree with me screw you. I hated this movie and I urge you to join me to hate The Force Awakens. People who hate the Last Jedi I'm with you 100%. I hate the Last Jedi. I wrote a rant for that too. But I am so sorry The Force Awakens is THE WORST movie of all time., 0.5,  Hamilton R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977165094/, March 14 2018, N/A

 The Force Awakens is a welcome return to the lived-in universe of the well-loved original trilogy. The characters are engaging the visuals are stunning and the story adeptly balances the old and the new. However the film suffers from a rehashed plot that lifts elements from A New Hope and essentially recrafts them sometimes to a fault. Though derivative TFA's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. The film manages even in the face of unprecedented hype to recapture the boundless energy that embodied the originals and was so lacking in the prequels. The Force has awakened and it's here to stay., 3.5,  Scott M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/972643831/, March 13 2018, N/A
 It has been a few years since this abomination came out. But I recently wrote a review for TLJ and I am probably going to write a review for the other SW films. But this one in particular is a horrid excuse for a film. <br><br>I will explain. First this nothing but a rehash of episode 4. But more creatively bankrupt and disgusting. And it irritates me to no end when I see/n the "apologists" for this crap over the years. The excuses that pour out of these morons are putrid! Like<br><br>"they needed to rehash it because they wanted to bring fans back that didn't like the prequels!"<br>"It needed to be done to show that SW can be exciting!" <br>"they needed to reboot it for the newer generations benefit!" <br><br><br>Even Jar Jar Abrams has admitted to rehashing it. So he basically said the he had to "play it safe" to get fans back. Uh...NO! When I see morons say how they had to "play it safe" they are just admitting that they love laziness and used ideas. Well you got another OT now you whiny rejects. Are you happy with the same crap over and over? Never mind you are! And when or if episode 10 rolls around I am very positive that they will have another trilogy of rebels vs the mighty empire. Because it is obvious that all these morons want is more of the same. <br><br>I could go on but my point is that the "apologists" bend over backwards to excuse laziness. The only obligation they had to do was to make a sequel to ROTJ. But the idiots that enjoy this drivel like being patronized by a corporate entity. They basically tried to "buy" fans back by giving them reheated left overs and calling it "new." These people who bought into it are pathetic! <br><br>Disney and LFL basically were selling the new generation used experiences. Like "hey kids? Do you want to feel the way your parents felt when the first seen SW?" This is basically robbing the newer generation of their OWN authentic experiences. That is pretty low. But since Disney and LFL apparently have no balls they just gave the world the OT 2.0. And the idiots just fell in love with the same old stuff. Some for the first time and some for the second time. With how TLJ came out they don't really do original all too well. <br><br><br>But the biggest issue for me was how they treated the force in this. MaRey Sue uses the force with 0 training. That is right. 0 training! I did pay attention to the film though. As many who claim to "love" it have not. Because it took me all but one line of dialogue to figure this out. <br><br>Kylo Ren to Snoke: She is UNTRAINED! But stronger then she knows! <br><br>See? One line of dialogue. Did that stop all the "Reytards" from wasting 2 years thinking up every excuse to try to explain how she did what she did? Nope. I had to argue for those 2 years telling these cretins that she was untrained . If they actually paid attention they wouldn't have made themselves look like tools making excuses when it was spelled out for them in the film. <br><br><br>And nice what they did to Han eh? He went back to being a smuggler. But he also became a dead beat dad too! Then killed by his own son. After knowing his son had "too much Vader" in him Han tries to talk him into coming home like he was a 10 year old that was mad because he didn't want to leave the arcade. But Han knew he wasn't coming home and I guess he got what he knew he would get. <br><br><br>And then General Leia. She was a general in the OT and also in the ST. Now that is character development right there.../S<br><br><br>Finn is the worst character in the SW universe. Well he is tied with Rose now. But in TFA he basically gets shell shock on his first mission without even firing a shot. And then he wants to run from the FO because?...Reasons? I guess this is where the new books have to be taken into account. That is what the fans of this drek seem to tell you when something doesn't get explained. You basically need a manual to watch a movie now with these new ones. I know he didn't want to kill for the FO anymore. Not that he ever did in the first place. Because Jakku was his first mission. But he will kill for anyone else without thinking twice. <br><br><br>Then we have Maz. She was the one in all her infinite wisdom to yell out "HAN SOLO!" in a crowded bar knowing he has a a price on his head and also brings BB-8 with him knowing the FO is looking for it. But back to Maz. When they are sitting at the table talking she tells all of them that they must fight the FO! Then the FO brings the fight to her doorstep. And where is big game talking Maz? Oh yeah she is hiding away somewhere. <br><br><br>But this has been long enough already. I am pretty bored just thinking about TFA. Garbage movie for garbage lovers! Oh and these new Disney movies are made for the "Veruca Salt" generation. The "I want it now" ones.<br><br>"Real sets! Practical and tangible sets"...Blah blah blah! It is hillariious how some morons bought into this. TFA was a CGI fest covered turd and the idiots bought it. Disney and co. lied to your faces! They basically bent you over and had their way with you and since you are drones you took it all and asked for seconds. SMFH... So how did all that "going back to the old school" BS work out for ya? I bet you are feeling mighty stupid right about now? Disney will keep on lying and the morons will keep buyin'!, 1.0,  Gabber C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977088517/, March 13 2018, N/A

 This film is great in all of the following things: Acting visuals score costume design and screenplay. But all of that is ruined by J.J. Abrams lack of storytelling.

 Don't have a clue how it has been rated so high. The movie seemed very slapped together with terrible actor choices for characters. Nothing against Adam Driver but when he removed his mask as Kylo Renn I literally could not stop laughing dude looks much more like a Geek Squad member than a sith lord. Also an example of the plot being slapped together is how Rey somehow is a badass overnight when in the past we see Luke Skywalker and even the badass Darth Vader spent years mastering their skills and abilities.

 Capturing the old Star Wars vibe cantina and all this movie continues the saga with an amazing start. Rey played by Daisy Ridley steals the show in this film followed in a close second by Harrison Ford's Han Solo the same as ever. Adam Driver and John Boyega also deliver some good performances as side characters in the movie but they play their roles very well. Oscaar Isaac has a very small role in this and while it is small he is very noteworthy in those moments.

 Where do I begin? For one I don't like any Star Wars at all. Unfortunately my wife is a huge fan so I have seen all of them. But the one movie that stood out from all was this The Force Awakens. It starts out with a brand-new droid who is supposed to be cute but is really just two spheres stacked up on each other. Kylo-Ren isn't a good villian. That is one god-ugly mask he has and. Kylo-Ren's ugly pale face is supposed to look evil. He looks like a nerd before a math test. And then as we learn in The Last Jedi he survived! Rey practically chopped off every body part he had. Now lets start with Rey. I mean I get the girl power stuff and everything. I get that a strong female character is what you should promote in a male-dominate country like the U.S.A (cough cough no female president. we elect cheese puffs instead.) But seriously? Flying the Millenium Falcon with no training? Beating a experienced fighter like Kylo-Ren on your first try lightsabering? I'm sorry but thats taking it a wee bit to far. Then there is Han Solo. I know that was supposed to make you cry because you know he commited patricide and its frickin' Han Solo. I was mad. Han Solo is the greatest Star Wars character of all time (behind Darth Vader of course!) and you just plain kill him off like THAT! He did NOTHING heroic he didn't even hold a lightsaber until Kylo-Ren stuck it through his chest. Then there's Finn. I understand Star Wars need to have a black guy in their movies because most characters are middle-aged white guys like our favorite character Kylo-Ren! But honestly Finn just dosen't have that many action moments and isn't that great a character. Then there is Po. Po has a huge ego as is confirmed in The Last Jedi. My impression of him is this: "Hi I'm Po. I'm better than all of you. I should be commander because I'm a white middle-aged guy.". As a bonus he has BB-8 on his ship beeping in a vaugely happy or scared way! And as unrealistic as ever the laser beams magically hit all the ships but Po's! Po swoops in for and unrealistic blowing up of Starkiller Base. Oh I'm sorry you said you needed a BIGGER Death Star. Come on J.J. Abrams. Star Wars is worth like a billion dollars. You can afford to buy a better idea then a bigger Death Star. And then they're trying to find that missing puzzle piece to find none other than... LUKE SKYWALKER!!! They find him Rey gives him the lightsaber and the movie ends. They magically blow up Starkiller Base and coincidentally they also find the last puzzle piece!<br>Now if you don't agree with me screw you. I hated this movie and I urge you to join me to hate The Force Awakens. People who hate the Last Jedi I'm with you 100%. I hate the Last Jedi. I wrote a rant for that too. But I am so sorry The Force Awakens is THE WORST movie of all time., 0.5,  Hamilton R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977165094/, March 14 2018, N/A

 The Force Awakens is a welcome return to the lived-in universe of the well-loved original trilogy. The characters are engaging the visuals are stunning and the story adeptly balances the old and the new. However the film suffers from a rehashed plot that lifts elements from A New Hope and essentially recrafts them sometimes to a fault. Though derivative TFA's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. The film manages even in the face of unprecedented hype to recapture the boundless energy that embodied the originals and was so lacking in the prequels. The Force has awakened and it's here to stay., 3.5,  Scott M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/972643831/, March 13 2018, N/A
 It has been a few years since this abomination came out. But I recently wrote a review for TLJ and I am probably going to write a review for the other SW films. But this one in particular is a horrid excuse for a film. <br><br>I will explain. First this nothing but a rehash of episode 4. But more creatively bankrupt and disgusting. And it irritates me to no end when I see/n the "apologists" for this crap over the years. The excuses that pour out of these morons are putrid! Like<br><br>"they needed to rehash it because they wanted to bring fans back that didn't like the prequels!"<br>"It needed to be done to show that SW can be exciting!" <br>"they needed to reboot it for the newer generations benefit!" <br><br><br>Even Jar Jar Abrams has admitted to rehashing it. So he basically said the he had to "play it safe" to get fans back. Uh...NO! When I see morons say how they had to "play it safe" they are just admitting that they love laziness and used ideas. Well you got another OT now you whiny rejects. Are you happy with the same crap over and over? Never mind you are! And when or if episode 10 rolls around I am very positive that they will have another trilogy of rebels vs the mighty empire. Because it is obvious that all these morons want is more of the same. <br><br>I could go on but my point is that the "apologists" bend over backwards to excuse laziness. The only obligation they had to do was to make a sequel to ROTJ. But the idiots that enjoy this drivel like being patronized by a corporate entity. They basically tried to "buy" fans back by giving them reheated left overs and calling it "new." These people who bought into it are pathetic! <br><br>Disney and LFL basically were selling the new generation used experiences. Like "hey kids? Do you want to feel the way your parents felt when the first seen SW?" This is basically robbing the newer generation of their OWN authentic experiences. That is pretty low. But since Disney and LFL apparently have no balls they just gave the world the OT 2.0. And the idiots just fell in love with the same old stuff. Some for the first time and some for the second time. With how TLJ came out they don't really do original all too well. <br><br><br>But the biggest issue for me was how they treated the force in this. MaRey Sue uses the force with 0 training. That is right. 0 training! I did pay attention to the film though. As many who claim to "love" it have not. Because it took me all but one line of dialogue to figure this out. <br><br>Kylo Ren to Snoke: She is UNTRAINED! But stronger then she knows! <br><br>See? One line of dialogue. Did that stop all the "Reytards" from wasting 2 years thinking up every excuse to try to explain how she did what she did? Nope. I had to argue for those 2 years telling these cretins that she was untrained . If they actually paid attention they wouldn't have made themselves look like tools making excuses when it was spelled out for them in the film. <br><br><br>And nice what they did to Han eh? He went back to being a smuggler. But he also became a dead beat dad too! Then killed by his own son. After knowing his son had "too much Vader" in him Han tries to talk him into coming home like he was a 10 year old that was mad because he didn't want to leave the arcade. But Han knew he wasn't coming home and I guess he got what he knew he would get. <br><br><br>And then General Leia. She was a general in the OT and also in the ST. Now that is character development right there.../S<br><br><br>Finn is the worst character in the SW universe. Well he is tied with Rose now. But in TFA he basically gets shell shock on his first mission without even firing a shot. And then he wants to run from the FO because?...Reasons? I guess this is where the new books have to be taken into account. That is what the fans of this drek seem to tell you when something doesn't get explained. You basically need a manual to watch a movie now with these new ones. I know he didn't want to kill for the FO anymore. Not that he ever did in the first place. Because Jakku was his first mission. But he will kill for anyone else without thinking twice. <br><br><br>Then we have Maz. She was the one in all her infinite wisdom to yell out "HAN SOLO!" in a crowded bar knowing he has a a price on his head and also brings BB-8 with him knowing the FO is looking for it. But back to Maz. When they are sitting at the table talking she tells all of them that they must fight the FO! Then the FO brings the fight to her doorstep. And where is big game talking Maz? Oh yeah she is hiding away somewhere. <br><br><br>But this has been long enough already. I am pretty bored just thinking about TFA. Garbage movie for garbage lovers! Oh and these new Disney movies are made for the "Veruca Salt" generation. The "I want it now" ones.<br><br>"Real sets! Practical and tangible sets"...Blah blah blah! It is hillariious how some morons bought into this. TFA was a CGI fest covered turd and the idiots bought it. Disney and co. lied to your faces! They basically bent you over and had their way with you and since you are drones you took it all and asked for seconds. SMFH... So how did all that "going back to the old school" BS work out for ya?

 This film is great in all of the following things: Acting visuals score costume design and screenplay. But all of that is ruined by J.J. Abrams lack of storytelling.

 Don't have a clue how it has been rated so high. The movie seemed very slapped together with terrible actor choices for characters. Nothing against Adam Driver but when he removed his mask as Kylo Renn I literally could not stop laughing dude looks much more like a Geek Squad member than a sith lord. Also an example of the plot being slapped together is how Rey somehow is a badass overnight when in the past we see Luke Skywalker and even the badass Darth Vader spent years mastering their skills and abilities.

 Capturing the old Star Wars vibe cantina and all this movie continues the saga with an amazing start. Rey played by Daisy Ridley steals the show in this film followed in a close second by Harrison Ford's Han Solo the same as ever. Adam Driver and John Boyega also deliver some good performances as side characters in the movie but they play their roles very well. Oscaar Isaac has a very small role in this and while it is small he is very noteworthy in those moments.

 Where do I begin? For one I don't like any Star Wars at all. Unfortunately my wife is a huge fan so I have seen all of them. But the one movie that stood out from all was this The Force Awakens. It starts out with a brand-new droid who is supposed to be cute but is really just two spheres stacked up on each other. Kylo-Ren isn't a good villian. That is one god-ugly mask he has and. Kylo-Ren's ugly pale face is supposed to look evil. He looks like a nerd before a math test. And then as we learn in The Last Jedi he survived! Rey practically chopped off every body part he had. Now lets start with Rey. I mean I get the girl power stuff and everything. I get that a strong female character is what you should promote in a male-dominate country like the U.S.A (cough cough no female president. we elect cheese puffs instead.) But seriously? Flying the Millenium Falcon with no training? Beating a experienced fighter like Kylo-Ren on your first try lightsabering? I'm sorry but thats taking it a wee bit to far. Then there is Han Solo. I know that was supposed to make you cry because you know he commited patricide and its frickin' Han Solo. I was mad. Han Solo is the greatest Star Wars character of all time (behind Darth Vader of course!) and you just plain kill him off like THAT! He did NOTHING heroic he didn't even hold a lightsaber until Kylo-Ren stuck it through his chest. Then there's Finn. I understand Star Wars need to have a black guy in their movies because most characters are middle-aged white guys like our favorite character Kylo-Ren! But honestly Finn just dosen't have that many action moments and isn't that great a character. Then there is Po. Po has a huge ego as is confirmed in The Last Jedi. My impression of him is this: "Hi I'm Po. I'm better than all of you. I should be commander because I'm a white middle-aged guy.". As a bonus he has BB-8 on his ship beeping in a vaugely happy or scared way! And as unrealistic as ever the laser beams magically hit all the ships but Po's! Po swoops in for and unrealistic blowing up of Starkiller Base. Oh I'm sorry you said you needed a BIGGER Death Star. Come on J.J. Abrams. Star Wars is worth like a billion dollars. You can afford to buy a better idea then a bigger Death Star. And then they're trying to find that missing puzzle piece to find none other than... LUKE SKYWALKER!!! They find him Rey gives him the lightsaber and the movie ends. They magically blow up Starkiller Base and coincidentally they also find the last puzzle piece!<br>Now if you don't agree with me screw you. I hated this movie and I urge you to join me to hate The Force Awakens. People who hate the Last Jedi I'm with you 100%. I hate the Last Jedi. I wrote a rant for that too. But I am so sorry The Force Awakens is THE WORST movie of all time., 0.5,  Hamilton R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977165094/, March 14 2018, N/A

 The Force Awakens is a welcome return to the lived-in universe of the well-loved original trilogy. The characters are engaging the visuals are stunning and the story adeptly balances the old and the new. However the film suffers from a rehashed plot that lifts elements from A New Hope and essentially recrafts them sometimes to a fault. Though derivative TFA's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. The film manages even in the face of unprecedented hype to recapture the boundless energy that embodied the originals and was so lacking in the prequels. The Force has awakened and it's here to stay., 3.5,  Scott M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/972643831/, March 13 2018, N/A
 It has been a few years since this abomination came out. But I recently wrote a review for TLJ and I am probably going to write a review for the other SW films. But this one in particular is a horrid excuse for a film. <br><br>I will explain. First this nothing but a rehash of episode 4. But more creatively bankrupt and disgusting. And it irritates me to no end when I see/n the "apologists" for this crap over the years. The excuses that pour out of these morons are putrid! Like<br><br>"they needed to rehash it because they wanted to bring fans back that didn't like the prequels!"<br>"It needed to be done to show that SW can be exciting!" <br>"they needed to reboot it for the newer generations benefit!" <br><br><br>Even Jar Jar Abrams has admitted to rehashing it. So he basically said the he had to "play it safe" to get fans back. Uh...NO! When I see morons say how they had to "play it safe" they are just admitting that they love laziness and used ideas. Well you got another OT now you whiny rejects. Are you happy with the same crap over and over? Never mind you are! And when or if episode 10 rolls around I am very positive that they will have another trilogy of rebels vs the mighty empire. Because it is obvious that all these morons want is more of the same. <br><br>I could go on but my point is that the "apologists" bend over backwards to excuse laziness. The only obligation they had to do was to make a sequel to ROTJ. But the idiots that enjoy this drivel like being patronized by a corporate entity. They basically tried to "buy" fans back by giving them reheated left overs and calling it "new." These people who bought into it are pathetic! <br><br>Disney and LFL basically were selling the new generation used experiences. Like "hey kids? Do you want to feel the way your parents felt when the first seen SW?" This is basically robbing the newer generation of their OWN authentic experiences. That is pretty low. But since Disney and LFL apparently have no balls they just gave the world the OT 2.0. And the idiots just fell in love with the same old stuff. Some for the first time and some for the second time. With how TLJ came out they don't really do original all too well. <br><br><br>But the biggest issue for me was how they treated the force in this. MaRey Sue uses the force with 0 training. That is right. 0 training! I did pay attention to the film though. As many who claim to "love" it have not. Because it took me all but one line of dialogue to figure this out. <br><br>Kylo Ren to Snoke: She is UNTRAINED! But stronger then she knows! <br><br>See? One line of dialogue. Did that stop all the "Reytards" from wasting 2 years thinking up every excuse to try to explain how she did what she did? Nope. I had to argue for those 2 years telling these cretins that she was untrained . If they actually paid attention they wouldn't have made themselves look like tools making excuses when it was spelled out for them in the film. <br><br><br>And nice what they did to Han eh? He went back to being a smuggler. But he also became a dead beat dad too! Then killed by his own son. After knowing his son had "too much Vader" in him Han tries to talk him into coming home like he was a 10 year old that was mad because he didn't want to leave the arcade. But Han knew he wasn't coming home and I guess he got what he knew he would get. <br><br><br>And then General Leia. She was a general in the OT and also in the ST. Now that is character development right there.../S<br><br><br>Finn is the worst character in the SW universe. Well he is tied with Rose now. But in TFA he basically gets shell shock on his first mission without even firing a shot. And then he wants to run from the FO because?...Reasons? I guess this is where the new books have to be taken into account. That is what the fans of this drek seem to tell you when something doesn't get explained. You basically need a manual to watch a movie now with these new ones. I know he didn't want to kill for the FO anymore. Not that he ever did in the first place. Because Jakku was his first mission. But he will kill for anyone else without thinking twice. <br><br><br>Then we have Maz. She was the one in all her infinite wisdom to yell out "HAN SOLO!" in a crowded bar knowing he has a a price on his head and also brings BB-8 with him knowing the FO is looking for it. But back to Maz. When they are sitting at the table talking she tells all of them that they must fight the FO! Then the FO brings the fight to her doorstep. And where is big game talking Maz? Oh yeah she is hiding away somewhere. <br><br><br>But this has been long enough already. I am pretty bored just thinking about TFA. Garbage movie for garbage lovers!

 This film is great in all of the following things: Acting visuals score costume design and screenplay. But all of that is ruined by J.J. Abrams lack of storytelling.

 Capturing the old Star Wars vibe cantina and all this movie continues the saga with an amazing start. Rey played by Daisy Ridley steals the show in this film followed in a close second by Harrison Ford's Han Solo the same as ever. Adam Driver and John Boyega also deliver some good performances as side characters in the movie but they play their roles very well. Oscaar Isaac has a very small role in this and while it is small he is very noteworthy in those moments.

 Where do I begin? For one I don't like any Star Wars at all. Unfortunately my wife is a huge fan so I have seen all of them. But the one movie that stood out from all was this The Force Awakens. It starts out with a brand-new droid who is supposed to be cute but is really just two spheres stacked up on each other. Kylo-Ren isn't a good villian. That is one god-ugly mask he has and. Kylo-Ren's ugly pale face is supposed to look evil. He looks like a nerd before a math test. And then as we learn in The Last Jedi he survived! Rey practically chopped off every body part he had. Now lets start with Rey. I mean I get the girl power stuff and everything. I get that a strong female character is what you should promote in a male-dominate country like the U.S.A (cough cough no female president. we elect cheese puffs instead.) But seriously? Flying the Millenium Falcon with no training? Beating a experienced fighter like Kylo-Ren on your first try lightsabering? I'm sorry but thats taking it a wee bit to far. Then there is Han Solo. I know that was supposed to make you cry because you know he commited patricide and its frickin' Han Solo. I was mad. Han Solo is the greatest Star Wars character of all time (behind Darth Vader of course!) and you just plain kill him off like THAT! He did NOTHING heroic he didn't even hold a lightsaber until Kylo-Ren stuck it through his chest. Then there's Finn. I understand Star Wars need to have a black guy in their movies because most characters are middle-aged white guys like our favorite character Kylo-Ren! But honestly Finn just dosen't have that many action moments and isn't that great a character. Then there is Po. Po has a huge ego as is confirmed in The Last Jedi. My impression of him is this: "Hi I'm Po. I'm better than all of you. I should be commander because I'm a white middle-aged guy.". As a bonus he has BB-8 on his ship beeping in a vaugely happy or scared way! And as unrealistic as ever the laser beams magically hit all the ships but Po's! Po swoops in for and unrealistic blowing up of Starkiller Base. Oh I'm sorry you said you needed a BIGGER Death Star. Come on J.J. Abrams. Star Wars is worth like a billion dollars. You can afford to buy a better idea then a bigger Death Star. And then they're trying to find that missing puzzle piece to find none other than... LUKE SKYWALKER!!! They find him Rey gives him the lightsaber and the movie ends. They magically blow up Starkiller Base and coincidentally they also find the last puzzle piece!<br>Now if you don't agree with me screw you. I hated this movie and I urge you to join me to hate The Force Awakens. People who hate the Last Jedi I'm with you 100%. I hate the Last Jedi. I wrote a rant for that too. But I am so sorry The Force Awakens is THE WORST movie of all time., 0.5,  Hamilton R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977165094/, March 14 2018, N/A

 The Force Awakens is a welcome return to the lived-in universe of the well-loved original trilogy. The characters are engaging the visuals are stunning and the story adeptly balances the old and the new. However the film suffers from a rehashed plot that lifts elements from A New Hope and essentially recrafts them sometimes to a fault. Though derivative TFA's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. The film manages even in the face of unprecedented hype to recapture the boundless energy that embodied the originals and was so lacking in the prequels. The Force has awakened and it's here to stay., 3.5,  Scott M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/972643831/, March 13 2018, N/A
 It has been a few years since this abomination came out. But I recently wrote a review for TLJ and I am probably going to write a review for the other SW films. But this one in particular is a horrid excuse for a film. <br><br>I will explain. First this nothing but a rehash of episode 4. But more creatively bankrupt and disgusting. And it irritates me to no end when I see/n the "apologists" for this crap over the years. The excuses that pour out of these morons are putrid! Like<br><br>"they needed to rehash it because they wanted to bring fans back that didn't like the prequels!"<br>"It needed to be done to show that SW can be exciting!" <br>"they needed to reboot it for the newer generations benefit!" <br><br><br>Even Jar Jar Abrams has admitted to rehashing it. So he basically said the he had to "play it safe" to get fans back. Uh...NO! When I see morons say how they had to "play it safe" they are just admitting that they love laziness and used ideas. Well you got another OT now you whiny rejects. Are you happy with the same crap over and over? Never mind you are! And when or if episode 10 rolls around I am very positive that they will have another trilogy of rebels vs the mighty empire. Because it is obvious that all these morons want is more of the same. <br><br>I could go on but my point is that the "apologists" bend over backwards to excuse laziness. The only obligation they had to do was to make a sequel to ROTJ. But the idiots that enjoy this drivel like being patronized by a corporate entity. They basically tried to "buy" fans back by giving them reheated left overs and calling it "new." These people who bought into it are pathetic! <br><br>Disney and LFL basically were selling the new generation used experiences. Like "hey kids? Do you want to feel the way your parents felt when the first seen SW?" This is basically robbing the newer generation of their OWN authentic experiences. That is pretty low. But since Disney and LFL apparently have no balls they just gave the world the OT 2.0. And the idiots just fell in love with the same old stuff. Some for the first time and some for the second time. With how TLJ came out they don't really do original all too well. <br><br><br>But the biggest issue for me was how they treated the force in this. MaRey Sue uses the force with 0 training. That is right. 0 training! I did pay attention to the film though. As many who claim to "love" it have not. Because it took me all but one line of dialogue to figure this out. <br><br>Kylo Ren to Snoke: She is UNTRAINED! But stronger then she knows! <br><br>See? One line of dialogue. Did that stop all the "Reytards" from wasting 2 years thinking up every excuse to try to explain how she did what she did? Nope. I had to argue for those 2 years telling these cretins that she was untrained . If they actually paid attention they wouldn't have made themselves look like tools making excuses when it was spelled out for them in the film. <br><br><br>And nice what they did to Han eh? He went back to being a smuggler. But he also became a dead beat dad too! Then killed by his own son. After knowing his son had "too much Vader" in him Han tries to talk him into coming home like he was a 10 year old that was mad because he didn't want to leave the arcade. But Han knew he wasn't coming home and I guess he got what he knew he would get. <br><br><br>And then General Leia. She was a general in the OT and also in the ST. Now that is character development right there.../S<br><br><br>Finn is the worst character in the SW universe. Well he is tied with Rose now. But in TFA he basically gets shell shock on his first mission without even firing a shot. And then he wants to run from the FO because?...Reasons? I guess this is where the new books have to be taken into account. That is what the fans of this drek seem to tell you when something doesn't get explained. You basically need a manual to watch a movie now with these new ones. I know he didn't want to kill for the FO anymore. Not that he ever did in the first place. Because Jakku was his first mission.

 This film is great in all of the following things: Acting visuals score costume design and screenplay. But all of that is ruined by J.J. Abrams lack of storytelling.

 Capturing the old Star Wars vibe cantina and all this movie continues the saga with an amazing start. Rey played by Daisy Ridley steals the show in this film followed in a close second by Harrison Ford's Han Solo the same as ever. Adam Driver and John Boyega also deliver some good performances as side characters in the movie but they play their roles very well. Oscaar Isaac has a very small role in this and while it is small he is very noteworthy in those moments.

 Where do I begin? For one I don't like any Star Wars at all. Unfortunately my wife is a huge fan so I have seen all of them. But the one movie that stood out from all was this The Force Awakens. It starts out with a brand-new droid who is supposed to be cute but is really just two spheres stacked up on each other. Kylo-Ren isn't a good villian. That is one god-ugly mask he has and. Kylo-Ren's ugly pale face is supposed to look evil. He looks like a nerd before a math test. And then as we learn in The Last Jedi he survived! Rey practically chopped off every body part he had. Now lets start with Rey. I mean I get the girl power stuff and everything. I get that a strong female character is what you should promote in a male-dominate country like the U.S.A (cough cough no female president. we elect cheese puffs instead.) But seriously? Flying the Millenium Falcon with no training? Beating a experienced fighter like Kylo-Ren on your first try lightsabering? I'm sorry but thats taking it a wee bit to far. Then there is Han Solo. I know that was supposed to make you cry because you know he commited patricide and its frickin' Han Solo. I was mad. Han Solo is the greatest Star Wars character of all time (behind Darth Vader of course!) and you just plain kill him off like THAT! He did NOTHING heroic he didn't even hold a lightsaber until Kylo-Ren stuck it through his chest. Then there's Finn. I understand Star Wars need to have a black guy in their movies because most characters are middle-aged white guys like our favorite character Kylo-Ren! But honestly Finn just dosen't have that many action moments and isn't that great a character. Then there is Po. Po has a huge ego as is confirmed in The Last Jedi. My impression of him is this: "Hi I'm Po. I'm better than all of you. I should be commander because I'm a white middle-aged guy.". As a bonus he has BB-8 on his ship beeping in a vaugely happy or scared way! And as unrealistic as ever the laser beams magically hit all the ships but Po's! Po swoops in for and unrealistic blowing up of Starkiller Base. Oh I'm sorry you said you needed a BIGGER Death Star. Come on J.J. Abrams. Star Wars is worth like a billion dollars. You can afford to buy a better idea then a bigger Death Star. And then they're trying to find that missing puzzle piece to find none other than... LUKE SKYWALKER!!! They find him Rey gives him the lightsaber and the movie ends. They magically blow up Starkiller Base and coincidentally they also find the last puzzle piece!<br>Now if you don't agree with me screw you. I hated this movie and I urge you to join me to hate The Force Awakens. People who hate the Last Jedi I'm with you 100%. I hate the Last Jedi. I wrote a rant for that too. But I am so sorry The Force Awakens is THE WORST movie of all time., 0.5,  Hamilton R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977165094/, March 14 2018, N/A

 The Force Awakens is a welcome return to the lived-in universe of the well-loved original trilogy. The characters are engaging the visuals are stunning and the story adeptly balances the old and the new. However the film suffers from a rehashed plot that lifts elements from A New Hope and essentially recrafts them sometimes to a fault. Though derivative TFA's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. The film manages even in the face of unprecedented hype to recapture the boundless energy that embodied the originals and was so lacking in the prequels. The Force has awakened and it's here to stay., 3.5,  Scott M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/972643831/, March 13 2018, N/A
 It has been a few years since this abomination came out. But I recently wrote a review for TLJ and I am probably going to write a review for the other SW films. But this one in particular is a horrid excuse for a film. <br><br>I will explain. First this nothing but a rehash of episode 4. But more creatively bankrupt and disgusting. And it irritates me to no end when I see/n the "apologists" for this crap over the years. The excuses that pour out of these morons are putrid! Like<br><br>"they needed to rehash it because they wanted to bring fans back that didn't like the prequels!"<br>"It needed to be done to show that SW can be exciting!" <br>"they needed to reboot it for the newer generations benefit!" <br><br><br>Even Jar Jar Abrams has admitted to rehashing it. So he basically said the he had to "play it safe" to get fans back. Uh...NO! When I see morons say how they had to "play it safe" they are just admitting that they love laziness and used ideas. Well you got another OT now you whiny rejects. Are you happy with the same crap over and over? Never mind you are! And when or if episode 10 rolls around I am very positive that they will have another trilogy of rebels vs the mighty empire. Because it is obvious that all these morons want is more of the same. <br><br>I could go on but my point is that the "apologists" bend over backwards to excuse laziness. The only obligation they had to do was to make a sequel to ROTJ. But the idiots that enjoy this drivel like being patronized by a corporate entity. They basically tried to "buy" fans back by giving them reheated left overs and calling it "new." These people who bought into it are pathetic! <br><br>Disney and LFL basically were selling the new generation used experiences. Like "hey kids? Do you want to feel the way your parents felt when the first seen SW?" This is basically robbing the newer generation of their OWN authentic experiences. That is pretty low. But since Disney and LFL apparently have no balls they just gave the world the OT 2.0. And the idiots just fell in love with the same old stuff. Some for the first time and some for the second time. With how TLJ came out they don't really do original all too well. <br><br><br>But the biggest issue for me was how they treated the force in this. MaRey Sue uses the force with 0 training. That is right. 0 training! I did pay attention to the film though. As many who claim to "love" it have not. Because it took me all but one line of dialogue to figure this out. <br><br>Kylo Ren to Snoke: She is UNTRAINED! But stronger then she knows! <br><br>See? One line of dialogue. Did that stop all the "Reytards" from wasting 2 years thinking up every excuse to try to explain how she did what she did? Nope. I had to argue for those 2 years telling these cretins that she was untrained . If they actually paid attention they wouldn't have made themselves look like tools making excuses when it was spelled out for them in the film. <br><br><br>And nice what they did to Han eh? He went back to being a smuggler. But he also became a dead beat dad too! Then killed by his own son. After knowing his son had "too much Vader" in him Han tries to talk him into coming home like he was a 10 year old that was mad because he didn't want to leave the arcade. But Han knew he wasn't coming home and I guess he got what he knew he would get. <br><br><br>And then General Leia. She was a general in the OT and also in the ST.

 This film is great in all of the following things: Acting visuals score costume design and screenplay. But all of that is ruined by J.J. Abrams lack of storytelling.

 Capturing the old Star Wars vibe cantina and all this movie continues the saga with an amazing start. Rey played by Daisy Ridley steals the show in this film followed in a close second by Harrison Ford's Han Solo the same as ever. Adam Driver and John Boyega also deliver some good performances as side characters in the movie but they play their roles very well. Oscaar Isaac has a very small role in this and while it is small he is very noteworthy in those moments.

 Where do I begin? For one I don't like any Star Wars at all. Unfortunately my wife is a huge fan so I have seen all of them. But the one movie that stood out from all was this The Force Awakens. It starts out with a brand-new droid who is supposed to be cute but is really just two spheres stacked up on each other. Kylo-Ren isn't a good villian. That is one god-ugly mask he has and. Kylo-Ren's ugly pale face is supposed to look evil. He looks like a nerd before a math test. And then as we learn in The Last Jedi he survived! Rey practically chopped off every body part he had. Now lets start with Rey. I mean I get the girl power stuff and everything. I get that a strong female character is what you should promote in a male-dominate country like the U.S.A (cough cough no female president. we elect cheese puffs instead.) But seriously? Flying the Millenium Falcon with no training? Beating a experienced fighter like Kylo-Ren on your first try lightsabering? I'm sorry but thats taking it a wee bit to far. Then there is Han Solo. I know that was supposed to make you cry because you know he commited patricide and its frickin' Han Solo. I was mad. Han Solo is the greatest Star Wars character of all time (behind Darth Vader of course!) and you just plain kill him off like THAT! He did NOTHING heroic he didn't even hold a lightsaber until Kylo-Ren stuck it through his chest. Then there's Finn. I understand Star Wars need to have a black guy in their movies because most characters are middle-aged white guys like our favorite character Kylo-Ren! But honestly Finn just dosen't have that many action moments and isn't that great a character. Then there is Po. Po has a huge ego as is confirmed in The Last Jedi. My impression of him is this: "Hi I'm Po. I'm better than all of you. I should be commander because I'm a white middle-aged guy.". As a bonus he has BB-8 on his ship beeping in a vaugely happy or scared way! And as unrealistic as ever the laser beams magically hit all the ships but Po's! Po swoops in for and unrealistic blowing up of Starkiller Base. Oh I'm sorry you said you needed a BIGGER Death Star. Come on J.J. Abrams. Star Wars is worth like a billion dollars. You can afford to buy a better idea then a bigger Death Star. And then they're trying to find that missing puzzle piece to find none other than... LUKE SKYWALKER!!! They find him Rey gives him the lightsaber and the movie ends. They magically blow up Starkiller Base and coincidentally they also find the last puzzle piece!<br>Now if you don't agree with me screw you. I hated this movie and I urge you to join me to hate The Force Awakens. People who hate the Last Jedi I'm with you 100%. I hate the Last Jedi. I wrote a rant for that too. But I am so sorry The Force Awakens is THE WORST movie of all time., 0.5,  Hamilton R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977165094/, March 14 2018, N/A

 The Force Awakens is a welcome return to the lived-in universe of the well-loved original trilogy. The characters are engaging the visuals are stunning and the story adeptly balances the old and the new. However the film suffers from a rehashed plot that lifts elements from A New Hope and essentially recrafts them sometimes to a fault. Though derivative TFA's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. The film manages even in the face of unprecedented hype to recapture the boundless energy that embodied the originals and was so lacking in the prequels. The Force has awakened and it's here to stay., 3.5,  Scott M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/972643831/, March 13 2018, N/A
 It has been a few years since this abomination came out. But I recently wrote a review for TLJ and I am probably going to write a review for the other SW films. But this one in particular is a horrid excuse for a film. <br><br>I will explain. First this nothing but a rehash of episode 4. But more creatively bankrupt and disgusting. And it irritates me to no end when I see/n the "apologists" for this crap over the years. The excuses that pour out of these morons are putrid! Like<br><br>"they needed to rehash it because they wanted to bring fans back that didn't like the prequels!"<br>"It needed to be done to show that SW can be exciting!" <br>"they needed to reboot it for the newer generations benefit!" <br><br><br>Even Jar Jar Abrams has admitted to rehashing it. So he basically said the he had to "play it safe" to get fans back. Uh...NO! When I see morons say how they had to "play it safe" they are just admitting that they love laziness and used ideas. Well you got another OT now you whiny rejects. Are you happy with the same crap over and over? Never mind you are! And when or if episode 10 rolls around I am very positive that they will have another trilogy of rebels vs the mighty empire. Because it is obvious that all these morons want is more of the same. <br><br>I could go on but my point is that the "apologists" bend over backwards to excuse laziness. The only obligation they had to do was to make a sequel to ROTJ. But the idiots that enjoy this drivel like being patronized by a corporate entity. They basically tried to "buy" fans back by giving them reheated left overs and calling it "new." These people who bought into it are pathetic! <br><br>Disney and LFL basically were selling the new generation used experiences. Like "hey kids? Do you want to feel the way your parents felt when the first seen SW?" This is basically robbing the newer generation of their OWN authentic experiences. That is pretty low. But since Disney and LFL apparently have no balls they just gave the world the OT 2.0. And the idiots just fell in love with the same old stuff. Some for the first time and some for the second time. With how TLJ came out they don't really do original all too well. <br><br><br>But the biggest issue for me was how they treated the force in this. MaRey Sue uses the force with 0 training. That is right. 0 training! I did pay attention to the film though. As many who claim to "love" it have not. Because it took me all but one line of dialogue to figure this out. <br><br>Kylo Ren to Snoke: She is UNTRAINED! But stronger then she knows! <br><br>See? One line of dialogue. Did that stop all the "Reytards" from wasting 2 years thinking up every excuse to try to explain how she did what she did? Nope. I had to argue for those 2 years telling these cretins that she was untrained .

That is right. 0 training! I did pay attention to the film though. As many who claim to "love" it have not. Because it took me all but one line of dialogue to figure this out. <br><br>Kylo Ren to Snoke: She is UNTRAINED! But stronger then she knows! <br><br>See? One line of dialogue. Did that stop all the "Reytards" from wasting 2 years thinking up every excuse to try to explain how she did what she did? Nope. I had to argue for those 2 years telling these cretins that she was untrained . If they actually paid attention they wouldn't have made themselves look like tools making excuses when it was spelled out for them in the film. <br><br><br>And nice what they did to Han eh? He went back to being a smuggler. But he also became a dead beat dad too! Then killed by his own son. After knowing his son had "too much Vader" in him Han tries to talk him into coming home like he was a 10 year old that was mad because he didn't want to leave the arcade. But Han knew he wasn't coming home and I guess he got what he knew he would get. <br><br><br>And then General Leia. She was a general in the OT and also in the ST. Now that is character development right there.../S<br><br><br>Finn is the worst character in the SW universe. Well he is tied with Rose now. But in TFA he basically gets shell shock on his first mission without even firing a shot. And then he wants to run from the FO because?...Reasons? I guess this is where the new books have to be taken into account. That is what the fans of this drek seem to tell you when something doesn't get explained. You basically need a manual to watch a movie now with these new ones. I know he didn't want to kill for the FO anymore. Not that he ever did in the first place. Because Jakku was his first mission. But he will kill for anyone else without thinking twice. <br><br><br>Then we have Maz. She was the one in all her infinite wisdom to yell out "HAN SOLO!" in a crowded bar knowing he has a a price on his head and also brings BB-8 with him knowing the FO is looking for it. But back to Maz. When they are sitting at the table talking she tells all of them that they must fight the FO! Then the FO brings the fight to her doorstep. And where is big game talking Maz? Oh yeah she is hiding away somewhere. <br><br><br>But this has been long enough already. I am pretty bored just thinking about TFA. Garbage movie for garbage lovers! Oh and these new Disney movies are made for the "Veruca Salt" generation. The "I want it now" ones.<br><br>"Real sets! Practical and tangible sets"...Blah blah blah! It is hillariious how some morons bought into this. TFA was a CGI fest covered turd and the idiots bought it. Disney and co. lied to your faces!

 This film is great in all of the following things: Acting visuals score costume design and screenplay. But all of that is ruined by J.J. Abrams lack of storytelling.

 Capturing the old Star Wars vibe cantina and all this movie continues the saga with an amazing start. Rey played by Daisy Ridley steals the show in this film followed in a close second by Harrison Ford's Han Solo the same as ever. Adam Driver and John Boyega also deliver some good performances as side characters in the movie but they play their roles very well. Oscaar Isaac has a very small role in this and while it is small he is very noteworthy in those moments.

 Where do I begin? For one I don't like any Star Wars at all. Unfortunately my wife is a huge fan so I have seen all of them. But the one movie that stood out from all was this The Force Awakens. It starts out with a brand-new droid who is supposed to be cute but is really just two spheres stacked up on each other. Kylo-Ren isn't a good villian. That is one god-ugly mask he has and. Kylo-Ren's ugly pale face is supposed to look evil. He looks like a nerd before a math test. And then as we learn in The Last Jedi he survived! Rey practically chopped off every body part he had. Now lets start with Rey. I mean I get the girl power stuff and everything. I get that a strong female character is what you should promote in a male-dominate country like the U.S.A (cough cough no female president. we elect cheese puffs instead.) But seriously? Flying the Millenium Falcon with no training? Beating a experienced fighter like Kylo-Ren on your first try lightsabering? I'm sorry but thats taking it a wee bit to far. Then there is Han Solo. I know that was supposed to make you cry because you know he commited patricide and its frickin' Han Solo. I was mad. Han Solo is the greatest Star Wars character of all time (behind Darth Vader of course!) and you just plain kill him off like THAT! He did NOTHING heroic he didn't even hold a lightsaber until Kylo-Ren stuck it through his chest. Then there's Finn. I understand Star Wars need to have a black guy in their movies because most characters are middle-aged white guys like our favorite character Kylo-Ren! But honestly Finn just dosen't have that many action moments and isn't that great a character. Then there is Po. Po has a huge ego as is confirmed in The Last Jedi. My impression of him is this: "Hi I'm Po. I'm better than all of you. I should be commander because I'm a white middle-aged guy.". As a bonus he has BB-8 on his ship beeping in a vaugely happy or scared way! And as unrealistic as ever the laser beams magically hit all the ships but Po's! Po swoops in for and unrealistic blowing up of Starkiller Base. Oh I'm sorry you said you needed a BIGGER Death Star. Come on J.J. Abrams. Star Wars is worth like a billion dollars. You can afford to buy a better idea then a bigger Death Star. And then they're trying to find that missing puzzle piece to find none other than... LUKE SKYWALKER!!! They find him Rey gives him the lightsaber and the movie ends. They magically blow up Starkiller Base and coincidentally they also find the last puzzle piece!<br>Now if you don't agree with me screw you. I hated this movie and I urge you to join me to hate The Force Awakens. People who hate the Last Jedi I'm with you 100%. I hate the Last Jedi. I wrote a rant for that too. But I am so sorry The Force Awakens is THE WORST movie of all time., 0.5,  Hamilton R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977165094/, March 14 2018, N/A

 The Force Awakens is a welcome return to the lived-in universe of the well-loved original trilogy. The characters are engaging the visuals are stunning and the story adeptly balances the old and the new. However the film suffers from a rehashed plot that lifts elements from A New Hope and essentially recrafts them sometimes to a fault. Though derivative TFA's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. The film manages even in the face of unprecedented hype to recapture the boundless energy that embodied the originals and was so lacking in the prequels. The Force has awakened and it's here to stay., 3.5,  Scott M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/972643831/, March 13 2018, N/A
 It has been a few years since this abomination came out. But I recently wrote a review for TLJ and I am probably going to write a review for the other SW films. But this one in particular is a horrid excuse for a film. <br><br>I will explain. First this nothing but a rehash of episode 4. But more creatively bankrupt and disgusting. And it irritates me to no end when I see/n the "apologists" for this crap over the years. The excuses that pour out of these morons are putrid! Like<br><br>"they needed to rehash it because they wanted to bring fans back that didn't like the prequels!"<br>"It needed to be done to show that SW can be exciting!" <br>"they needed to reboot it for the newer generations benefit!" <br><br><br>Even Jar Jar Abrams has admitted to rehashing it. So he basically said the he had to "play it safe" to get fans back. Uh...NO! When I see morons say how they had to "play it safe" they are just admitting that they love laziness and used ideas. Well you got another OT now you whiny rejects. Are you happy with the same crap over and over? Never mind you are! And when or if episode 10 rolls around I am very positive that they will have another trilogy of rebels vs the mighty empire. Because it is obvious that all these morons want is more of the same. <br><br>I could go on but my point is that the "apologists" bend over backwards to excuse laziness. The only obligation they had to do was to make a sequel to ROTJ. But the idiots that enjoy this drivel like being patronized by a corporate entity. They basically tried to "buy" fans back by giving them reheated left overs and calling it "new." These people who bought into it are pathetic! <br><br>Disney and LFL basically were selling the new generation used experiences. Like "hey kids? Do you want to feel the way your parents felt when the first seen SW?" This is basically robbing the newer generation of their OWN authentic experiences. That is pretty low. But since Disney and LFL apparently have no balls they just gave the world the OT 2.0. And the idiots just fell in love with the same old stuff. Some for the first time and some for the second time.

But since Disney and LFL apparently have no balls they just gave the world the OT 2.0. And the idiots just fell in love with the same old stuff. Some for the first time and some for the second time. With how TLJ came out they don't really do original all too well. <br><br><br>But the biggest issue for me was how they treated the force in this. MaRey Sue uses the force with 0 training. That is right. 0 training! I did pay attention to the film though. As many who claim to "love" it have not. Because it took me all but one line of dialogue to figure this out. <br><br>Kylo Ren to Snoke: She is UNTRAINED! But stronger then she knows! <br><br>See? One line of dialogue. Did that stop all the "Reytards" from wasting 2 years thinking up every excuse to try to explain how she did what she did? Nope. I had to argue for those 2 years telling these cretins that she was untrained . If they actually paid attention they wouldn't have made themselves look like tools making excuses when it was spelled out for them in the film. <br><br><br>And nice what they did to Han eh? He went back to being a smuggler. But he also became a dead beat dad too! Then killed by his own son. After knowing his son had "too much Vader" in him Han tries to talk him into coming home like he was a 10 year old that was mad because he didn't want to leave the arcade. But Han knew he wasn't coming home and I guess he got what he knew he would get. <br><br><br>And then General Leia. She was a general in the OT and also in the ST. Now that is character development right there.../S<br><br><br>Finn is the worst character in the SW universe. Well he is tied with Rose now. But in TFA he basically gets shell shock on his first mission without even firing a shot. And then he wants to run from the FO because?...Reasons? I guess this is where the new books have to be taken into account. That is what the fans of this drek seem to tell you when something doesn't get explained. You basically need a manual to watch a movie now with these new ones. I know he didn't want to kill for the FO anymore. Not that he ever did in the first place. Because Jakku was his first mission. But he will kill for anyone else without thinking twice. <br><br><br>Then we have Maz. She was the one in all her infinite wisdom to yell out "HAN SOLO!" in a crowded bar knowing he has a a price on his head and also brings BB-8 with him knowing the FO is looking for it. But back to Maz. When they are sitting at the table talking she tells all of them that they must fight the FO! Then the FO brings the fight to her doorstep. And where is big game talking Maz? Oh yeah she is hiding away somewhere. <br><br><br>But this has been long enough already. I am pretty bored just thinking about TFA. Garbage movie for garbage lovers! Oh and these new Disney movies are made for the "Veruca Salt" generation. The "I want it now" ones.<br><br>"Real sets! Practical and tangible sets"...Blah blah blah! It is hillariious how some morons bought into this. TFA was a CGI fest covered turd and the idiots bought it. Disney and co. lied to your faces!

 This film is great in all of the following things: Acting visuals score costume design and screenplay. But all of that is ruined by J.J. Abrams lack of storytelling.

 Capturing the old Star Wars vibe cantina and all this movie continues the saga with an amazing start. Rey played by Daisy Ridley steals the show in this film followed in a close second by Harrison Ford's Han Solo the same as ever. Adam Driver and John Boyega also deliver some good performances as side characters in the movie but they play their roles very well. Oscaar Isaac has a very small role in this and while it is small he is very noteworthy in those moments.

 Where do I begin? For one I don't like any Star Wars at all. Unfortunately my wife is a huge fan so I have seen all of them. But the one movie that stood out from all was this The Force Awakens. It starts out with a brand-new droid who is supposed to be cute but is really just two spheres stacked up on each other. Kylo-Ren isn't a good villian. That is one god-ugly mask he has and. Kylo-Ren's ugly pale face is supposed to look evil. He looks like a nerd before a math test. And then as we learn in The Last Jedi he survived! Rey practically chopped off every body part he had. Now lets start with Rey. I mean I get the girl power stuff and everything. I get that a strong female character is what you should promote in a male-dominate country like the U.S.A (cough cough no female president. we elect cheese puffs instead.) But seriously? Flying the Millenium Falcon with no training? Beating a experienced fighter like Kylo-Ren on your first try lightsabering? I'm sorry but thats taking it a wee bit to far. Then there is Han Solo. I know that was supposed to make you cry because you know he commited patricide and its frickin' Han Solo. I was mad. Han Solo is the greatest Star Wars character of all time (behind Darth Vader of course!) and you just plain kill him off like THAT! He did NOTHING heroic he didn't even hold a lightsaber until Kylo-Ren stuck it through his chest. Then there's Finn. I understand Star Wars need to have a black guy in their movies because most characters are middle-aged white guys like our favorite character Kylo-Ren! But honestly Finn just dosen't have that many action moments and isn't that great a character. Then there is Po. Po has a huge ego as is confirmed in The Last Jedi. My impression of him is this: "Hi I'm Po. I'm better than all of you. I should be commander because I'm a white middle-aged guy.". As a bonus he has BB-8 on his ship beeping in a vaugely happy or scared way! And as unrealistic as ever the laser beams magically hit all the ships but Po's! Po swoops in for and unrealistic blowing up of Starkiller Base. Oh I'm sorry you said you needed a BIGGER Death Star. Come on J.J. Abrams. Star Wars is worth like a billion dollars. You can afford to buy a better idea then a bigger Death Star. And then they're trying to find that missing puzzle piece to find none other than... LUKE SKYWALKER!!! They find him Rey gives him the lightsaber and the movie ends. They magically blow up Starkiller Base and coincidentally they also find the last puzzle piece!<br>Now if you don't agree with me screw you. I hated this movie and I urge you to join me to hate The Force Awakens. People who hate the Last Jedi I'm with you 100%. I hate the Last Jedi. I wrote a rant for that too. But I am so sorry The Force Awakens is THE WORST movie of all time., 0.5,  Hamilton R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977165094/, March 14 2018, N/A

 The Force Awakens is a welcome return to the lived-in universe of the well-loved original trilogy. The characters are engaging the visuals are stunning and the story adeptly balances the old and the new. However the film suffers from a rehashed plot that lifts elements from A New Hope and essentially recrafts them sometimes to a fault. Though derivative TFA's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. The film manages even in the face of unprecedented hype to recapture the boundless energy that embodied the originals and was so lacking in the prequels. The Force has awakened and it's here to stay., 3.5,  Scott M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/972643831/, March 13 2018, N/A
 It has been a few years since this abomination came out. But I recently wrote a review for TLJ and I am probably going to write a review for the other SW films. But this one in particular is a horrid excuse for a film. <br><br>I will explain. First this nothing but a rehash of episode 4. But more creatively bankrupt and disgusting. And it irritates me to no end when I see/n the "apologists" for this crap over the years. The excuses that pour out of these morons are putrid! Like<br><br>"they needed to rehash it because they wanted to bring fans back that didn't like the prequels!"<br>"It needed to be done to show that SW can be exciting!" <br>"they needed to reboot it for the newer generations benefit!" <br><br><br>Even Jar Jar Abrams has admitted to rehashing it. So he basically said the he had to "play it safe" to get fans back. Uh...NO! When I see morons say how they had to "play it safe" they are just admitting that they love laziness and used ideas. Well you got another OT now you whiny rejects. Are you happy with the same crap over and over? Never mind you are! And when or if episode 10 rolls around I am very positive that they will have another trilogy of rebels vs the mighty empire. Because it is obvious that all these morons want is more of the same. <br><br>I could go on but my point is that the "apologists" bend over backwards to excuse laziness. The only obligation they had to do was to make a sequel to ROTJ. But the idiots that enjoy this drivel like being patronized by a corporate entity. They basically tried to "buy" fans back by giving them reheated left overs and calling it "new."

And when or if episode 10 rolls around I am very positive that they will have another trilogy of rebels vs the mighty empire. Because it is obvious that all these morons want is more of the same. <br><br>I could go on but my point is that the "apologists" bend over backwards to excuse laziness. The only obligation they had to do was to make a sequel to ROTJ. But the idiots that enjoy this drivel like being patronized by a corporate entity. They basically tried to "buy" fans back by giving them reheated left overs and calling it "new." These people who bought into it are pathetic! <br><br>Disney and LFL basically were selling the new generation used experiences. Like "hey kids? Do you want to feel the way your parents felt when the first seen SW?" This is basically robbing the newer generation of their OWN authentic experiences. That is pretty low. But since Disney and LFL apparently have no balls they just gave the world the OT 2.0. And the idiots just fell in love with the same old stuff. Some for the first time and some for the second time. With how TLJ came out they don't really do original all too well. <br><br><br>But the biggest issue for me was how they treated the force in this. MaRey Sue uses the force with 0 training. That is right. 0 training! I did pay attention to the film though. As many who claim to "love" it have not. Because it took me all but one line of dialogue to figure this out. <br><br>Kylo Ren to Snoke: She is UNTRAINED! But stronger then she knows! <br><br>See? One line of dialogue. Did that stop all the "Reytards" from wasting 2 years thinking up every excuse to try to explain how she did what she did? Nope. I had to argue for those 2 years telling these cretins that she was untrained . If they actually paid attention they wouldn't have made themselves look like tools making excuses when it was spelled out for them in the film. <br><br><br>And nice what they did to Han eh? He went back to being a smuggler. But he also became a dead beat dad too! Then killed by his own son. After knowing his son had "too much Vader" in him Han tries to talk him into coming home like he was a 10 year old that was mad because he didn't want to leave the arcade. But Han knew he wasn't coming home and I guess he got what he knew he would get. <br><br><br>And then General Leia. She was a general in the OT and also in the ST. Now that is character development right there.../S<br><br><br>Finn is the worst character in the SW universe. Well he is tied with Rose now. But in TFA he basically gets shell shock on his first mission without even firing a shot. And then he wants to run from the FO because?...Reasons? I guess this is where the new books have to be taken into account. That is what the fans of this drek seem to tell you when something doesn't get explained. You basically need a manual to watch a movie now with these new ones. I know he didn't want to kill for the FO anymore. Not that he ever did in the first place. Because Jakku was his first mission. But he will kill for anyone else without thinking twice. <br><br><br>Then we have Maz. She was the one in all her infinite wisdom to yell out "HAN SOLO!" in a crowded bar knowing he has a a price on his head and also brings BB-8 with him knowing the FO is looking for it. But back to Maz. When they are sitting at the table talking she tells all of them that they must fight the FO! Then the FO brings the fight to her doorstep. And where is big game talking Maz? Oh yeah she is hiding away somewhere. <br><br><br>But this has been long enough already. I am pretty bored just thinking about TFA. Garbage movie for garbage lovers! Oh and these new Disney movies are made for the "Veruca Salt" generation. The "I want it now" ones.<br><br>"Real sets! Practical and tangible sets"...Blah blah blah! It is hillariious how some morons bought into this. TFA was a CGI fest covered turd and the idiots bought it. Disney and co. lied to your faces!

 Capturing the old Star Wars vibe cantina and all this movie continues the saga with an amazing start. Rey played by Daisy Ridley steals the show in this film followed in a close second by Harrison Ford's Han Solo the same as ever. Adam Driver and John Boyega also deliver some good performances as side characters in the movie but they play their roles very well.

 Where do I begin? For one I don't like any Star Wars at all. Unfortunately my wife is a huge fan so I have seen all of them. But the one movie that stood out from all was this The Force Awakens. It starts out with a brand-new droid who is supposed to be cute but is really just two spheres stacked up on each other. Kylo-Ren isn't a good villian. That is one god-ugly mask he has and. Kylo-Ren's ugly pale face is supposed to look evil. He looks like a nerd before a math test. And then as we learn in The Last Jedi he survived! Rey practically chopped off every body part he had. Now lets start with Rey. I mean I get the girl power stuff and everything. I get that a strong female character is what you should promote in a male-dominate country like the U.S.A (cough cough no female president. we elect cheese puffs instead.) But seriously? Flying the Millenium Falcon with no training? Beating a experienced fighter like Kylo-Ren on your first try lightsabering? I'm sorry but thats taking it a wee bit to far. Then there is Han Solo. I know that was supposed to make you cry because you know he commited patricide and its frickin' Han Solo. I was mad. Han Solo is the greatest Star Wars character of all time (behind Darth Vader of course!) and you just plain kill him off like THAT! He did NOTHING heroic he didn't even hold a lightsaber until Kylo-Ren stuck it through his chest. Then there's Finn. I understand Star Wars need to have a black guy in their movies because most characters are middle-aged white guys like our favorite character Kylo-Ren! But honestly Finn just dosen't have that many action moments and isn't that great a character. Then there is Po. Po has a huge ego as is confirmed in The Last Jedi. My impression of him is this: "Hi I'm Po. I'm better than all of you. I should be commander because I'm a white middle-aged guy.". As a bonus he has BB-8 on his ship beeping in a vaugely happy or scared way! And as unrealistic as ever the laser beams magically hit all the ships but Po's! Po swoops in for and unrealistic blowing up of Starkiller Base. Oh I'm sorry you said you needed a BIGGER Death Star. Come on J.J. Abrams. Star Wars is worth like a billion dollars. You can afford to buy a better idea then a bigger Death Star. And then they're trying to find that missing puzzle piece to find none other than... LUKE SKYWALKER!!! They find him Rey gives him the lightsaber and the movie ends. They magically blow up Starkiller Base and coincidentally they also find the last puzzle piece!<br>Now if you don't agree with me screw you. I hated this movie and I urge you to join me to hate The Force Awakens. People who hate the Last Jedi I'm with you 100%. I hate the Last Jedi. I wrote a rant for that too. But I am so sorry The Force Awakens is THE WORST movie of all time., 0.5,  Hamilton R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977165094/, March 14 2018, N/A

 The Force Awakens is a welcome return to the lived-in universe of the well-loved original trilogy. The characters are engaging the visuals are stunning and the story adeptly balances the old and the new. However the film suffers from a rehashed plot that lifts elements from A New Hope and essentially recrafts them sometimes to a fault. Though derivative TFA's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. The film manages even in the face of unprecedented hype to recapture the boundless energy that embodied the originals and was so lacking in the prequels.

 It has been a few years since this abomination came out. But I recently wrote a review for TLJ and I am probably going to write a review for the other SW films. But this one in particular is a horrid excuse for a film. <br><br>I will explain. First this nothing but a rehash of episode 4. But more creatively bankrupt and disgusting. And it irritates me to no end when I see/n the "apologists" for this crap over the years. The excuses that pour out of these morons are putrid! Like<br><br>"they needed to rehash it because they wanted to bring fans back that didn't like the prequels!"<br>"It needed to be done to show that SW can be exciting!" <br>"they needed to reboot it for the newer generations benefit!" <br><br><br>Even Jar Jar Abrams has admitted to rehashing it. So he basically said the he had to "play it safe" to get fans back. Uh...NO! When I see morons say how they had to "play it safe" they are just admitting that they love laziness and used ideas.

Like<br><br>"they needed to rehash it because they wanted to bring fans back that didn't like the prequels!"<br>"It needed to be done to show that SW can be exciting!" <br>"they needed to reboot it for the newer generations benefit!" <br><br><br>Even Jar Jar Abrams has admitted to rehashing it. So he basically said the he had to "play it safe" to get fans back. Uh...NO! When I see morons say how they had to "play it safe" they are just admitting that they love laziness and used ideas. Well you got another OT now you whiny rejects. Are you happy with the same crap over and over? Never mind you are! And when or if episode 10 rolls around I am very positive that they will have another trilogy of rebels vs the mighty empire. Because it is obvious that all these morons want is more of the same. <br><br>I could go on but my point is that the "apologists" bend over backwards to excuse laziness. The only obligation they had to do was to make a sequel to ROTJ. But the idiots that enjoy this drivel like being patronized by a corporate entity. They basically tried to "buy" fans back by giving them reheated left overs and calling it "new." These people who bought into it are pathetic! <br><br>Disney and LFL basically were selling the new generation used experiences. Like "hey kids? Do you want to feel the way your parents felt when the first seen SW?" This is basically robbing the newer generation of their OWN authentic experiences. That is pretty low. But since Disney and LFL apparently have no balls they just gave the world the OT 2.0. And the idiots just fell in love with the same old stuff. Some for the first time and some for the second time. With how TLJ came out they don't really do original all too well. <br><br><br>But the biggest issue for me was how they treated the force in this. MaRey Sue uses the force with 0 training. That is right. 0 training! I did pay attention to the film though. As many who claim to "love" it have not. Because it took me all but one line of dialogue to figure this out. <br><br>Kylo Ren to Snoke: She is UNTRAINED! But stronger then she knows! <br><br>See? One line of dialogue. Did that stop all the "Reytards" from wasting 2 years thinking up every excuse to try to explain how she did what she did? Nope. I had to argue for those 2 years telling these cretins that she was untrained . If they actually paid attention they wouldn't have made themselves look like tools making excuses when it was spelled out for them in the film. <br><br><br>And nice what they did to Han eh? He went back to being a smuggler. But he also became a dead beat dad too! Then killed by his own son. After knowing his son had "too much Vader" in him Han tries to talk him into coming home like he was a 10 year old that was mad because he didn't want to leave the arcade. But Han knew he wasn't coming home and I guess he got what he knew he would get. <br><br><br>And then General Leia. She was a general in the OT and also in the ST. Now that is character development right there.../S<br><br><br>Finn is the worst character in the SW universe. Well he is tied with Rose now. But in TFA he basically gets shell shock on his first mission without even firing a shot. And then he wants to run from the FO because?...Reasons? I guess this is where the new books have to be taken into account. That is what the fans of this drek seem to tell you when something doesn't get explained. You basically need a manual to watch a movie now with these new ones. I know he didn't want to kill for the FO anymore. Not that he ever did in the first place. Because Jakku was his first mission. But he will kill for anyone else without thinking twice. <br><br><br>Then we have Maz. She was the one in all her infinite wisdom to yell out "HAN SOLO!" in a crowded bar knowing he has a a price on his head and also brings BB-8 with him knowing the FO is looking for it. But back to Maz. When they are sitting at the table talking she tells all of them that they must fight the FO! Then the FO brings the fight to her doorstep. And where is big game talking Maz? Oh yeah she is hiding away somewhere. <br><br><br>But this has been long enough already. I am pretty bored just thinking about TFA. Garbage movie for garbage lovers! Oh and these new Disney movies are made for the "Veruca Salt" generation. The "I want it now" ones.<br><br>"Real sets! Practical and tangible sets"...Blah blah blah! It is hillariious how some morons bought into this. TFA was a CGI fest covered turd and the idiots bought it. Disney and co. lied to your faces! They basically bent you over and had their way with you and since you are drones you took it all and asked for seconds. SMFH... So how did all that "going back to the old school" BS work out for ya?

 Capturing the old Star Wars vibe cantina and all this movie continues the saga with an amazing start. Rey played by Daisy Ridley steals the show in this film followed in a close second by Harrison Ford's Han Solo the same as ever. Adam Driver and John Boyega also deliver some good performances as side characters in the movie but they play their roles very well.

 Where do I begin? For one I don't like any Star Wars at all. Unfortunately my wife is a huge fan so I have seen all of them. But the one movie that stood out from all was this The Force Awakens. It starts out with a brand-new droid who is supposed to be cute but is really just two spheres stacked up on each other. Kylo-Ren isn't a good villian. That is one god-ugly mask he has and. Kylo-Ren's ugly pale face is supposed to look evil. He looks like a nerd before a math test. And then as we learn in The Last Jedi he survived! Rey practically chopped off every body part he had. Now lets start with Rey. I mean I get the girl power stuff and everything. I get that a strong female character is what you should promote in a male-dominate country like the U.S.A (cough cough no female president. we elect cheese puffs instead.) But seriously? Flying the Millenium Falcon with no training? Beating a experienced fighter like Kylo-Ren on your first try lightsabering? I'm sorry but thats taking it a wee bit to far. Then there is Han Solo. I know that was supposed to make you cry because you know he commited patricide and its frickin' Han Solo. I was mad. Han Solo is the greatest Star Wars character of all time (behind Darth Vader of course!) and you just plain kill him off like THAT! He did NOTHING heroic he didn't even hold a lightsaber until Kylo-Ren stuck it through his chest. Then there's Finn. I understand Star Wars need to have a black guy in their movies because most characters are middle-aged white guys like our favorite character Kylo-Ren! But honestly Finn just dosen't have that many action moments and isn't that great a character. Then there is Po. Po has a huge ego as is confirmed in The Last Jedi. My impression of him is this: "Hi I'm Po. I'm better than all of you. I should be commander because I'm a white middle-aged guy.". As a bonus he has BB-8 on his ship beeping in a vaugely happy or scared way! And as unrealistic as ever the laser beams magically hit all the ships but Po's! Po swoops in for and unrealistic blowing up of Starkiller Base. Oh I'm sorry you said you needed a BIGGER Death Star. Come on J.J. Abrams. Star Wars is worth like a billion dollars. You can afford to buy a better idea then a bigger Death Star. And then they're trying to find that missing puzzle piece to find none other than... LUKE SKYWALKER!!! They find him Rey gives him the lightsaber and the movie ends. They magically blow up Starkiller Base and coincidentally they also find the last puzzle piece!<br>Now if you don't agree with me screw you. I hated this movie and I urge you to join me to hate The Force Awakens. People who hate the Last Jedi I'm with you 100%. I hate the Last Jedi. I wrote a rant for that too. But I am so sorry The Force Awakens is THE WORST movie of all time., 0.5,  Hamilton R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977165094/, March 14 2018, N/A

 The Force Awakens is a welcome return to the lived-in universe of the well-loved original trilogy. The characters are engaging the visuals are stunning and the story adeptly balances the old and the new. However the film suffers from a rehashed plot that lifts elements from A New Hope and essentially recrafts them sometimes to a fault. Though derivative TFA's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. The film manages even in the face of unprecedented hype to recapture the boundless energy that embodied the originals and was so lacking in the prequels. The Force has awakened and it's here to stay., 3.5,  Scott M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/972643831/, March 13 2018, N/A

 It has been a few years since this abomination came out. But I recently wrote a review for TLJ and I am probably going to write a review for the other SW films. But this one in particular is a horrid excuse for a film. <br><br>I will explain. First this nothing but a rehash of episode 4. But more creatively bankrupt and disgusting. And it irritates me to no end when I see/n the "apologists" for this crap over the years. The excuses that pour out of these morons are putrid! Like<br><br>"they needed to rehash it because they wanted to bring fans back that didn't like the prequels!"<br>"It needed to be done to show that SW can be exciting!" <br>"they needed to reboot it for the newer generations benefit!" <br><br><br>Even Jar Jar Abrams has admitted to rehashing it. So he basically said the he had to "play it safe" to get fans back. Uh...NO! When I see morons say how they had to "play it safe" they are just admitting that they love laziness and used ideas. Well you got another OT now you whiny rejects. Are you happy with the same crap over and over? Never mind you are! And when or if episode 10 rolls around I am very positive that they will have another trilogy of rebels vs the mighty empire. Because it is obvious that all these morons want is more of the same. <br><br>I could go on but my point is that the "apologists" bend over backwards to excuse laziness. The only obligation they had to do was to make a sequel to ROTJ. But the idiots that enjoy this drivel like being patronized by a corporate entity. They basically tried to "buy" fans back by giving them reheated left overs and calling it "new." These people who bought into it are pathetic! <br><br>Disney and LFL basically were selling the new generation used experiences. Like "hey kids? Do you want to feel the way your parents felt when the first seen SW?" This is basically robbing the newer generation of their OWN authentic experiences. That is pretty low. But since Disney and LFL apparently have no balls they just gave the world the OT 2.0. And the idiots just fell in love with the same old stuff. Some for the first time and some for the second time. With how TLJ came out they don't really do original all too well. <br><br><br>But the biggest issue for me was how they treated the force in this. MaRey Sue uses the force with 0 training. That is right. 0 training! I did pay attention to the film though. As many who claim to "love" it have not. Because it took me all but one line of dialogue to figure this out. <br><br>Kylo Ren to Snoke: She is UNTRAINED! But stronger then she knows! <br><br>See? One line of dialogue. Did that stop all the "Reytards" from wasting 2 years thinking up every excuse to try to explain how she did what she did? Nope. I had to argue for those 2 years telling these cretins that she was untrained . If they actually paid attention they wouldn't have made themselves look like tools making excuses when it was spelled out for them in the film. <br><br><br>And nice what they did to Han eh? He went back to being a smuggler. But he also became a dead beat dad too! Then killed by his own son. After knowing his son had "too much Vader" in him Han tries to talk him into coming home like he was a 10 year old that was mad because he didn't want to leave the arcade. But Han knew he wasn't coming home and I guess he got what he knew he would get. <br><br><br>And then General Leia. She was a general in the OT and also in the ST. Now that is character development right there.../S<br><br><br>Finn is the worst character in the SW universe. Well he is tied with Rose now. But in TFA he basically gets shell shock on his first mission without even firing a shot. And then he wants to run from the FO because?...Reasons? I guess this is where the new books have to be taken into account. That is what the fans of this drek seem to tell you when something doesn't get explained. You basically need a manual to watch a movie now with these new ones. I know he didn't want to kill for the FO anymore. Not that he ever did in the first place. Because Jakku was his first mission. But he will kill for anyone else without thinking twice. <br><br><br>Then we have Maz. She was the one in all her infinite wisdom to yell out "HAN SOLO!" in a crowded bar knowing he has a a price on his head and also brings BB-8 with him knowing the FO is looking for it. But back to Maz. When they are sitting at the table talking she tells all of them that they must fight the FO! Then the FO brings the fight to her doorstep. And where is big game talking Maz? Oh yeah she is hiding away somewhere. <br><br><br>But this has been long enough already. I am pretty bored just thinking about TFA. Garbage movie for garbage lovers! Oh and these new Disney movies are made for the "Veruca Salt" generation. The "I want it now" ones.<br><br>"Real sets! Practical and tangible sets"...Blah blah blah! It is hillariious how some morons bought into this. TFA was a CGI fest covered turd and the idiots bought it. Disney and co. lied to your faces! They basically bent you over and had their way with you and since you are drones you took it all and asked for seconds. SMFH... So how did all that "going back to the old school" BS work out for ya?

Also an example of the plot being slapped together is how Rey somehow is a badass overnight when in the past we see Luke Skywalker and even the badass Darth Vader spent years mastering their skills and abilities.

 Capturing the old Star Wars vibe cantina and all this movie continues the saga with an amazing start. Rey played by Daisy Ridley steals the show in this film followed in a close second by Harrison Ford's Han Solo the same as ever. Adam Driver and John Boyega also deliver some good performances as side characters in the movie but they play their roles very well. Oscaar Isaac has a very small role in this and while it is small he is very noteworthy in those moments.

 Where do I begin? For one I don't like any Star Wars at all. Unfortunately my wife is a huge fan so I have seen all of them. But the one movie that stood out from all was this The Force Awakens. It starts out with a brand-new droid who is supposed to be cute but is really just two spheres stacked up on each other. Kylo-Ren isn't a good villian. That is one god-ugly mask he has and. Kylo-Ren's ugly pale face is supposed to look evil. He looks like a nerd before a math test. And then as we learn in The Last Jedi he survived! Rey practically chopped off every body part he had. Now lets start with Rey. I mean I get the girl power stuff and everything. I get that a strong female character is what you should promote in a male-dominate country like the U.S.A (cough cough no female president. we elect cheese puffs instead.) But seriously? Flying the Millenium Falcon with no training? Beating a experienced fighter like Kylo-Ren on your first try lightsabering? I'm sorry but thats taking it a wee bit to far. Then there is Han Solo. I know that was supposed to make you cry because you know he commited patricide and its frickin' Han Solo. I was mad. Han Solo is the greatest Star Wars character of all time (behind Darth Vader of course!) and you just plain kill him off like THAT! He did NOTHING heroic he didn't even hold a lightsaber until Kylo-Ren stuck it through his chest. Then there's Finn. I understand Star Wars need to have a black guy in their movies because most characters are middle-aged white guys like our favorite character Kylo-Ren! But honestly Finn just dosen't have that many action moments and isn't that great a character. Then there is Po. Po has a huge ego as is confirmed in The Last Jedi. My impression of him is this: "Hi I'm Po. I'm better than all of you. I should be commander because I'm a white middle-aged guy.". As a bonus he has BB-8 on his ship beeping in a vaugely happy or scared way! And as unrealistic as ever the laser beams magically hit all the ships but Po's! Po swoops in for and unrealistic blowing up of Starkiller Base. Oh I'm sorry you said you needed a BIGGER Death Star. Come on J.J. Abrams. Star Wars is worth like a billion dollars. You can afford to buy a better idea then a bigger Death Star. And then they're trying to find that missing puzzle piece to find none other than... LUKE SKYWALKER!!! They find him Rey gives him the lightsaber and the movie ends. They magically blow up Starkiller Base and coincidentally they also find the last puzzle piece!<br>Now if you don't agree with me screw you. I hated this movie and I urge you to join me to hate The Force Awakens. People who hate the Last Jedi I'm with you 100%. I hate the Last Jedi. I wrote a rant for that too. But I am so sorry The Force Awakens is THE WORST movie of all time., 0.5,  Hamilton R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977165094/, March 14 2018, N/A

 The Force Awakens is a welcome return to the lived-in universe of the well-loved original trilogy. The characters are engaging the visuals are stunning and the story adeptly balances the old and the new. However the film suffers from a rehashed plot that lifts elements from A New Hope and essentially recrafts them sometimes to a fault. Though derivative TFA's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses.

 The Force Awakens is a welcome return to the lived-in universe of the well-loved original trilogy. The characters are engaging the visuals are stunning and the story adeptly balances the old and the new. However the film suffers from a rehashed plot that lifts elements from A New Hope and essentially recrafts them sometimes to a fault. Though derivative TFA's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. The film manages even in the face of unprecedented hype to recapture the boundless energy that embodied the originals and was so lacking in the prequels. The Force has awakened and it's here to stay., 3.5,  Scott M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/972643831/, March 13 2018, N/A
 It has been a few years since this abomination came out. But I recently wrote a review for TLJ and I am probably going to write a review for the other SW films. But this one in particular is a horrid excuse for a film. <br><br>I will explain. First this nothing but a rehash of episode 4. But more creatively bankrupt and disgusting. And it irritates me to no end when I see/n the "apologists" for this crap over the years. The excuses that pour out of these morons are putrid! Like<br><br>"they needed to rehash it because they wanted to bring fans back that didn't like the prequels!"<br>"It needed to be done to show that SW can be exciting!" <br>"they needed to reboot it for the newer generations benefit!" <br><br><br>Even Jar Jar Abrams has admitted to rehashing it. So he basically said the he had to "play it safe" to get fans back. Uh...NO! When I see morons say how they had to "play it safe" they are just admitting that they love laziness and used ideas. Well you got another OT now you whiny rejects. Are you happy with the same crap over and over? Never mind you are! And when or if episode 10 rolls around I am very positive that they will have another trilogy of rebels vs the mighty empire. Because it is obvious that all these morons want is more of the same. <br><br>I could go on but my point is that the "apologists" bend over backwards to excuse laziness. The only obligation they had to do was to make a sequel to ROTJ. But the idiots that enjoy this drivel like being patronized by a corporate entity. They basically tried to "buy" fans back by giving them reheated left overs and calling it "new." These people who bought into it are pathetic! <br><br>Disney and LFL basically were selling the new generation used experiences. Like "hey kids? Do you want to feel the way your parents felt when the first seen SW?" This is basically robbing the newer generation of their OWN authentic experiences. That is pretty low. But since Disney and LFL apparently have no balls they just gave the world the OT 2.0. And the idiots just fell in love with the same old stuff. Some for the first time and some for the second time. With how TLJ came out they don't really do original all too well. <br><br><br>But the biggest issue for me was how they treated the force in this. MaRey Sue uses the force with 0 training. That is right. 0 training! I did pay attention to the film though. As many who claim to "love" it have not. Because it took me all but one line of dialogue to figure this out. <br><br>Kylo Ren to Snoke: She is UNTRAINED! But stronger then she knows! <br><br>See? One line of dialogue. Did that stop all the "Reytards" from wasting 2 years thinking up every excuse to try to explain how she did what she did? Nope. I had to argue for those 2 years telling these cretins that she was untrained . If they actually paid attention they wouldn't have made themselves look like tools making excuses when it was spelled out for them in the film. <br><br><br>And nice what they did to Han eh? He went back to being a smuggler. But he also became a dead beat dad too! Then killed by his own son. After knowing his son had "too much Vader" in him Han tries to talk him into coming home like he was a 10 year old that was mad because he didn't want to leave the arcade. But Han knew he wasn't coming home and I guess he got what he knew he would get. <br><br><br>And then General Leia. She was a general in the OT and also in the ST. Now that is character development right there.../S<br><br><br>Finn is the worst character in the SW universe. Well he is tied with Rose now. But in TFA he basically gets shell shock on his first mission without even firing a shot. And then he wants to run from the FO because?...Reasons? I guess this is where the new books have to be taken into account. That is what the fans of this drek seem to tell you when something doesn't get explained. You basically need a manual to watch a movie now with these new ones. I know he didn't want to kill for the FO anymore. Not that he ever did in the first place. Because Jakku was his first mission. But he will kill for anyone else without thinking twice. <br><br><br>Then we have Maz. She was the one in all her infinite wisdom to yell out "HAN SOLO!" in a crowded bar knowing he has a a price on his head and also brings BB-8 with him knowing the FO is looking for it. But back to Maz. When they are sitting at the table talking she tells all of them that they must fight the FO! Then the FO brings the fight to her doorstep. And where is big game talking Maz? Oh yeah she is hiding away somewhere. <br><br><br>But this has been long enough already. I am pretty bored just thinking about TFA. Garbage movie for garbage lovers! Oh and these new Disney movies are made for the "Veruca Salt" generation. The "I want it now" ones.<br><br>"Real sets! Practical and tangible sets"...Blah blah blah! It is hillariious how some morons bought into this. TFA was a CGI fest covered turd and the idiots bought it. Disney and co. lied to your faces! They basically bent you over and had their way with you and since you are drones you took it all and asked for seconds. SMFH... So how did all that "going back to the old school" BS work out for ya?

Also an example of the plot being slapped together is how Rey somehow is a badass overnight when in the past we see Luke Skywalker and even the badass Darth Vader spent years mastering their skills and abilities.

 Capturing the old Star Wars vibe cantina and all this movie continues the saga with an amazing start. Rey played by Daisy Ridley steals the show in this film followed in a close second by Harrison Ford's Han Solo the same as ever. Adam Driver and John Boyega also deliver some good performances as side characters in the movie but they play their roles very well.

 Where do I begin? For one I don't like any Star Wars at all. Unfortunately my wife is a huge fan so I have seen all of them. But the one movie that stood out from all was this The Force Awakens. It starts out with a brand-new droid who is supposed to be cute but is really just two spheres stacked up on each other. Kylo-Ren isn't a good villian. That is one god-ugly mask he has and. Kylo-Ren's ugly pale face is supposed to look evil. He looks like a nerd before a math test. And then as we learn in The Last Jedi he survived! Rey practically chopped off every body part he had. Now lets start with Rey. I mean I get the girl power stuff and everything. I get that a strong female character is what you should promote in a male-dominate country like the U.S.A (cough cough no female president. we elect cheese puffs instead.) But seriously? Flying the Millenium Falcon with no training? Beating a experienced fighter like Kylo-Ren on your first try lightsabering? I'm sorry but thats taking it a wee bit to far. Then there is Han Solo. I know that was supposed to make you cry because you know he commited patricide and its frickin' Han Solo. I was mad. Han Solo is the greatest Star Wars character of all time (behind Darth Vader of course!) and you just plain kill him off like THAT! He did NOTHING heroic he didn't even hold a lightsaber until Kylo-Ren stuck it through his chest. Then there's Finn. I understand Star Wars need to have a black guy in their movies because most characters are middle-aged white guys like our favorite character Kylo-Ren! But honestly Finn just dosen't have that many action moments and isn't that great a character. Then there is Po. Po has a huge ego as is confirmed in The Last Jedi. My impression of him is this: "Hi I'm Po. I'm better than all of you. I should be commander because I'm a white middle-aged guy.". As a bonus he has BB-8 on his ship beeping in a vaugely happy or scared way! And as unrealistic as ever the laser beams magically hit all the ships but Po's! Po swoops in for and unrealistic blowing up of Starkiller Base. Oh I'm sorry you said you needed a BIGGER Death Star. Come on J.J. Abrams. Star Wars is worth like a billion dollars. You can afford to buy a better idea then a bigger Death Star. And then they're trying to find that missing puzzle piece to find none other than... LUKE SKYWALKER!!! They find him Rey gives him the lightsaber and the movie ends. They magically blow up Starkiller Base and coincidentally they also find the last puzzle piece!<br>Now if you don't agree with me screw you. I hated this movie and I urge you to join me to hate The Force Awakens. People who hate the Last Jedi I'm with you 100%. I hate the Last Jedi. I wrote a rant for that too.

 The Force Awakens is a welcome return to the lived-in universe of the well-loved original trilogy. The characters are engaging the visuals are stunning and the story adeptly balances the old and the new. However the film suffers from a rehashed plot that lifts elements from A New Hope and essentially recrafts them sometimes to a fault. Though derivative TFA's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. The film manages even in the face of unprecedented hype to recapture the boundless energy that embodied the originals and was so lacking in the prequels. The Force has awakened and it's here to stay., 3.5,  Scott M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/972643831/, March 13 2018, N/A
 It has been a few years since this abomination came out. But I recently wrote a review for TLJ and I am probably going to write a review for the other SW films. But this one in particular is a horrid excuse for a film. <br><br>I will explain. First this nothing but a rehash of episode 4. But more creatively bankrupt and disgusting. And it irritates me to no end when I see/n the "apologists" for this crap over the years. The excuses that pour out of these morons are putrid! Like<br><br>"they needed to rehash it because they wanted to bring fans back that didn't like the prequels!"<br>"It needed to be done to show that SW can be exciting!" <br>"they needed to reboot it for the newer generations benefit!" <br><br><br>Even Jar Jar Abrams has admitted to rehashing it. So he basically said the he had to "play it safe" to get fans back. Uh...NO! When I see morons say how they had to "play it safe" they are just admitting that they love laziness and used ideas. Well you got another OT now you whiny rejects. Are you happy with the same crap over and over? Never mind you are! And when or if episode 10 rolls around I am very positive that they will have another trilogy of rebels vs the mighty empire. Because it is obvious that all these morons want is more of the same. <br><br>I could go on but my point is that the "apologists" bend over backwards to excuse laziness. The only obligation they had to do was to make a sequel to ROTJ. But the idiots that enjoy this drivel like being patronized by a corporate entity. They basically tried to "buy" fans back by giving them reheated left overs and calling it "new." These people who bought into it are pathetic! <br><br>Disney and LFL basically were selling the new generation used experiences. Like "hey kids? Do you want to feel the way your parents felt when the first seen SW?" This is basically robbing the newer generation of their OWN authentic experiences. That is pretty low. But since Disney and LFL apparently have no balls they just gave the world the OT 2.0. And the idiots just fell in love with the same old stuff. Some for the first time and some for the second time. With how TLJ came out they don't really do original all too well. <br><br><br>But the biggest issue for me was how they treated the force in this. MaRey Sue uses the force with 0 training. That is right. 0 training! I did pay attention to the film though. As many who claim to "love" it have not. Because it took me all but one line of dialogue to figure this out. <br><br>Kylo Ren to Snoke: She is UNTRAINED! But stronger then she knows! <br><br>See? One line of dialogue. Did that stop all the "Reytards" from wasting 2 years thinking up every excuse to try to explain how she did what she did? Nope. I had to argue for those 2 years telling these cretins that she was untrained . If they actually paid attention they wouldn't have made themselves look like tools making excuses when it was spelled out for them in the film. <br><br><br>And nice what they did to Han eh? He went back to being a smuggler. But he also became a dead beat dad too! Then killed by his own son. After knowing his son had "too much Vader" in him Han tries to talk him into coming home like he was a 10 year old that was mad because he didn't want to leave the arcade. But Han knew he wasn't coming home and I guess he got what he knew he would get. <br><br><br>And then General Leia. She was a general in the OT and also in the ST. Now that is character development right there.../S<br><br><br>Finn is the worst character in the SW universe. Well he is tied with Rose now. But in TFA he basically gets shell shock on his first mission without even firing a shot. And then he wants to run from the FO because?...Reasons? I guess this is where the new books have to be taken into account. That is what the fans of this drek seem to tell you when something doesn't get explained. You basically need a manual to watch a movie now with these new ones. I know he didn't want to kill for the FO anymore. Not that he ever did in the first place. Because Jakku was his first mission. But he will kill for anyone else without thinking twice. <br><br><br>Then we have Maz. She was the one in all her infinite wisdom to yell out "HAN SOLO!" in a crowded bar knowing he has a a price on his head and also brings BB-8 with him knowing the FO is looking for it. But back to Maz. When they are sitting at the table talking she tells all of them that they must fight the FO! Then the FO brings the fight to her doorstep. And where is big game talking Maz? Oh yeah she is hiding away somewhere. <br><br><br>But this has been long enough already. I am pretty bored just thinking about TFA. Garbage movie for garbage lovers! Oh and these new Disney movies are made for the "Veruca Salt" generation. The "I want it now" ones.<br><br>"Real sets! Practical and tangible sets"...Blah blah blah! It is hillariious how some morons bought into this. TFA was a CGI fest covered turd and the idiots bought it. Disney and co. lied to your faces! They basically bent you over and had their way with you and since you are drones you took it all and asked for seconds. SMFH... So how did all that "going back to the old school" BS work out for ya?

 Where do I begin? For one I don't like any Star Wars at all. Unfortunately my wife is a huge fan so I have seen all of them. But the one movie that stood out from all was this The Force Awakens. It starts out with a brand-new droid who is supposed to be cute but is really just two spheres stacked up on each other. Kylo-Ren isn't a good villian. That is one god-ugly mask he has and. Kylo-Ren's ugly pale face is supposed to look evil. He looks like a nerd before a math test. And then as we learn in The Last Jedi he survived! Rey practically chopped off every body part he had. Now lets start with Rey. I mean I get the girl power stuff and everything. I get that a strong female character is what you should promote in a male-dominate country like the U.S.A (cough cough no female president. we elect cheese puffs instead.) But seriously? Flying the Millenium Falcon with no training? Beating a experienced fighter like Kylo-Ren on your first try lightsabering? I'm sorry but thats taking it a wee bit to far. Then there is Han Solo. I know that was supposed to make you cry because you know he commited patricide and its frickin' Han Solo. I was mad. Han Solo is the greatest Star Wars character of all time (behind Darth Vader of course!) and you just plain kill him off like THAT! He did NOTHING heroic he didn't even hold a lightsaber until Kylo-Ren stuck it through his chest. Then there's Finn. I understand Star Wars need to have a black guy in their movies because most characters are middle-aged white guys like our favorite character Kylo-Ren! But honestly Finn just dosen't have that many action moments and isn't that great a character. Then there is Po. Po has a huge ego as is confirmed in The Last Jedi. My impression of him is this: "Hi I'm Po. I'm better than all of you. I should be commander because I'm a white middle-aged guy.". As a bonus he has BB-8 on his ship beeping in a vaugely happy or scared way! And as unrealistic as ever the laser beams magically hit all the ships but Po's! Po swoops in for and unrealistic blowing up of Starkiller Base. Oh I'm sorry you said you needed a BIGGER Death Star. Come on J.J. Abrams. Star Wars is worth like a billion dollars. You can afford to buy a better idea then a bigger Death Star. And then they're trying to find that missing puzzle piece to find none other than... LUKE SKYWALKER!!! They find him Rey gives him the lightsaber and the movie ends. They magically blow up Starkiller Base and coincidentally they also find the last puzzle piece!<br>Now if you don't agree with me screw you.

As a bonus he has BB-8 on his ship beeping in a vaugely happy or scared way! And as unrealistic as ever the laser beams magically hit all the ships but Po's! Po swoops in for and unrealistic blowing up of Starkiller Base. Oh I'm sorry you said you needed a BIGGER Death Star. Come on J.J. Abrams. Star Wars is worth like a billion dollars. You can afford to buy a better idea then a bigger Death Star. And then they're trying to find that missing puzzle piece to find none other than... LUKE SKYWALKER!!! They find him Rey gives him the lightsaber and the movie ends. They magically blow up Starkiller Base and coincidentally they also find the last puzzle piece!<br>Now if you don't agree with me screw you. I hated this movie and I urge you to join me to hate The Force Awakens. People who hate the Last Jedi I'm with you 100%. I hate the Last Jedi. I wrote a rant for that too.

 The Force Awakens is a welcome return to the lived-in universe of the well-loved original trilogy. The characters are engaging the visuals are stunning and the story adeptly balances the old and the new. However the film suffers from a rehashed plot that lifts elements from A New Hope and essentially recrafts them sometimes to a fault. Though derivative TFA's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. The film manages even in the face of unprecedented hype to recapture the boundless energy that embodied the originals and was so lacking in the prequels. The Force has awakened and it's here to stay., 3.5,  Scott M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/972643831/, March 13 2018, N/A
 It has been a few years since this abomination came out. But I recently wrote a review for TLJ and I am probably going to write a review for the other SW films. But this one in particular is a horrid excuse for a film. <br><br>I will explain. First this nothing but a rehash of episode 4. But more creatively bankrupt and disgusting. And it irritates me to no end when I see/n the "apologists" for this crap over the years. The excuses that pour out of these morons are putrid! Like<br><br>"they needed to rehash it because they wanted to bring fans back that didn't like the prequels!"<br>"It needed to be done to show that SW can be exciting!" <br>"they needed to reboot it for the newer generations benefit!" <br><br><br>Even Jar Jar Abrams has admitted to rehashing it. So he basically said the he had to "play it safe" to get fans back. Uh...NO! When I see morons say how they had to "play it safe" they are just admitting that they love laziness and used ideas. Well you got another OT now you whiny rejects. Are you happy with the same crap over and over? Never mind you are! And when or if episode 10 rolls around I am very positive that they will have another trilogy of rebels vs the mighty empire. Because it is obvious that all these morons want is more of the same. <br><br>I could go on but my point is that the "apologists" bend over backwards to excuse laziness. The only obligation they had to do was to make a sequel to ROTJ. But the idiots that enjoy this drivel like being patronized by a corporate entity. They basically tried to "buy" fans back by giving them reheated left overs and calling it "new." These people who bought into it are pathetic! <br><br>Disney and LFL basically were selling the new generation used experiences. Like "hey kids? Do you want to feel the way your parents felt when the first seen SW?" This is basically robbing the newer generation of their OWN authentic experiences. That is pretty low. But since Disney and LFL apparently have no balls they just gave the world the OT 2.0. And the idiots just fell in love with the same old stuff. Some for the first time and some for the second time. With how TLJ came out they don't really do original all too well. <br><br><br>But the biggest issue for me was how they treated the force in this. MaRey Sue uses the force with 0 training. That is right. 0 training! I did pay attention to the film though. As many who claim to "love" it have not. Because it took me all but one line of dialogue to figure this out. <br><br>Kylo Ren to Snoke: She is UNTRAINED! But stronger then she knows! <br><br>See? One line of dialogue. Did that stop all the "Reytards" from wasting 2 years thinking up every excuse to try to explain how she did what she did? Nope. I had to argue for those 2 years telling these cretins that she was untrained . If they actually paid attention they wouldn't have made themselves look like tools making excuses when it was spelled out for them in the film. <br><br><br>And nice what they did to Han eh? He went back to being a smuggler. But he also became a dead beat dad too! Then killed by his own son. After knowing his son had "too much Vader" in him Han tries to talk him into coming home like he was a 10 year old that was mad because he didn't want to leave the arcade. But Han knew he wasn't coming home and I guess he got what he knew he would get. <br><br><br>And then General Leia. She was a general in the OT and also in the ST. Now that is character development right there.../S<br><br><br>Finn is the worst character in the SW universe. Well he is tied with Rose now. But in TFA he basically gets shell shock on his first mission without even firing a shot. And then he wants to run from the FO because?...Reasons? I guess this is where the new books have to be taken into account. That is what the fans of this drek seem to tell you when something doesn't get explained. You basically need a manual to watch a movie now with these new ones. I know he didn't want to kill for the FO anymore. Not that he ever did in the first place. Because Jakku was his first mission. But he will kill for anyone else without thinking twice. <br><br><br>Then we have Maz. She was the one in all her infinite wisdom to yell out "HAN SOLO!" in a crowded bar knowing he has a a price on his head and also brings BB-8 with him knowing the FO is looking for it. But back to Maz. When they are sitting at the table talking she tells all of them that they must fight the FO! Then the FO brings the fight to her doorstep. And where is big game talking Maz? Oh yeah she is hiding away somewhere. <br><br><br>But this has been long enough already. I am pretty bored just thinking about TFA. Garbage movie for garbage lovers! Oh and these new Disney movies are made for the "Veruca Salt" generation. The "I want it now" ones.<br><br>"Real sets! Practical and tangible sets"...Blah blah blah! It is hillariious how some morons bought into this. TFA was a CGI fest covered turd and the idiots bought it. Disney and co. lied to your faces! They basically bent you over and had their way with you and since you are drones you took it all and asked for seconds. SMFH... So how did all that "going back to the old school" BS work out for ya?

Adam Driver and John Boyega also deliver some good performances as side characters in the movie but they play their roles very well.

 Where do I begin? For one I don't like any Star Wars at all. Unfortunately my wife is a huge fan so I have seen all of them. But the one movie that stood out from all was this The Force Awakens. It starts out with a brand-new droid who is supposed to be cute but is really just two spheres stacked up on each other. Kylo-Ren isn't a good villian. That is one god-ugly mask he has and. Kylo-Ren's ugly pale face is supposed to look evil. He looks like a nerd before a math test. And then as we learn in The Last Jedi he survived! Rey practically chopped off every body part he had. Now lets start with Rey. I mean I get the girl power stuff and everything. I get that a strong female character is what you should promote in a male-dominate country like the U.S.A (cough cough no female president. we elect cheese puffs instead.) But seriously? Flying the Millenium Falcon with no training? Beating a experienced fighter like Kylo-Ren on your first try lightsabering? I'm sorry but thats taking it a wee bit to far. Then there is Han Solo. I know that was supposed to make you cry because you know he commited patricide and its frickin' Han Solo. I was mad. Han Solo is the greatest Star Wars character of all time (behind Darth Vader of course!) and you just plain kill him off like THAT! He did NOTHING heroic he didn't even hold a lightsaber until Kylo-Ren stuck it through his chest. Then there's Finn. I understand Star Wars need to have a black guy in their movies because most characters are middle-aged white guys like our favorite character Kylo-Ren! But honestly Finn just dosen't have that many action moments and isn't that great a character. Then there is Po. Po has a huge ego as is confirmed in The Last Jedi. My impression of him is this: "Hi I'm Po. I'm better than all of you. I should be commander because I'm a white middle-aged guy.". As a bonus he has BB-8 on his ship beeping in a vaugely happy or scared way! And as unrealistic as ever the laser beams magically hit all the ships but Po's! Po swoops in for and unrealistic blowing up of Starkiller Base. Oh I'm sorry you said you needed a BIGGER Death Star. Come on J.J. Abrams. Star Wars is worth like a billion dollars.

Han Solo is the greatest Star Wars character of all time (behind Darth Vader of course!) and you just plain kill him off like THAT! He did NOTHING heroic he didn't even hold a lightsaber until Kylo-Ren stuck it through his chest. Then there's Finn. I understand Star Wars need to have a black guy in their movies because most characters are middle-aged white guys like our favorite character Kylo-Ren! But honestly Finn just dosen't have that many action moments and isn't that great a character. Then there is Po. Po has a huge ego as is confirmed in The Last Jedi. My impression of him is this: "Hi I'm Po. I'm better than all of you. I should be commander because I'm a white middle-aged guy.". As a bonus he has BB-8 on his ship beeping in a vaugely happy or scared way! And as unrealistic as ever the laser beams magically hit all the ships but Po's! Po swoops in for and unrealistic blowing up of Starkiller Base. Oh I'm sorry you said you needed a BIGGER Death Star. Come on J.J. Abrams. Star Wars is worth like a billion dollars. You can afford to buy a better idea then a bigger Death Star. And then they're trying to find that missing puzzle piece to find none other than... LUKE SKYWALKER!!! They find him Rey gives him the lightsaber and the movie ends. They magically blow up Starkiller Base and coincidentally they also find the last puzzle piece!<br>Now if you don't agree with me screw you. I hated this movie and I urge you to join me to hate The Force Awakens. People who hate the Last Jedi I'm with you 100%. I hate the Last Jedi. I wrote a rant for that too.

 The Force Awakens is a welcome return to the lived-in universe of the well-loved original trilogy. The characters are engaging the visuals are stunning and the story adeptly balances the old and the new. However the film suffers from a rehashed plot that lifts elements from A New Hope and essentially recrafts them sometimes to a fault. Though derivative TFA's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. The film manages even in the face of unprecedented hype to recapture the boundless energy that embodied the originals and was so lacking in the prequels. The Force has awakened and it's here to stay., 3.5,  Scott M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/972643831/, March 13 2018, N/A
 It has been a few years since this abomination came out. But I recently wrote a review for TLJ and I am probably going to write a review for the other SW films. But this one in particular is a horrid excuse for a film. <br><br>I will explain. First this nothing but a rehash of episode 4. But more creatively bankrupt and disgusting. And it irritates me to no end when I see/n the "apologists" for this crap over the years. The excuses that pour out of these morons are putrid! Like<br><br>"they needed to rehash it because they wanted to bring fans back that didn't like the prequels!"<br>"It needed to be done to show that SW can be exciting!" <br>"they needed to reboot it for the newer generations benefit!" <br><br><br>Even Jar Jar Abrams has admitted to rehashing it. So he basically said the he had to "play it safe" to get fans back. Uh...NO! When I see morons say how they had to "play it safe" they are just admitting that they love laziness and used ideas. Well you got another OT now you whiny rejects. Are you happy with the same crap over and over? Never mind you are! And when or if episode 10 rolls around I am very positive that they will have another trilogy of rebels vs the mighty empire. Because it is obvious that all these morons want is more of the same. <br><br>I could go on but my point is that the "apologists" bend over backwards to excuse laziness. The only obligation they had to do was to make a sequel to ROTJ. But the idiots that enjoy this drivel like being patronized by a corporate entity. They basically tried to "buy" fans back by giving them reheated left overs and calling it "new." These people who bought into it are pathetic! <br><br>Disney and LFL basically were selling the new generation used experiences. Like "hey kids? Do you want to feel the way your parents felt when the first seen SW?" This is basically robbing the newer generation of their OWN authentic experiences. That is pretty low. But since Disney and LFL apparently have no balls they just gave the world the OT 2.0. And the idiots just fell in love with the same old stuff. Some for the first time and some for the second time. With how TLJ came out they don't really do original all too well. <br><br><br>But the biggest issue for me was how they treated the force in this. MaRey Sue uses the force with 0 training. That is right. 0 training! I did pay attention to the film though. As many who claim to "love" it have not. Because it took me all but one line of dialogue to figure this out. <br><br>Kylo Ren to Snoke: She is UNTRAINED! But stronger then she knows! <br><br>See? One line of dialogue. Did that stop all the "Reytards" from wasting 2 years thinking up every excuse to try to explain how she did what she did? Nope. I had to argue for those 2 years telling these cretins that she was untrained . If they actually paid attention they wouldn't have made themselves look like tools making excuses when it was spelled out for them in the film. <br><br><br>And nice what they did to Han eh? He went back to being a smuggler. But he also became a dead beat dad too! Then killed by his own son. After knowing his son had "too much Vader" in him Han tries to talk him into coming home like he was a 10 year old that was mad because he didn't want to leave the arcade. But Han knew he wasn't coming home and I guess he got what he knew he would get. <br><br><br>And then General Leia. She was a general in the OT and also in the ST. Now that is character development right there.../S<br><br><br>Finn is the worst character in the SW universe. Well he is tied with Rose now. But in TFA he basically gets shell shock on his first mission without even firing a shot. And then he wants to run from the FO because?...Reasons? I guess this is where the new books have to be taken into account. That is what the fans of this drek seem to tell you when something doesn't get explained. You basically need a manual to watch a movie now with these new ones. I know he didn't want to kill for the FO anymore. Not that he ever did in the first place. Because Jakku was his first mission. But he will kill for anyone else without thinking twice. <br><br><br>Then we have Maz. She was the one in all her infinite wisdom to yell out "HAN SOLO!" in a crowded bar knowing he has a a price on his head and also brings BB-8 with him knowing the FO is looking for it. But back to Maz. When they are sitting at the table talking she tells all of them that they must fight the FO! Then the FO brings the fight to her doorstep. And where is big game talking Maz? Oh yeah she is hiding away somewhere. <br><br><br>But this has been long enough already. I am pretty bored just thinking about TFA. Garbage movie for garbage lovers! Oh and these new Disney movies are made for the "Veruca Salt" generation. The "I want it now" ones.<br><br>"Real sets! Practical and tangible sets"...Blah blah blah! It is hillariious how some morons bought into this. TFA was a CGI fest covered turd and the idiots bought it. Disney and co. lied to your faces! They basically bent you over and had their way with you and since you are drones you took it all and asked for seconds. SMFH... So how did all that "going back to the old school" BS work out for ya?

 Where do I begin? For one I don't like any Star Wars at all. Unfortunately my wife is a huge fan so I have seen all of them. But the one movie that stood out from all was this The Force Awakens. It starts out with a brand-new droid who is supposed to be cute but is really just two spheres stacked up on each other. Kylo-Ren isn't a good villian. That is one god-ugly mask he has and. Kylo-Ren's ugly pale face is supposed to look evil. He looks like a nerd before a math test. And then as we learn in The Last Jedi he survived! Rey practically chopped off every body part he had. Now lets start with Rey. I mean I get the girl power stuff and everything. I get that a strong female character is what you should promote in a male-dominate country like the U.S.A (cough cough no female president. we elect cheese puffs instead.) But seriously? Flying the Millenium Falcon with no training? Beating a experienced fighter like Kylo-Ren on your first try lightsabering? I'm sorry but thats taking it a wee bit to far. Then there is Han Solo. I know that was supposed to make you cry because you know he commited patricide and its frickin' Han Solo. I was mad. Han Solo is the greatest Star Wars character of all time (behind Darth Vader of course!) and you just plain kill him off like THAT!

Kylo-Ren's ugly pale face is supposed to look evil. He looks like a nerd before a math test. And then as we learn in The Last Jedi he survived! Rey practically chopped off every body part he had. Now lets start with Rey. I mean I get the girl power stuff and everything. I get that a strong female character is what you should promote in a male-dominate country like the U.S.A (cough cough no female president. we elect cheese puffs instead.) But seriously? Flying the Millenium Falcon with no training? Beating a experienced fighter like Kylo-Ren on your first try lightsabering? I'm sorry but thats taking it a wee bit to far. Then there is Han Solo. I know that was supposed to make you cry because you know he commited patricide and its frickin' Han Solo. I was mad. Han Solo is the greatest Star Wars character of all time (behind Darth Vader of course!) and you just plain kill him off like THAT! He did NOTHING heroic he didn't even hold a lightsaber until Kylo-Ren stuck it through his chest. Then there's Finn. I understand Star Wars need to have a black guy in their movies because most characters are middle-aged white guys like our favorite character Kylo-Ren! But honestly Finn just dosen't have that many action moments and isn't that great a character. Then there is Po. Po has a huge ego as is confirmed in The Last Jedi. My impression of him is this: "Hi I'm Po. I'm better than all of you. I should be commander because I'm a white middle-aged guy.". As a bonus he has BB-8 on his ship beeping in a vaugely happy or scared way! And as unrealistic as ever the laser beams magically hit all the ships but Po's! Po swoops in for and unrealistic blowing up of Starkiller Base. Oh I'm sorry you said you needed a BIGGER Death Star. Come on J.J. Abrams. Star Wars is worth like a billion dollars. You can afford to buy a better idea then a bigger Death Star. And then they're trying to find that missing puzzle piece to find none other than... LUKE SKYWALKER!!! They find him Rey gives him the lightsaber and the movie ends. They magically blow up Starkiller Base and coincidentally they also find the last puzzle piece!<br>Now if you don't agree with me screw you. I hated this movie and I urge you to join me to hate The Force Awakens. People who hate the Last Jedi I'm with you 100%. I hate the Last Jedi. I wrote a rant for that too. But I am so sorry The Force Awakens is THE WORST movie of all time., 0.5,  Hamilton R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977165094/, March 14 2018, N/A

 The Force Awakens is a welcome return to the lived-in universe of the well-loved original trilogy. The characters are engaging the visuals are stunning and the story adeptly balances the old and the new. However the film suffers from a rehashed plot that lifts elements from A New Hope and essentially recrafts them sometimes to a fault. Though derivative TFA's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. The film manages even in the face of unprecedented hype to recapture the boundless energy that embodied the originals and was so lacking in the prequels. The Force has awakened and it's here to stay., 3.5,  Scott M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/972643831/, March 13 2018, N/A
 It has been a few years since this abomination came out. But I recently wrote a review for TLJ and I am probably going to write a review for the other SW films. But this one in particular is a horrid excuse for a film. <br><br>I will explain. First this nothing but a rehash of episode 4. But more creatively bankrupt and disgusting. And it irritates me to no end when I see/n the "apologists" for this crap over the years. The excuses that pour out of these morons are putrid! Like<br><br>"they needed to rehash it because they wanted to bring fans back that didn't like the prequels!"<br>"It needed to be done to show that SW can be exciting!" <br>"they needed to reboot it for the newer generations benefit!" <br><br><br>Even Jar Jar Abrams has admitted to rehashing it. So he basically said the he had to "play it safe" to get fans back. Uh...NO! When I see morons say how they had to "play it safe" they are just admitting that they love laziness and used ideas. Well you got another OT now you whiny rejects. Are you happy with the same crap over and over? Never mind you are! And when or if episode 10 rolls around I am very positive that they will have another trilogy of rebels vs the mighty empire. Because it is obvious that all these morons want is more of the same. <br><br>I could go on but my point is that the "apologists" bend over backwards to excuse laziness. The only obligation they had to do was to make a sequel to ROTJ. But the idiots that enjoy this drivel like being patronized by a corporate entity. They basically tried to "buy" fans back by giving them reheated left overs and calling it "new." These people who bought into it are pathetic! <br><br>Disney and LFL basically were selling the new generation used experiences. Like "hey kids? Do you want to feel the way your parents felt when the first seen SW?" This is basically robbing the newer generation of their OWN authentic experiences. That is pretty low. But since Disney and LFL apparently have no balls they just gave the world the OT 2.0. And the idiots just fell in love with the same old stuff. Some for the first time and some for the second time. With how TLJ came out they don't really do original all too well. <br><br><br>But the biggest issue for me was how they treated the force in this. MaRey Sue uses the force with 0 training. That is right. 0 training! I did pay attention to the film though. As many who claim to "love" it have not. Because it took me all but one line of dialogue to figure this out. <br><br>Kylo Ren to Snoke: She is UNTRAINED! But stronger then she knows! <br><br>See? One line of dialogue. Did that stop all the "Reytards" from wasting 2 years thinking up every excuse to try to explain how she did what she did? Nope. I had to argue for those 2 years telling these cretins that she was untrained . If they actually paid attention they wouldn't have made themselves look like tools making excuses when it was spelled out for them in the film. <br><br><br>And nice what they did to Han eh? He went back to being a smuggler. But he also became a dead beat dad too! Then killed by his own son. After knowing his son had "too much Vader" in him Han tries to talk him into coming home like he was a 10 year old that was mad because he didn't want to leave the arcade. But Han knew he wasn't coming home and I guess he got what he knew he would get. <br><br><br>And then General Leia. She was a general in the OT and also in the ST. Now that is character development right there.../S<br><br><br>Finn is the worst character in the SW universe. Well he is tied with Rose now. But in TFA he basically gets shell shock on his first mission without even firing a shot. And then he wants to run from the FO because?...Reasons? I guess this is where the new books have to be taken into account. That is what the fans of this drek seem to tell you when something doesn't get explained. You basically need a manual to watch a movie now with these new ones. I know he didn't want to kill for the FO anymore. Not that he ever did in the first place. Because Jakku was his first mission. But he will kill for anyone else without thinking twice. <br><br><br>Then we have Maz. She was the one in all her infinite wisdom to yell out "HAN SOLO!" in a crowded bar knowing he has a a price on his head and also brings BB-8 with him knowing the FO is looking for it. But back to Maz. When they are sitting at the table talking she tells all of them that they must fight the FO! Then the FO brings the fight to her doorstep. And where is big game talking Maz? Oh yeah she is hiding away somewhere. <br><br><br>But this has been long enough already. I am pretty bored just thinking about TFA. Garbage movie for garbage lovers! Oh and these new Disney movies are made for the "Veruca Salt" generation. The "I want it now" ones.<br><br>"Real sets! Practical and tangible sets"...Blah blah blah! It is hillariious how some morons bought into this. TFA was a CGI fest covered turd and the idiots bought it. Disney and co. lied to your faces! They basically bent you over and had their way with you and since you are drones you took it all and asked for seconds. SMFH... So how did all that "going back to the old school" BS work out for ya? I bet you are feeling mighty stupid right about now? Disney will keep on lying and the morons will keep buyin'!, 1.0,  Gabber C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977088517/, March 13 2018, N/A

Also an example of the plot being slapped together is how Rey somehow is a badass overnight when in the past we see Luke Skywalker and even the badass Darth Vader spent years mastering their skills and abilities.

 Where do I begin? For one I don't like any Star Wars at all. Unfortunately my wife is a huge fan so I have seen all of them. But the one movie that stood out from all was this The Force Awakens. It starts out with a brand-new droid who is supposed to be cute but is really just two spheres stacked up on each other. Kylo-Ren isn't a good villian. That is one god-ugly mask he has and. Kylo-Ren's ugly pale face is supposed to look evil. He looks like a nerd before a math test. And then as we learn in The Last Jedi he survived! Rey practically chopped off every body part he had. Now lets start with Rey. I mean I get the girl power stuff and everything. I get that a strong female character is what you should promote in a male-dominate country like the U.S.A (cough cough no female president. we elect cheese puffs instead.) But seriously? Flying the Millenium Falcon with no training? Beating a experienced fighter like Kylo-Ren on your first try lightsabering? I'm sorry but thats taking it a wee bit to far. Then there is Han Solo. I know that was supposed to make you cry because you know he commited patricide and its frickin' Han Solo. I was mad. Han Solo is the greatest Star Wars character of all time (behind Darth Vader of course!) and you just plain kill him off like THAT! He did NOTHING heroic he didn't even hold a lightsaber until Kylo-Ren stuck it through his chest. Then there's Finn. I understand Star Wars need to have a black guy in their movies because most characters are middle-aged white guys like our favorite character Kylo-Ren! But honestly Finn just dosen't have that many action moments and isn't that great a character. Then there is Po. Po has a huge ego as is confirmed in The Last Jedi. My impression of him is this: "Hi I'm Po. I'm better than all of you. I should be commander because I'm a white middle-aged guy.". As a bonus he has BB-8 on his ship beeping in a vaugely happy or scared way! And as unrealistic as ever the laser beams magically hit all the ships but Po's! Po swoops in for and unrealistic blowing up of Starkiller Base. Oh I'm sorry you said you needed a BIGGER Death Star. Come on J.J. Abrams. Star Wars is worth like a billion dollars. You can afford to buy a better idea then a bigger Death Star. And then they're trying to find that missing puzzle piece to find none other than... LUKE SKYWALKER!!! They find him Rey gives him the lightsaber and the movie ends. They magically blow up Starkiller Base and coincidentally they also find the last puzzle piece!<br>Now if you don't agree with me screw you. I hated this movie and I urge you to join me to hate The Force Awakens. People who hate the Last Jedi I'm with you 100%. I hate the Last Jedi. I wrote a rant for that too. But I am so sorry The Force Awakens is THE WORST movie of all time., 0.5,  Hamilton R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977165094/, March 14 2018, N/A

 The Force Awakens is a welcome return to the lived-in universe of the well-loved original trilogy. The characters are engaging the visuals are stunning and the story adeptly balances the old and the new. However the film suffers from a rehashed plot that lifts elements from A New Hope and essentially recrafts them sometimes to a fault. Though derivative TFA's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. The film manages even in the face of unprecedented hype to recapture the boundless energy that embodied the originals and was so lacking in the prequels. The Force has awakened and it's here to stay., 3.5,  Scott M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/972643831/, March 13 2018, N/A
 It has been a few years since this abomination came out. But I recently wrote a review for TLJ and I am probably going to write a review for the other SW films. But this one in particular is a horrid excuse for a film. <br><br>I will explain. First this nothing but a rehash of episode 4. But more creatively bankrupt and disgusting. And it irritates me to no end when I see/n the "apologists" for this crap over the years. The excuses that pour out of these morons are putrid! Like<br><br>"they needed to rehash it because they wanted to bring fans back that didn't like the prequels!"<br>"It needed to be done to show that SW can be exciting!" <br>"they needed to reboot it for the newer generations benefit!" <br><br><br>Even Jar Jar Abrams has admitted to rehashing it. So he basically said the he had to "play it safe" to get fans back. Uh...NO! When I see morons say how they had to "play it safe" they are just admitting that they love laziness and used ideas. Well you got another OT now you whiny rejects. Are you happy with the same crap over and over? Never mind you are! And when or if episode 10 rolls around I am very positive that they will have another trilogy of rebels vs the mighty empire. Because it is obvious that all these morons want is more of the same. <br><br>I could go on but my point is that the "apologists" bend over backwards to excuse laziness. The only obligation they had to do was to make a sequel to ROTJ. But the idiots that enjoy this drivel like being patronized by a corporate entity. They basically tried to "buy" fans back by giving them reheated left overs and calling it "new." These people who bought into it are pathetic! <br><br>Disney and LFL basically were selling the new generation used experiences. Like "hey kids? Do you want to feel the way your parents felt when the first seen SW?" This is basically robbing the newer generation of their OWN authentic experiences. That is pretty low. But since Disney and LFL apparently have no balls they just gave the world the OT 2.0. And the idiots just fell in love with the same old stuff. Some for the first time and some for the second time. With how TLJ came out they don't really do original all too well. <br><br><br>But the biggest issue for me was how they treated the force in this. MaRey Sue uses the force with 0 training. That is right. 0 training! I did pay attention to the film though. As many who claim to "love" it have not. Because it took me all but one line of dialogue to figure this out. <br><br>Kylo Ren to Snoke: She is UNTRAINED! But stronger then she knows! <br><br>See? One line of dialogue. Did that stop all the "Reytards" from wasting 2 years thinking up every excuse to try to explain how she did what she did? Nope. I had to argue for those 2 years telling these cretins that she was untrained . If they actually paid attention they wouldn't have made themselves look like tools making excuses when it was spelled out for them in the film. <br><br><br>And nice what they did to Han eh? He went back to being a smuggler. But he also became a dead beat dad too! Then killed by his own son. After knowing his son had "too much Vader" in him Han tries to talk him into coming home like he was a 10 year old that was mad because he didn't want to leave the arcade. But Han knew he wasn't coming home and I guess he got what he knew he would get. <br><br><br>And then General Leia. She was a general in the OT and also in the ST. Now that is character development right there.../S<br><br><br>Finn is the worst character in the SW universe. Well he is tied with Rose now. But in TFA he basically gets shell shock on his first mission without even firing a shot. And then he wants to run from the FO because?...Reasons? I guess this is where the new books have to be taken into account. That is what the fans of this drek seem to tell you when something doesn't get explained. You basically need a manual to watch a movie now with these new ones. I know he didn't want to kill for the FO anymore. Not that he ever did in the first place. Because Jakku was his first mission. But he will kill for anyone else without thinking twice. <br><br><br>Then we have Maz. She was the one in all her infinite wisdom to yell out "HAN SOLO!" in a crowded bar knowing he has a a price on his head and also brings BB-8 with him knowing the FO is looking for it. But back to Maz. When they are sitting at the table talking she tells all of them that they must fight the FO! Then the FO brings the fight to her doorstep. And where is big game talking Maz? Oh yeah she is hiding away somewhere. <br><br><br>But this has been long enough already. I am pretty bored just thinking about TFA. Garbage movie for garbage lovers! Oh and these new Disney movies are made for the "Veruca Salt" generation. The "I want it now" ones.<br><br>"Real sets! Practical and tangible sets"...Blah blah blah! It is hillariious how some morons bought into this. TFA was a CGI fest covered turd and the idiots bought it. Disney and co. lied to your faces! They basically bent you over and had their way with you and since you are drones you took it all and asked for seconds. SMFH... So how did all that "going back to the old school" BS work out for ya?

 Capturing the old Star Wars vibe cantina and all this movie continues the saga with an amazing start. Rey played by Daisy Ridley steals the show in this film followed in a close second by Harrison Ford's Han Solo the same as ever. Adam Driver and John Boyega also deliver some good performances as side characters in the movie but they play their roles very well. Oscaar Isaac has a very small role in this and while it is small he is very noteworthy in those moments. I highly recommend this movie to any Star Wars fan and casual movie goer., 4.0,  Josh K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/931853787/, March 16 2018, N/A

 Where do I begin? For one I don't like any Star Wars at all. Unfortunately my wife is a huge fan so I have seen all of them. But the one movie that stood out from all was this The Force Awakens. It starts out with a brand-new droid who is supposed to be cute but is really just two spheres stacked up on each other. Kylo-Ren isn't a good villian. That is one god-ugly mask he has and. Kylo-Ren's ugly pale face is supposed to look evil. He looks like a nerd before a math test. And then as we learn in The Last Jedi he survived! Rey practically chopped off every body part he had. Now lets start with Rey. I mean I get the girl power stuff and everything. I get that a strong female character is what you should promote in a male-dominate country like the U.S.A (cough cough no female president. we elect cheese puffs instead.) But seriously? Flying the Millenium Falcon with no training? Beating a experienced fighter like Kylo-Ren on your first try lightsabering? I'm sorry but thats taking it a wee bit to far. Then there is Han Solo. I know that was supposed to make you cry because you know he commited patricide and its frickin' Han Solo. I was mad. Han Solo is the greatest Star Wars character of all time (behind Darth Vader of course!) and you just plain kill him off like THAT! He did NOTHING heroic he didn't even hold a lightsaber until Kylo-Ren stuck it through his chest. Then there's Finn. I understand Star Wars need to have a black guy in their movies because most characters are middle-aged white guys like our favorite character Kylo-Ren! But honestly Finn just dosen't have that many action moments and isn't that great a character. Then there is Po. Po has a huge ego as is confirmed in The Last Jedi. My impression of him is this: "Hi I'm Po. I'm better than all of you. I should be commander because I'm a white middle-aged guy.". As a bonus he has BB-8 on his ship beeping in a vaugely happy or scared way! And as unrealistic as ever the laser beams magically hit all the ships but Po's! Po swoops in for and unrealistic blowing up of Starkiller Base. Oh I'm sorry you said you needed a BIGGER Death Star. Come on J.J. Abrams. Star Wars is worth like a billion dollars. You can afford to buy a better idea then a bigger Death Star. And then they're trying to find that missing puzzle piece to find none other than... LUKE SKYWALKER!!! They find him Rey gives him the lightsaber and the movie ends. They magically blow up Starkiller Base and coincidentally they also find the last puzzle piece!<br>Now if you don't agree with me screw you. I hated this movie and I urge you to join me to hate The Force Awakens. People who hate the Last Jedi I'm with you 100%. I hate the Last Jedi. I wrote a rant for that too. But I am so sorry The Force Awakens is THE WORST movie of all time., 0.5,  Hamilton R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977165094/, March 14 2018, N/A

 The Force Awakens is a welcome return to the lived-in universe of the well-loved original trilogy. The characters are engaging the visuals are stunning and the story adeptly balances the old and the new. However the film suffers from a rehashed plot that lifts elements from A New Hope and essentially recrafts them sometimes to a fault. Though derivative TFA's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. The film manages even in the face of unprecedented hype to recapture the boundless energy that embodied the originals and was so lacking in the prequels. The Force has awakened and it's here to stay., 3.5,  Scott M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/972643831/, March 13 2018, N/A
 It has been a few years since this abomination came out. But I recently wrote a review for TLJ and I am probably going to write a review for the other SW films. But this one in particular is a horrid excuse for a film. <br><br>I will explain. First this nothing but a rehash of episode 4. But more creatively bankrupt and disgusting. And it irritates me to no end when I see/n the "apologists" for this crap over the years. The excuses that pour out of these morons are putrid! Like<br><br>"they needed to rehash it because they wanted to bring fans back that didn't like the prequels!"<br>"It needed to be done to show that SW can be exciting!" <br>"they needed to reboot it for the newer generations benefit!" <br><br><br>Even Jar Jar Abrams has admitted to rehashing it. So he basically said the he had to "play it safe" to get fans back. Uh...NO! When I see morons say how they had to "play it safe" they are just admitting that they love laziness and used ideas. Well you got another OT now you whiny rejects. Are you happy with the same crap over and over? Never mind you are! And when or if episode 10 rolls around I am very positive that they will have another trilogy of rebels vs the mighty empire. Because it is obvious that all these morons want is more of the same. <br><br>I could go on but my point is that the "apologists" bend over backwards to excuse laziness. The only obligation they had to do was to make a sequel to ROTJ. But the idiots that enjoy this drivel like being patronized by a corporate entity. They basically tried to "buy" fans back by giving them reheated left overs and calling it "new." These people who bought into it are pathetic! <br><br>Disney and LFL basically were selling the new generation used experiences. Like "hey kids? Do you want to feel the way your parents felt when the first seen SW?" This is basically robbing the newer generation of their OWN authentic experiences. That is pretty low. But since Disney and LFL apparently have no balls they just gave the world the OT 2.0. And the idiots just fell in love with the same old stuff. Some for the first time and some for the second time. With how TLJ came out they don't really do original all too well. <br><br><br>But the biggest issue for me was how they treated the force in this. MaRey Sue uses the force with 0 training. That is right. 0 training! I did pay attention to the film though. As many who claim to "love" it have not. Because it took me all but one line of dialogue to figure this out. <br><br>Kylo Ren to Snoke: She is UNTRAINED! But stronger then she knows! <br><br>See? One line of dialogue. Did that stop all the "Reytards" from wasting 2 years thinking up every excuse to try to explain how she did what she did? Nope. I had to argue for those 2 years telling these cretins that she was untrained . If they actually paid attention they wouldn't have made themselves look like tools making excuses when it was spelled out for them in the film. <br><br><br>And nice what they did to Han eh? He went back to being a smuggler. But he also became a dead beat dad too! Then killed by his own son. After knowing his son had "too much Vader" in him Han tries to talk him into coming home like he was a 10 year old that was mad because he didn't want to leave the arcade. But Han knew he wasn't coming home and I guess he got what he knew he would get. <br><br><br>And then General Leia. She was a general in the OT and also in the ST. Now that is character development right there.../S<br><br><br>Finn is the worst character in the SW universe. Well he is tied with Rose now. But in TFA he basically gets shell shock on his first mission without even firing a shot. And then he wants to run from the FO because?...Reasons? I guess this is where the new books have to be taken into account. That is what the fans of this drek seem to tell you when something doesn't get explained. You basically need a manual to watch a movie now with these new ones. I know he didn't want to kill for the FO anymore. Not that he ever did in the first place. Because Jakku was his first mission. But he will kill for anyone else without thinking twice. <br><br><br>Then we have Maz. She was the one in all her infinite wisdom to yell out "HAN SOLO!" in a crowded bar knowing he has a a price on his head and also brings BB-8 with him knowing the FO is looking for it. But back to Maz. When they are sitting at the table talking she tells all of them that they must fight the FO! Then the FO brings the fight to her doorstep. And where is big game talking Maz? Oh yeah she is hiding away somewhere. <br><br><br>But this has been long enough already. I am pretty bored just thinking about TFA. Garbage movie for garbage lovers! Oh and these new Disney movies are made for the "Veruca Salt" generation. The "I want it now" ones.<br><br>"Real sets! Practical and tangible sets"...Blah blah blah! It is hillariious how some morons bought into this. TFA was a CGI fest covered turd and the idiots bought it. Disney and co. lied to your faces! They basically bent you over and had their way with you and since you are drones you took it all and asked for seconds. SMFH... So how did all that "going back to the old school" BS work out for ya?

 Capturing the old Star Wars vibe cantina and all this movie continues the saga with an amazing start. Rey played by Daisy Ridley steals the show in this film followed in a close second by Harrison Ford's Han Solo the same as ever. Adam Driver and John Boyega also deliver some good performances as side characters in the movie but they play their roles very well. Oscaar Isaac has a very small role in this and while it is small he is very noteworthy in those moments. I highly recommend this movie to any Star Wars fan and casual movie goer., 4.0,  Josh K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/931853787/, March 16 2018, N/A

 Where do I begin? For one I don't like any Star Wars at all. Unfortunately my wife is a huge fan so I have seen all of them. But the one movie that stood out from all was this The Force Awakens. It starts out with a brand-new droid who is supposed to be cute but is really just two spheres stacked up on each other. Kylo-Ren isn't a good villian. That is one god-ugly mask he has and. Kylo-Ren's ugly pale face is supposed to look evil. He looks like a nerd before a math test. And then as we learn in The Last Jedi he survived! Rey practically chopped off every body part he had. Now lets start with Rey. I mean I get the girl power stuff and everything. I get that a strong female character is what you should promote in a male-dominate country like the U.S.A (cough cough no female president. we elect cheese puffs instead.) But seriously? Flying the Millenium Falcon with no training? Beating a experienced fighter like Kylo-Ren on your first try lightsabering? I'm sorry but thats taking it a wee bit to far. Then there is Han Solo. I know that was supposed to make you cry because you know he commited patricide and its frickin' Han Solo. I was mad. Han Solo is the greatest Star Wars character of all time (behind Darth Vader of course!) and you just plain kill him off like THAT! He did NOTHING heroic he didn't even hold a lightsaber until Kylo-Ren stuck it through his chest. Then there's Finn. I understand Star Wars need to have a black guy in their movies because most characters are middle-aged white guys like our favorite character Kylo-Ren! But honestly Finn just dosen't have that many action moments and isn't that great a character. Then there is Po. Po has a huge ego as is confirmed in The Last Jedi. My impression of him is this: "Hi I'm Po. I'm better than all of you. I should be commander because I'm a white middle-aged guy.". As a bonus he has BB-8 on his ship beeping in a vaugely happy or scared way! And as unrealistic as ever the laser beams magically hit all the ships but Po's! Po swoops in for and unrealistic blowing up of Starkiller Base. Oh I'm sorry you said you needed a BIGGER Death Star. Come on J.J. Abrams. Star Wars is worth like a billion dollars. You can afford to buy a better idea then a bigger Death Star. And then they're trying to find that missing puzzle piece to find none other than... LUKE SKYWALKER!!! They find him Rey gives him the lightsaber and the movie ends. They magically blow up Starkiller Base and coincidentally they also find the last puzzle piece!<br>Now if you don't agree with me screw you. I hated this movie and I urge you to join me to hate The Force Awakens. People who hate the Last Jedi I'm with you 100%. I hate the Last Jedi. I wrote a rant for that too. But I am so sorry The Force Awakens is THE WORST movie of all time., 0.5,  Hamilton R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977165094/, March 14 2018, N/A

 The Force Awakens is a welcome return to the lived-in universe of the well-loved original trilogy. The characters are engaging the visuals are stunning and the story adeptly balances the old and the new. However the film suffers from a rehashed plot that lifts elements from A New Hope and essentially recrafts them sometimes to a fault. Though derivative TFA's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. The film manages even in the face of unprecedented hype to recapture the boundless energy that embodied the originals and was so lacking in the prequels. The Force has awakened and it's here to stay., 3.5,  Scott M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/972643831/, March 13 2018, N/A
 It has been a few years since this abomination came out. But I recently wrote a review for TLJ and I am probably going to write a review for the other SW films. But this one in particular is a horrid excuse for a film. <br><br>I will explain. First this nothing but a rehash of episode 4. But more creatively bankrupt and disgusting. And it irritates me to no end when I see/n the "apologists" for this crap over the years. The excuses that pour out of these morons are putrid! Like<br><br>"they needed to rehash it because they wanted to bring fans back that didn't like the prequels!"<br>"It needed to be done to show that SW can be exciting!" <br>"they needed to reboot it for the newer generations benefit!" <br><br><br>Even Jar Jar Abrams has admitted to rehashing it. So he basically said the he had to "play it safe" to get fans back. Uh...NO! When I see morons say how they had to "play it safe" they are just admitting that they love laziness and used ideas. Well you got another OT now you whiny rejects. Are you happy with the same crap over and over? Never mind you are! And when or if episode 10 rolls around I am very positive that they will have another trilogy of rebels vs the mighty empire. Because it is obvious that all these morons want is more of the same. <br><br>I could go on but my point is that the "apologists" bend over backwards to excuse laziness. The only obligation they had to do was to make a sequel to ROTJ. But the idiots that enjoy this drivel like being patronized by a corporate entity. They basically tried to "buy" fans back by giving them reheated left overs and calling it "new." These people who bought into it are pathetic! <br><br>Disney and LFL basically were selling the new generation used experiences. Like "hey kids? Do you want to feel the way your parents felt when the first seen SW?" This is basically robbing the newer generation of their OWN authentic experiences. That is pretty low. But since Disney and LFL apparently have no balls they just gave the world the OT 2.0. And the idiots just fell in love with the same old stuff. Some for the first time and some for the second time. With how TLJ came out they don't really do original all too well. <br><br><br>But the biggest issue for me was how they treated the force in this. MaRey Sue uses the force with 0 training. That is right. 0 training! I did pay attention to the film though. As many who claim to "love" it have not. Because it took me all but one line of dialogue to figure this out. <br><br>Kylo Ren to Snoke: She is UNTRAINED! But stronger then she knows! <br><br>See? One line of dialogue. Did that stop all the "Reytards" from wasting 2 years thinking up every excuse to try to explain how she did what she did? Nope. I had to argue for those 2 years telling these cretins that she was untrained . If they actually paid attention they wouldn't have made themselves look like tools making excuses when it was spelled out for them in the film. <br><br><br>And nice what they did to Han eh? He went back to being a smuggler. But he also became a dead beat dad too! Then killed by his own son. After knowing his son had "too much Vader" in him Han tries to talk him into coming home like he was a 10 year old that was mad because he didn't want to leave the arcade. But Han knew he wasn't coming home and I guess he got what he knew he would get. <br><br><br>And then General Leia. She was a general in the OT and also in the ST. Now that is character development right there.../S<br><br><br>Finn is the worst character in the SW universe. Well he is tied with Rose now. But in TFA he basically gets shell shock on his first mission without even firing a shot. And then he wants to run from the FO because?...Reasons? I guess this is where the new books have to be taken into account. That is what the fans of this drek seem to tell you when something doesn't get explained. You basically need a manual to watch a movie now with these new ones. I know he didn't want to kill for the FO anymore. Not that he ever did in the first place. Because Jakku was his first mission. But he will kill for anyone else without thinking twice. <br><br><br>Then we have Maz. She was the one in all her infinite wisdom to yell out "HAN SOLO!" in a crowded bar knowing he has a a price on his head and also brings BB-8 with him knowing the FO is looking for it. But back to Maz. When they are sitting at the table talking she tells all of them that they must fight the FO! Then the FO brings the fight to her doorstep. And where is big game talking Maz? Oh yeah she is hiding away somewhere. <br><br><br>But this has been long enough already. I am pretty bored just thinking about TFA. Garbage movie for garbage lovers! Oh and these new Disney movies are made for the "Veruca Salt" generation. The "I want it now" ones.<br><br>"Real sets! Practical and tangible sets"...Blah blah blah! It is hillariious how some morons bought into this. TFA was a CGI fest covered turd and the idiots bought it. Disney and co. lied to your faces! They basically bent you over and had their way with you and since you are drones you took it all and asked for seconds. SMFH... So how did all that "going back to the old school" BS work out for ya?

 Don't have a clue how it has been rated so high. The movie seemed very slapped together with terrible actor choices for characters. Nothing against Adam Driver but when he removed his mask as Kylo Renn I literally could not stop laughing dude looks much more like a Geek Squad member than a sith lord. Also an example of the plot being slapped together is how Rey somehow is a badass overnight when in the past we see Luke Skywalker and even the badass Darth Vader spent years mastering their skills and abilities. If you must watch it do so while doing homework or chores around the house so you don't completely waste your time., 1.0,  Ryan W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977170959/, March 17 2018, N/A

 Capturing the old Star Wars vibe cantina and all this movie continues the saga with an amazing start. Rey played by Daisy Ridley steals the show in this film followed in a close second by Harrison Ford's Han Solo the same as ever. Adam Driver and John Boyega also deliver some good performances as side characters in the movie but they play their roles very well. Oscaar Isaac has a very small role in this and while it is small he is very noteworthy in those moments. I highly recommend this movie to any Star Wars fan and casual movie goer., 4.0,  Josh K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/931853787/, March 16 2018, N/A

 Where do I begin? For one I don't like any Star Wars at all. Unfortunately my wife is a huge fan so I have seen all of them. But the one movie that stood out from all was this The Force Awakens. It starts out with a brand-new droid who is supposed to be cute but is really just two spheres stacked up on each other. Kylo-Ren isn't a good villian. That is one god-ugly mask he has and. Kylo-Ren's ugly pale face is supposed to look evil. He looks like a nerd before a math test. And then as we learn in The Last Jedi he survived! Rey practically chopped off every body part he had. Now lets start with Rey. I mean I get the girl power stuff and everything. I get that a strong female character is what you should promote in a male-dominate country like the U.S.A (cough cough no female president. we elect cheese puffs instead.) But seriously? Flying the Millenium Falcon with no training? Beating a experienced fighter like Kylo-Ren on your first try lightsabering? I'm sorry but thats taking it a wee bit to far. Then there is Han Solo. I know that was supposed to make you cry because you know he commited patricide and its frickin' Han Solo. I was mad. Han Solo is the greatest Star Wars character of all time (behind Darth Vader of course!) and you just plain kill him off like THAT! He did NOTHING heroic he didn't even hold a lightsaber until Kylo-Ren stuck it through his chest. Then there's Finn. I understand Star Wars need to have a black guy in their movies because most characters are middle-aged white guys like our favorite character Kylo-Ren! But honestly Finn just dosen't have that many action moments and isn't that great a character. Then there is Po. Po has a huge ego as is confirmed in The Last Jedi. My impression of him is this: "Hi I'm Po. I'm better than all of you. I should be commander because I'm a white middle-aged guy.". As a bonus he has BB-8 on his ship beeping in a vaugely happy or scared way! And as unrealistic as ever the laser beams magically hit all the ships but Po's! Po swoops in for and unrealistic blowing up of Starkiller Base. Oh I'm sorry you said you needed a BIGGER Death Star. Come on J.J. Abrams. Star Wars is worth like a billion dollars. You can afford to buy a better idea then a bigger Death Star. And then they're trying to find that missing puzzle piece to find none other than... LUKE SKYWALKER!!! They find him Rey gives him the lightsaber and the movie ends. They magically blow up Starkiller Base and coincidentally they also find the last puzzle piece!<br>Now if you don't agree with me screw you. I hated this movie and I urge you to join me to hate The Force Awakens. People who hate the Last Jedi I'm with you 100%. I hate the Last Jedi. I wrote a rant for that too. But I am so sorry The Force Awakens is THE WORST movie of all time., 0.5,  Hamilton R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977165094/, March 14 2018, N/A

 The Force Awakens is a welcome return to the lived-in universe of the well-loved original trilogy. The characters are engaging the visuals are stunning and the story adeptly balances the old and the new. However the film suffers from a rehashed plot that lifts elements from A New Hope and essentially recrafts them sometimes to a fault. Though derivative TFA's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. The film manages even in the face of unprecedented hype to recapture the boundless energy that embodied the originals and was so lacking in the prequels. The Force has awakened and it's here to stay., 3.5,  Scott M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/972643831/, March 13 2018, N/A
 It has been a few years since this abomination came out. But I recently wrote a review for TLJ and I am probably going to write a review for the other SW films. But this one in particular is a horrid excuse for a film. <br><br>I will explain. First this nothing but a rehash of episode 4. But more creatively bankrupt and disgusting. And it irritates me to no end when I see/n the "apologists" for this crap over the years. The excuses that pour out of these morons are putrid! Like<br><br>"they needed to rehash it because they wanted to bring fans back that didn't like the prequels!"<br>"It needed to be done to show that SW can be exciting!" <br>"they needed to reboot it for the newer generations benefit!" <br><br><br>Even Jar Jar Abrams has admitted to rehashing it. So he basically said the he had to "play it safe" to get fans back. Uh...NO! When I see morons say how they had to "play it safe" they are just admitting that they love laziness and used ideas. Well you got another OT now you whiny rejects. Are you happy with the same crap over and over? Never mind you are! And when or if episode 10 rolls around I am very positive that they will have another trilogy of rebels vs the mighty empire. Because it is obvious that all these morons want is more of the same. <br><br>I could go on but my point is that the "apologists" bend over backwards to excuse laziness. The only obligation they had to do was to make a sequel to ROTJ. But the idiots that enjoy this drivel like being patronized by a corporate entity. They basically tried to "buy" fans back by giving them reheated left overs and calling it "new." These people who bought into it are pathetic! <br><br>Disney and LFL basically were selling the new generation used experiences. Like "hey kids? Do you want to feel the way your parents felt when the first seen SW?" This is basically robbing the newer generation of their OWN authentic experiences. That is pretty low. But since Disney and LFL apparently have no balls they just gave the world the OT 2.0. And the idiots just fell in love with the same old stuff. Some for the first time and some for the second time. With how TLJ came out they don't really do original all too well. <br><br><br>But the biggest issue for me was how they treated the force in this. MaRey Sue uses the force with 0 training. That is right. 0 training! I did pay attention to the film though. As many who claim to "love" it have not. Because it took me all but one line of dialogue to figure this out. <br><br>Kylo Ren to Snoke: She is UNTRAINED! But stronger then she knows! <br><br>See? One line of dialogue. Did that stop all the "Reytards" from wasting 2 years thinking up every excuse to try to explain how she did what she did? Nope. I had to argue for those 2 years telling these cretins that she was untrained . If they actually paid attention they wouldn't have made themselves look like tools making excuses when it was spelled out for them in the film. <br><br><br>And nice what they did to Han eh? He went back to being a smuggler. But he also became a dead beat dad too! Then killed by his own son. After knowing his son had "too much Vader" in him Han tries to talk him into coming home like he was a 10 year old that was mad because he didn't want to leave the arcade. But Han knew he wasn't coming home and I guess he got what he knew he would get. <br><br><br>And then General Leia. She was a general in the OT and also in the ST. Now that is character development right there.../S<br><br><br>Finn is the worst character in the SW universe. Well he is tied with Rose now. But in TFA he basically gets shell shock on his first mission without even firing a shot. And then he wants to run from the FO because?...Reasons? I guess this is where the new books have to be taken into account. That is what the fans of this drek seem to tell you when something doesn't get explained. You basically need a manual to watch a movie now with these new ones. I know he didn't want to kill for the FO anymore. Not that he ever did in the first place. Because Jakku was his first mission. But he will kill for anyone else without thinking twice. <br><br><br>Then we have Maz. She was the one in all her infinite wisdom to yell out "HAN SOLO!" in a crowded bar knowing he has a a price on his head and also brings BB-8 with him knowing the FO is looking for it. But back to Maz. When they are sitting at the table talking she tells all of them that they must fight the FO! Then the FO brings the fight to her doorstep. And where is big game talking Maz? Oh yeah she is hiding away somewhere. <br><br><br>But this has been long enough already. I am pretty bored just thinking about TFA. Garbage movie for garbage lovers! Oh and these new Disney movies are made for the "Veruca Salt" generation. The "I want it now" ones.<br><br>"Real sets! Practical and tangible sets"...Blah blah blah! It is hillariious how some morons bought into this. TFA was a CGI fest covered turd and the idiots bought it. Disney and co. lied to your faces! They basically bent you over and had their way with you and since you are drones you took it all and asked for seconds. SMFH... So how did all that "going back to the old school" BS work out for ya? I bet you are feeling mighty stupid right about now? Disney will keep on lying and the morons will keep buyin'!, 1.0,  Gabber C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977088517/, March 13 2018, N/A

 Don't have a clue how it has been rated so high. The movie seemed very slapped together with terrible actor choices for characters. Nothing against Adam Driver but when he removed his mask as Kylo Renn I literally could not stop laughing dude looks much more like a Geek Squad member than a sith lord. Also an example of the plot being slapped together is how Rey somehow is a badass overnight when in the past we see Luke Skywalker and even the badass Darth Vader spent years mastering their skills and abilities.

 Capturing the old Star Wars vibe cantina and all this movie continues the saga with an amazing start. Rey played by Daisy Ridley steals the show in this film followed in a close second by Harrison Ford's Han Solo the same as ever. Adam Driver and John Boyega also deliver some good performances as side characters in the movie but they play their roles very well. Oscaar Isaac has a very small role in this and while it is small he is very noteworthy in those moments. I highly recommend this movie to any Star Wars fan and casual movie goer., 4.0,  Josh K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/931853787/, March 16 2018, N/A

 Where do I begin? For one I don't like any Star Wars at all. Unfortunately my wife is a huge fan so I have seen all of them. But the one movie that stood out from all was this The Force Awakens. It starts out with a brand-new droid who is supposed to be cute but is really just two spheres stacked up on each other. Kylo-Ren isn't a good villian. That is one god-ugly mask he has and. Kylo-Ren's ugly pale face is supposed to look evil. He looks like a nerd before a math test. And then as we learn in The Last Jedi he survived! Rey practically chopped off every body part he had. Now lets start with Rey. I mean I get the girl power stuff and everything. I get that a strong female character is what you should promote in a male-dominate country like the U.S.A (cough cough no female president. we elect cheese puffs instead.) But seriously? Flying the Millenium Falcon with no training? Beating a experienced fighter like Kylo-Ren on your first try lightsabering? I'm sorry but thats taking it a wee bit to far. Then there is Han Solo. I know that was supposed to make you cry because you know he commited patricide and its frickin' Han Solo. I was mad. Han Solo is the greatest Star Wars character of all time (behind Darth Vader of course!) and you just plain kill him off like THAT! He did NOTHING heroic he didn't even hold a lightsaber until Kylo-Ren stuck it through his chest. Then there's Finn. I understand Star Wars need to have a black guy in their movies because most characters are middle-aged white guys like our favorite character Kylo-Ren! But honestly Finn just dosen't have that many action moments and isn't that great a character. Then there is Po. Po has a huge ego as is confirmed in The Last Jedi. My impression of him is this: "Hi I'm Po. I'm better than all of you. I should be commander because I'm a white middle-aged guy.". As a bonus he has BB-8 on his ship beeping in a vaugely happy or scared way! And as unrealistic as ever the laser beams magically hit all the ships but Po's! Po swoops in for and unrealistic blowing up of Starkiller Base. Oh I'm sorry you said you needed a BIGGER Death Star. Come on J.J. Abrams. Star Wars is worth like a billion dollars. You can afford to buy a better idea then a bigger Death Star. And then they're trying to find that missing puzzle piece to find none other than... LUKE SKYWALKER!!! They find him Rey gives him the lightsaber and the movie ends. They magically blow up Starkiller Base and coincidentally they also find the last puzzle piece!<br>Now if you don't agree with me screw you. I hated this movie and I urge you to join me to hate The Force Awakens. People who hate the Last Jedi I'm with you 100%. I hate the Last Jedi. I wrote a rant for that too. But I am so sorry The Force Awakens is THE WORST movie of all time., 0.5,  Hamilton R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977165094/, March 14 2018, N/A

 The Force Awakens is a welcome return to the lived-in universe of the well-loved original trilogy. The characters are engaging the visuals are stunning and the story adeptly balances the old and the new. However the film suffers from a rehashed plot that lifts elements from A New Hope and essentially recrafts them sometimes to a fault. Though derivative TFA's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. The film manages even in the face of unprecedented hype to recapture the boundless energy that embodied the originals and was so lacking in the prequels. The Force has awakened and it's here to stay., 3.5,  Scott M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/972643831/, March 13 2018, N/A
 It has been a few years since this abomination came out. But I recently wrote a review for TLJ and I am probably going to write a review for the other SW films. But this one in particular is a horrid excuse for a film. <br><br>I will explain. First this nothing but a rehash of episode 4. But more creatively bankrupt and disgusting. And it irritates me to no end when I see/n the "apologists" for this crap over the years. The excuses that pour out of these morons are putrid! Like<br><br>"they needed to rehash it because they wanted to bring fans back that didn't like the prequels!"<br>"It needed to be done to show that SW can be exciting!" <br>"they needed to reboot it for the newer generations benefit!" <br><br><br>Even Jar Jar Abrams has admitted to rehashing it. So he basically said the he had to "play it safe" to get fans back. Uh...NO! When I see morons say how they had to "play it safe" they are just admitting that they love laziness and used ideas. Well you got another OT now you whiny rejects. Are you happy with the same crap over and over? Never mind you are! And when or if episode 10 rolls around I am very positive that they will have another trilogy of rebels vs the mighty empire. Because it is obvious that all these morons want is more of the same. <br><br>I could go on but my point is that the "apologists" bend over backwards to excuse laziness. The only obligation they had to do was to make a sequel to ROTJ. But the idiots that enjoy this drivel like being patronized by a corporate entity. They basically tried to "buy" fans back by giving them reheated left overs and calling it "new." These people who bought into it are pathetic! <br><br>Disney and LFL basically were selling the new generation used experiences. Like "hey kids? Do you want to feel the way your parents felt when the first seen SW?" This is basically robbing the newer generation of their OWN authentic experiences. That is pretty low. But since Disney and LFL apparently have no balls they just gave the world the OT 2.0. And the idiots just fell in love with the same old stuff. Some for the first time and some for the second time. With how TLJ came out they don't really do original all too well. <br><br><br>But the biggest issue for me was how they treated the force in this. MaRey Sue uses the force with 0 training. That is right. 0 training! I did pay attention to the film though. As many who claim to "love" it have not. Because it took me all but one line of dialogue to figure this out. <br><br>Kylo Ren to Snoke: She is UNTRAINED! But stronger then she knows! <br><br>See? One line of dialogue. Did that stop all the "Reytards" from wasting 2 years thinking up every excuse to try to explain how she did what she did? Nope. I had to argue for those 2 years telling these cretins that she was untrained . If they actually paid attention they wouldn't have made themselves look like tools making excuses when it was spelled out for them in the film. <br><br><br>And nice what they did to Han eh? He went back to being a smuggler. But he also became a dead beat dad too! Then killed by his own son. After knowing his son had "too much Vader" in him Han tries to talk him into coming home like he was a 10 year old that was mad because he didn't want to leave the arcade. But Han knew he wasn't coming home and I guess he got what he knew he would get. <br><br><br>And then General Leia. She was a general in the OT and also in the ST. Now that is character development right there.../S<br><br><br>Finn is the worst character in the SW universe. Well he is tied with Rose now. But in TFA he basically gets shell shock on his first mission without even firing a shot. And then he wants to run from the FO because?...Reasons? I guess this is where the new books have to be taken into account. That is what the fans of this drek seem to tell you when something doesn't get explained. You basically need a manual to watch a movie now with these new ones. I know he didn't want to kill for the FO anymore. Not that he ever did in the first place. Because Jakku was his first mission. But he will kill for anyone else without thinking twice. <br><br><br>Then we have Maz. She was the one in all her infinite wisdom to yell out "HAN SOLO!" in a crowded bar knowing he has a a price on his head and also brings BB-8 with him knowing the FO is looking for it. But back to Maz. When they are sitting at the table talking she tells all of them that they must fight the FO! Then the FO brings the fight to her doorstep. And where is big game talking Maz? Oh yeah she is hiding away somewhere. <br><br><br>But this has been long enough already. I am pretty bored just thinking about TFA. Garbage movie for garbage lovers! Oh and these new Disney movies are made for the "Veruca Salt" generation. The "I want it now" ones.<br><br>"Real sets! Practical and tangible sets"...Blah blah blah! It is hillariious how some morons bought into this. TFA was a CGI fest covered turd and the idiots bought it. Disney and co. lied to your faces! They basically bent you over and had their way with you and since you are drones you took it all and asked for seconds. SMFH... So how did all that "going back to the old school" BS work out for ya?

 Reviewed 12.14.17. Another Death Star? Really another darn Death Star? The lack of originality in the script would be enough alone to sink most movies. Yet it survives and dare I say even thrives. Why? A combination of deep nostalgia and excellent pacing. For every moment where I cringed (hokey usage of previous Star War's lines implausible relocation of characters from frame to frame and oh did I mention a THIRD DEATH STAR?!) there was something funny or amusing. For a viewer new to the series it might not resonate.

 Don't have a clue how it has been rated so high. The movie seemed very slapped together with terrible actor choices for characters. Nothing against Adam Driver but when he removed his mask as Kylo Renn I literally could not stop laughing dude looks much more like a Geek Squad member than a sith lord. Also an example of the plot being slapped together is how Rey somehow is a badass overnight when in the past we see Luke Skywalker and even the badass Darth Vader spent years mastering their skills and abilities.

 Capturing the old Star Wars vibe cantina and all this movie continues the saga with an amazing start. Rey played by Daisy Ridley steals the show in this film followed in a close second by Harrison Ford's Han Solo the same as ever. Adam Driver and John Boyega also deliver some good performances as side characters in the movie but they play their roles very well. Oscaar Isaac has a very small role in this and while it is small he is very noteworthy in those moments.

 Where do I begin? For one I don't like any Star Wars at all. Unfortunately my wife is a huge fan so I have seen all of them. But the one movie that stood out from all was this The Force Awakens. It starts out with a brand-new droid who is supposed to be cute but is really just two spheres stacked up on each other. Kylo-Ren isn't a good villian. That is one god-ugly mask he has and. Kylo-Ren's ugly pale face is supposed to look evil. He looks like a nerd before a math test. And then as we learn in The Last Jedi he survived! Rey practically chopped off every body part he had. Now lets start with Rey. I mean I get the girl power stuff and everything. I get that a strong female character is what you should promote in a male-dominate country like the U.S.A (cough cough no female president. we elect cheese puffs instead.) But seriously? Flying the Millenium Falcon with no training? Beating a experienced fighter like Kylo-Ren on your first try lightsabering? I'm sorry but thats taking it a wee bit to far. Then there is Han Solo. I know that was supposed to make you cry because you know he commited patricide and its frickin' Han Solo. I was mad. Han Solo is the greatest Star Wars character of all time (behind Darth Vader of course!) and you just plain kill him off like THAT! He did NOTHING heroic he didn't even hold a lightsaber until Kylo-Ren stuck it through his chest. Then there's Finn. I understand Star Wars need to have a black guy in their movies because most characters are middle-aged white guys like our favorite character Kylo-Ren! But honestly Finn just dosen't have that many action moments and isn't that great a character. Then there is Po. Po has a huge ego as is confirmed in The Last Jedi. My impression of him is this: "Hi I'm Po. I'm better than all of you. I should be commander because I'm a white middle-aged guy.". As a bonus he has BB-8 on his ship beeping in a vaugely happy or scared way! And as unrealistic as ever the laser beams magically hit all the ships but Po's! Po swoops in for and unrealistic blowing up of Starkiller Base. Oh I'm sorry you said you needed a BIGGER Death Star. Come on J.J. Abrams. Star Wars is worth like a billion dollars. You can afford to buy a better idea then a bigger Death Star. And then they're trying to find that missing puzzle piece to find none other than... LUKE SKYWALKER!!! They find him Rey gives him the lightsaber and the movie ends. They magically blow up Starkiller Base and coincidentally they also find the last puzzle piece!<br>Now if you don't agree with me screw you. I hated this movie and I urge you to join me to hate The Force Awakens. People who hate the Last Jedi I'm with you 100%. I hate the Last Jedi. I wrote a rant for that too. But I am so sorry The Force Awakens is THE WORST movie of all time., 0.5,  Hamilton R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977165094/, March 14 2018, N/A

 The Force Awakens is a welcome return to the lived-in universe of the well-loved original trilogy. The characters are engaging the visuals are stunning and the story adeptly balances the old and the new. However the film suffers from a rehashed plot that lifts elements from A New Hope and essentially recrafts them sometimes to a fault. Though derivative TFA's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. The film manages even in the face of unprecedented hype to recapture the boundless energy that embodied the originals and was so lacking in the prequels. The Force has awakened and it's here to stay., 3.5,  Scott M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/972643831/, March 13 2018, N/A
 It has been a few years since this abomination came out. But I recently wrote a review for TLJ and I am probably going to write a review for the other SW films. But this one in particular is a horrid excuse for a film. <br><br>I will explain. First this nothing but a rehash of episode 4. But more creatively bankrupt and disgusting. And it irritates me to no end when I see/n the "apologists" for this crap over the years. The excuses that pour out of these morons are putrid! Like<br><br>"they needed to rehash it because they wanted to bring fans back that didn't like the prequels!"<br>"It needed to be done to show that SW can be exciting!" <br>"they needed to reboot it for the newer generations benefit!" <br><br><br>Even Jar Jar Abrams has admitted to rehashing it. So he basically said the he had to "play it safe" to get fans back. Uh...NO! When I see morons say how they had to "play it safe" they are just admitting that they love laziness and used ideas. Well you got another OT now you whiny rejects. Are you happy with the same crap over and over? Never mind you are! And when or if episode 10 rolls around I am very positive that they will have another trilogy of rebels vs the mighty empire. Because it is obvious that all these morons want is more of the same. <br><br>I could go on but my point is that the "apologists" bend over backwards to excuse laziness. The only obligation they had to do was to make a sequel to ROTJ. But the idiots that enjoy this drivel like being patronized by a corporate entity. They basically tried to "buy" fans back by giving them reheated left overs and calling it "new." These people who bought into it are pathetic! <br><br>Disney and LFL basically were selling the new generation used experiences. Like "hey kids? Do you want to feel the way your parents felt when the first seen SW?" This is basically robbing the newer generation of their OWN authentic experiences. That is pretty low. But since Disney and LFL apparently have no balls they just gave the world the OT 2.0. And the idiots just fell in love with the same old stuff. Some for the first time and some for the second time. With how TLJ came out they don't really do original all too well. <br><br><br>But the biggest issue for me was how they treated the force in this. MaRey Sue uses the force with 0 training. That is right. 0 training! I did pay attention to the film though. As many who claim to "love" it have not. Because it took me all but one line of dialogue to figure this out. <br><br>Kylo Ren to Snoke: She is UNTRAINED! But stronger then she knows! <br><br>See? One line of dialogue. Did that stop all the "Reytards" from wasting 2 years thinking up every excuse to try to explain how she did what she did? Nope. I had to argue for those 2 years telling these cretins that she was untrained . If they actually paid attention they wouldn't have made themselves look like tools making excuses when it was spelled out for them in the film. <br><br><br>And nice what they did to Han eh? He went back to being a smuggler. But he also became a dead beat dad too! Then killed by his own son. After knowing his son had "too much Vader" in him Han tries to talk him into coming home like he was a 10 year old that was mad because he didn't want to leave the arcade. But Han knew he wasn't coming home and I guess he got what he knew he would get. <br><br><br>And then General Leia. She was a general in the OT and also in the ST. Now that is character development right there.../S<br><br><br>Finn is the worst character in the SW universe. Well he is tied with Rose now. But in TFA he basically gets shell shock on his first mission without even firing a shot. And then he wants to run from the FO because?...Reasons? I guess this is where the new books have to be taken into account. That is what the fans of this drek seem to tell you when something doesn't get explained. You basically need a manual to watch a movie now with these new ones. I know he didn't want to kill for the FO anymore. Not that he ever did in the first place. Because Jakku was his first mission. But he will kill for anyone else without thinking twice. <br><br><br>Then we have Maz. She was the one in all her infinite wisdom to yell out "HAN SOLO!" in a crowded bar knowing he has a a price on his head and also brings BB-8 with him knowing the FO is looking for it. But back to Maz. When they are sitting at the table talking she tells all of them that they must fight the FO! Then the FO brings the fight to her doorstep. And where is big game talking Maz? Oh yeah she is hiding away somewhere. <br><br><br>But this has been long enough already. I am pretty bored just thinking about TFA. Garbage movie for garbage lovers! Oh and these new Disney movies are made for the "Veruca Salt" generation. The "I want it now" ones.<br><br>"Real sets! Practical and tangible sets"...Blah blah blah! It is hillariious how some morons bought into this. TFA was a CGI fest covered turd and the idiots bought it. Disney and co. lied to your faces! They basically bent you over and had their way with you and since you are drones you took it all and asked for seconds. SMFH... So how did all that "going back to the old school" BS work out for ya?

 This film is great in all of the following things: Acting visuals score costume design and screenplay. But all of that is ruined by J.J. Abrams lack of storytelling.

 Don't have a clue how it has been rated so high. The movie seemed very slapped together with terrible actor choices for characters. Nothing against Adam Driver but when he removed his mask as Kylo Renn I literally could not stop laughing dude looks much more like a Geek Squad member than a sith lord. Also an example of the plot being slapped together is how Rey somehow is a badass overnight when in the past we see Luke Skywalker and even the badass Darth Vader spent years mastering their skills and abilities.

 Capturing the old Star Wars vibe cantina and all this movie continues the saga with an amazing start. Rey played by Daisy Ridley steals the show in this film followed in a close second by Harrison Ford's Han Solo the same as ever. Adam Driver and John Boyega also deliver some good performances as side characters in the movie but they play their roles very well. Oscaar Isaac has a very small role in this and while it is small he is very noteworthy in those moments.

 Where do I begin? For one I don't like any Star Wars at all. Unfortunately my wife is a huge fan so I have seen all of them. But the one movie that stood out from all was this The Force Awakens. It starts out with a brand-new droid who is supposed to be cute but is really just two spheres stacked up on each other. Kylo-Ren isn't a good villian. That is one god-ugly mask he has and. Kylo-Ren's ugly pale face is supposed to look evil. He looks like a nerd before a math test. And then as we learn in The Last Jedi he survived! Rey practically chopped off every body part he had. Now lets start with Rey. I mean I get the girl power stuff and everything. I get that a strong female character is what you should promote in a male-dominate country like the U.S.A (cough cough no female president. we elect cheese puffs instead.) But seriously? Flying the Millenium Falcon with no training? Beating a experienced fighter like Kylo-Ren on your first try lightsabering? I'm sorry but thats taking it a wee bit to far. Then there is Han Solo. I know that was supposed to make you cry because you know he commited patricide and its frickin' Han Solo. I was mad. Han Solo is the greatest Star Wars character of all time (behind Darth Vader of course!) and you just plain kill him off like THAT! He did NOTHING heroic he didn't even hold a lightsaber until Kylo-Ren stuck it through his chest. Then there's Finn. I understand Star Wars need to have a black guy in their movies because most characters are middle-aged white guys like our favorite character Kylo-Ren! But honestly Finn just dosen't have that many action moments and isn't that great a character. Then there is Po. Po has a huge ego as is confirmed in The Last Jedi. My impression of him is this: "Hi I'm Po. I'm better than all of you. I should be commander because I'm a white middle-aged guy.". As a bonus he has BB-8 on his ship beeping in a vaugely happy or scared way! And as unrealistic as ever the laser beams magically hit all the ships but Po's! Po swoops in for and unrealistic blowing up of Starkiller Base. Oh I'm sorry you said you needed a BIGGER Death Star. Come on J.J. Abrams. Star Wars is worth like a billion dollars. You can afford to buy a better idea then a bigger Death Star. And then they're trying to find that missing puzzle piece to find none other than... LUKE SKYWALKER!!! They find him Rey gives him the lightsaber and the movie ends. They magically blow up Starkiller Base and coincidentally they also find the last puzzle piece!<br>Now if you don't agree with me screw you. I hated this movie and I urge you to join me to hate The Force Awakens. People who hate the Last Jedi I'm with you 100%. I hate the Last Jedi. I wrote a rant for that too. But I am so sorry The Force Awakens is THE WORST movie of all time., 0.5,  Hamilton R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977165094/, March 14 2018, N/A

 The Force Awakens is a welcome return to the lived-in universe of the well-loved original trilogy. The characters are engaging the visuals are stunning and the story adeptly balances the old and the new. However the film suffers from a rehashed plot that lifts elements from A New Hope and essentially recrafts them sometimes to a fault. Though derivative TFA's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. The film manages even in the face of unprecedented hype to recapture the boundless energy that embodied the originals and was so lacking in the prequels. The Force has awakened and it's here to stay., 3.5,  Scott M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/972643831/, March 13 2018, N/A
 It has been a few years since this abomination came out. But I recently wrote a review for TLJ and I am probably going to write a review for the other SW films. But this one in particular is a horrid excuse for a film. <br><br>I will explain. First this nothing but a rehash of episode 4. But more creatively bankrupt and disgusting. And it irritates me to no end when I see/n the "apologists" for this crap over the years. The excuses that pour out of these morons are putrid! Like<br><br>"they needed to rehash it because they wanted to bring fans back that didn't like the prequels!"<br>"It needed to be done to show that SW can be exciting!" <br>"they needed to reboot it for the newer generations benefit!" <br><br><br>Even Jar Jar Abrams has admitted to rehashing it. So he basically said the he had to "play it safe" to get fans back. Uh...NO! When I see morons say how they had to "play it safe" they are just admitting that they love laziness and used ideas. Well you got another OT now you whiny rejects. Are you happy with the same crap over and over? Never mind you are! And when or if episode 10 rolls around I am very positive that they will have another trilogy of rebels vs the mighty empire. Because it is obvious that all these morons want is more of the same. <br><br>I could go on but my point is that the "apologists" bend over backwards to excuse laziness. The only obligation they had to do was to make a sequel to ROTJ. But the idiots that enjoy this drivel like being patronized by a corporate entity. They basically tried to "buy" fans back by giving them reheated left overs and calling it "new." These people who bought into it are pathetic! <br><br>Disney and LFL basically were selling the new generation used experiences. Like "hey kids? Do you want to feel the way your parents felt when the first seen SW?" This is basically robbing the newer generation of their OWN authentic experiences. That is pretty low. But since Disney and LFL apparently have no balls they just gave the world the OT 2.0. And the idiots just fell in love with the same old stuff. Some for the first time and some for the second time. With how TLJ came out they don't really do original all too well. <br><br><br>But the biggest issue for me was how they treated the force in this. MaRey Sue uses the force with 0 training. That is right. 0 training! I did pay attention to the film though. As many who claim to "love" it have not. Because it took me all but one line of dialogue to figure this out. <br><br>Kylo Ren to Snoke: She is UNTRAINED! But stronger then she knows! <br><br>See? One line of dialogue. Did that stop all the "Reytards" from wasting 2 years thinking up every excuse to try to explain how she did what she did? Nope. I had to argue for those 2 years telling these cretins that she was untrained . If they actually paid attention they wouldn't have made themselves look like tools making excuses when it was spelled out for them in the film. <br><br><br>And nice what they did to Han eh? He went back to being a smuggler. But he also became a dead beat dad too! Then killed by his own son. After knowing his son had "too much Vader" in him Han tries to talk him into coming home like he was a 10 year old that was mad because he didn't want to leave the arcade. But Han knew he wasn't coming home and I guess he got what he knew he would get. <br><br><br>And then General Leia. She was a general in the OT and also in the ST. Now that is character development right there.../S<br><br><br>Finn is the worst character in the SW universe. Well he is tied with Rose now. But in TFA he basically gets shell shock on his first mission without even firing a shot. And then he wants to run from the FO because?...Reasons? I guess this is where the new books have to be taken into account. That is what the fans of this drek seem to tell you when something doesn't get explained. You basically need a manual to watch a movie now with these new ones. I know he didn't want to kill for the FO anymore. Not that he ever did in the first place. Because Jakku was his first mission. But he will kill for anyone else without thinking twice. <br><br><br>Then we have Maz. She was the one in all her infinite wisdom to yell out "HAN SOLO!" in a crowded bar knowing he has a a price on his head and also brings BB-8 with him knowing the FO is looking for it. But back to Maz. When they are sitting at the table talking she tells all of them that they must fight the FO! Then the FO brings the fight to her doorstep. And where is big game talking Maz? Oh yeah she is hiding away somewhere. <br><br><br>But this has been long enough already. I am pretty bored just thinking about TFA. Garbage movie for garbage lovers! Oh and these new Disney movies are made for the "Veruca Salt" generation. The "I want it now" ones.<br><br>"Real sets! Practical and tangible sets"...Blah blah blah! It is hillariious how some morons bought into this. TFA was a CGI fest covered turd and the idiots bought it. Disney and co. lied to your faces! They basically bent you over and had their way with you and since you are drones you took it all and asked for seconds. SMFH... So how did all that "going back to the old school" BS work out for ya?

 This film is great in all of the following things: Acting visuals score costume design and screenplay. But all of that is ruined by J.J. Abrams lack of storytelling.

 Don't have a clue how it has been rated so high. The movie seemed very slapped together with terrible actor choices for characters. Nothing against Adam Driver but when he removed his mask as Kylo Renn I literally could not stop laughing dude looks much more like a Geek Squad member than a sith lord. Also an example of the plot being slapped together is how Rey somehow is a badass overnight when in the past we see Luke Skywalker and even the badass Darth Vader spent years mastering their skills and abilities.

 Capturing the old Star Wars vibe cantina and all this movie continues the saga with an amazing start. Rey played by Daisy Ridley steals the show in this film followed in a close second by Harrison Ford's Han Solo the same as ever. Adam Driver and John Boyega also deliver some good performances as side characters in the movie but they play their roles very well. Oscaar Isaac has a very small role in this and while it is small he is very noteworthy in those moments.

 Where do I begin? For one I don't like any Star Wars at all. Unfortunately my wife is a huge fan so I have seen all of them. But the one movie that stood out from all was this The Force Awakens. It starts out with a brand-new droid who is supposed to be cute but is really just two spheres stacked up on each other. Kylo-Ren isn't a good villian. That is one god-ugly mask he has and. Kylo-Ren's ugly pale face is supposed to look evil. He looks like a nerd before a math test. And then as we learn in The Last Jedi he survived! Rey practically chopped off every body part he had. Now lets start with Rey. I mean I get the girl power stuff and everything. I get that a strong female character is what you should promote in a male-dominate country like the U.S.A (cough cough no female president. we elect cheese puffs instead.) But seriously? Flying the Millenium Falcon with no training? Beating a experienced fighter like Kylo-Ren on your first try lightsabering? I'm sorry but thats taking it a wee bit to far. Then there is Han Solo. I know that was supposed to make you cry because you know he commited patricide and its frickin' Han Solo. I was mad. Han Solo is the greatest Star Wars character of all time (behind Darth Vader of course!) and you just plain kill him off like THAT! He did NOTHING heroic he didn't even hold a lightsaber until Kylo-Ren stuck it through his chest. Then there's Finn. I understand Star Wars need to have a black guy in their movies because most characters are middle-aged white guys like our favorite character Kylo-Ren! But honestly Finn just dosen't have that many action moments and isn't that great a character. Then there is Po. Po has a huge ego as is confirmed in The Last Jedi. My impression of him is this: "Hi I'm Po. I'm better than all of you. I should be commander because I'm a white middle-aged guy.". As a bonus he has BB-8 on his ship beeping in a vaugely happy or scared way! And as unrealistic as ever the laser beams magically hit all the ships but Po's! Po swoops in for and unrealistic blowing up of Starkiller Base. Oh I'm sorry you said you needed a BIGGER Death Star. Come on J.J. Abrams. Star Wars is worth like a billion dollars. You can afford to buy a better idea then a bigger Death Star. And then they're trying to find that missing puzzle piece to find none other than... LUKE SKYWALKER!!! They find him Rey gives him the lightsaber and the movie ends. They magically blow up Starkiller Base and coincidentally they also find the last puzzle piece!<br>Now if you don't agree with me screw you. I hated this movie and I urge you to join me to hate The Force Awakens. People who hate the Last Jedi I'm with you 100%. I hate the Last Jedi. I wrote a rant for that too. But I am so sorry The Force Awakens is THE WORST movie of all time., 0.5,  Hamilton R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977165094/, March 14 2018, N/A

 The Force Awakens is a welcome return to the lived-in universe of the well-loved original trilogy. The characters are engaging the visuals are stunning and the story adeptly balances the old and the new. However the film suffers from a rehashed plot that lifts elements from A New Hope and essentially recrafts them sometimes to a fault. Though derivative TFA's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. The film manages even in the face of unprecedented hype to recapture the boundless energy that embodied the originals and was so lacking in the prequels. The Force has awakened and it's here to stay., 3.5,  Scott M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/972643831/, March 13 2018, N/A
 It has been a few years since this abomination came out. But I recently wrote a review for TLJ and I am probably going to write a review for the other SW films. But this one in particular is a horrid excuse for a film. <br><br>I will explain. First this nothing but a rehash of episode 4. But more creatively bankrupt and disgusting. And it irritates me to no end when I see/n the "apologists" for this crap over the years. The excuses that pour out of these morons are putrid! Like<br><br>"they needed to rehash it because they wanted to bring fans back that didn't like the prequels!"<br>"It needed to be done to show that SW can be exciting!" <br>"they needed to reboot it for the newer generations benefit!" <br><br><br>Even Jar Jar Abrams has admitted to rehashing it. So he basically said the he had to "play it safe" to get fans back. Uh...NO! When I see morons say how they had to "play it safe" they are just admitting that they love laziness and used ideas. Well you got another OT now you whiny rejects. Are you happy with the same crap over and over? Never mind you are! And when or if episode 10 rolls around I am very positive that they will have another trilogy of rebels vs the mighty empire. Because it is obvious that all these morons want is more of the same. <br><br>I could go on but my point is that the "apologists" bend over backwards to excuse laziness. The only obligation they had to do was to make a sequel to ROTJ. But the idiots that enjoy this drivel like being patronized by a corporate entity. They basically tried to "buy" fans back by giving them reheated left overs and calling it "new." These people who bought into it are pathetic! <br><br>Disney and LFL basically were selling the new generation used experiences. Like "hey kids? Do you want to feel the way your parents felt when the first seen SW?" This is basically robbing the newer generation of their OWN authentic experiences. That is pretty low. But since Disney and LFL apparently have no balls they just gave the world the OT 2.0. And the idiots just fell in love with the same old stuff. Some for the first time and some for the second time. With how TLJ came out they don't really do original all too well. <br><br><br>But the biggest issue for me was how they treated the force in this. MaRey Sue uses the force with 0 training. That is right. 0 training! I did pay attention to the film though. As many who claim to "love" it have not. Because it took me all but one line of dialogue to figure this out. <br><br>Kylo Ren to Snoke: She is UNTRAINED! But stronger then she knows! <br><br>See? One line of dialogue. Did that stop all the "Reytards" from wasting 2 years thinking up every excuse to try to explain how she did what she did? Nope. I had to argue for those 2 years telling these cretins that she was untrained . If they actually paid attention they wouldn't have made themselves look like tools making excuses when it was spelled out for them in the film. <br><br><br>And nice what they did to Han eh? He went back to being a smuggler. But he also became a dead beat dad too! Then killed by his own son. After knowing his son had "too much Vader" in him Han tries to talk him into coming home like he was a 10 year old that was mad because he didn't want to leave the arcade. But Han knew he wasn't coming home and I guess he got what he knew he would get. <br><br><br>And then General Leia. She was a general in the OT and also in the ST. Now that is character development right there.../S<br><br><br>Finn is the worst character in the SW universe. Well he is tied with Rose now. But in TFA he basically gets shell shock on his first mission without even firing a shot. And then he wants to run from the FO because?...Reasons? I guess this is where the new books have to be taken into account. That is what the fans of this drek seem to tell you when something doesn't get explained. You basically need a manual to watch a movie now with these new ones. I know he didn't want to kill for the FO anymore. Not that he ever did in the first place. Because Jakku was his first mission. But he will kill for anyone else without thinking twice. <br><br><br>Then we have Maz. She was the one in all her infinite wisdom to yell out "HAN SOLO!" in a crowded bar knowing he has a a price on his head and also brings BB-8 with him knowing the FO is looking for it. But back to Maz. When they are sitting at the table talking she tells all of them that they must fight the FO! Then the FO brings the fight to her doorstep. And where is big game talking Maz? Oh yeah she is hiding away somewhere. <br><br><br>But this has been long enough already. I am pretty bored just thinking about TFA. Garbage movie for garbage lovers! Oh and these new Disney movies are made for the "Veruca Salt" generation. The "I want it now" ones.<br><br>"Real sets! Practical and tangible sets"...Blah blah blah!

 This film is great in all of the following things: Acting visuals score costume design and screenplay. But all of that is ruined by J.J. Abrams lack of storytelling.

 Capturing the old Star Wars vibe cantina and all this movie continues the saga with an amazing start. Rey played by Daisy Ridley steals the show in this film followed in a close second by Harrison Ford's Han Solo the same as ever. Adam Driver and John Boyega also deliver some good performances as side characters in the movie but they play their roles very well. Oscaar Isaac has a very small role in this and while it is small he is very noteworthy in those moments.

 Where do I begin? For one I don't like any Star Wars at all. Unfortunately my wife is a huge fan so I have seen all of them. But the one movie that stood out from all was this The Force Awakens. It starts out with a brand-new droid who is supposed to be cute but is really just two spheres stacked up on each other. Kylo-Ren isn't a good villian. That is one god-ugly mask he has and. Kylo-Ren's ugly pale face is supposed to look evil. He looks like a nerd before a math test. And then as we learn in The Last Jedi he survived! Rey practically chopped off every body part he had. Now lets start with Rey. I mean I get the girl power stuff and everything. I get that a strong female character is what you should promote in a male-dominate country like the U.S.A (cough cough no female president. we elect cheese puffs instead.) But seriously? Flying the Millenium Falcon with no training? Beating a experienced fighter like Kylo-Ren on your first try lightsabering? I'm sorry but thats taking it a wee bit to far. Then there is Han Solo. I know that was supposed to make you cry because you know he commited patricide and its frickin' Han Solo. I was mad. Han Solo is the greatest Star Wars character of all time (behind Darth Vader of course!) and you just plain kill him off like THAT! He did NOTHING heroic he didn't even hold a lightsaber until Kylo-Ren stuck it through his chest. Then there's Finn. I understand Star Wars need to have a black guy in their movies because most characters are middle-aged white guys like our favorite character Kylo-Ren! But honestly Finn just dosen't have that many action moments and isn't that great a character. Then there is Po. Po has a huge ego as is confirmed in The Last Jedi. My impression of him is this: "Hi I'm Po. I'm better than all of you. I should be commander because I'm a white middle-aged guy.". As a bonus he has BB-8 on his ship beeping in a vaugely happy or scared way! And as unrealistic as ever the laser beams magically hit all the ships but Po's! Po swoops in for and unrealistic blowing up of Starkiller Base. Oh I'm sorry you said you needed a BIGGER Death Star. Come on J.J. Abrams. Star Wars is worth like a billion dollars. You can afford to buy a better idea then a bigger Death Star. And then they're trying to find that missing puzzle piece to find none other than... LUKE SKYWALKER!!! They find him Rey gives him the lightsaber and the movie ends. They magically blow up Starkiller Base and coincidentally they also find the last puzzle piece!<br>Now if you don't agree with me screw you. I hated this movie and I urge you to join me to hate The Force Awakens. People who hate the Last Jedi I'm with you 100%. I hate the Last Jedi. I wrote a rant for that too. But I am so sorry The Force Awakens is THE WORST movie of all time., 0.5,  Hamilton R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977165094/, March 14 2018, N/A

 The Force Awakens is a welcome return to the lived-in universe of the well-loved original trilogy. The characters are engaging the visuals are stunning and the story adeptly balances the old and the new. However the film suffers from a rehashed plot that lifts elements from A New Hope and essentially recrafts them sometimes to a fault. Though derivative TFA's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. The film manages even in the face of unprecedented hype to recapture the boundless energy that embodied the originals and was so lacking in the prequels. The Force has awakened and it's here to stay., 3.5,  Scott M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/972643831/, March 13 2018, N/A
 It has been a few years since this abomination came out. But I recently wrote a review for TLJ and I am probably going to write a review for the other SW films. But this one in particular is a horrid excuse for a film. <br><br>I will explain. First this nothing but a rehash of episode 4. But more creatively bankrupt and disgusting. And it irritates me to no end when I see/n the "apologists" for this crap over the years. The excuses that pour out of these morons are putrid! Like<br><br>"they needed to rehash it because they wanted to bring fans back that didn't like the prequels!"<br>"It needed to be done to show that SW can be exciting!" <br>"they needed to reboot it for the newer generations benefit!" <br><br><br>Even Jar Jar Abrams has admitted to rehashing it. So he basically said the he had to "play it safe" to get fans back. Uh...NO! When I see morons say how they had to "play it safe" they are just admitting that they love laziness and used ideas. Well you got another OT now you whiny rejects. Are you happy with the same crap over and over? Never mind you are! And when or if episode 10 rolls around I am very positive that they will have another trilogy of rebels vs the mighty empire. Because it is obvious that all these morons want is more of the same. <br><br>I could go on but my point is that the "apologists" bend over backwards to excuse laziness. The only obligation they had to do was to make a sequel to ROTJ. But the idiots that enjoy this drivel like being patronized by a corporate entity. They basically tried to "buy" fans back by giving them reheated left overs and calling it "new." These people who bought into it are pathetic! <br><br>Disney and LFL basically were selling the new generation used experiences. Like "hey kids? Do you want to feel the way your parents felt when the first seen SW?" This is basically robbing the newer generation of their OWN authentic experiences. That is pretty low. But since Disney and LFL apparently have no balls they just gave the world the OT 2.0. And the idiots just fell in love with the same old stuff. Some for the first time and some for the second time. With how TLJ came out they don't really do original all too well. <br><br><br>But the biggest issue for me was how they treated the force in this. MaRey Sue uses the force with 0 training. That is right. 0 training! I did pay attention to the film though. As many who claim to "love" it have not. Because it took me all but one line of dialogue to figure this out. <br><br>Kylo Ren to Snoke: She is UNTRAINED! But stronger then she knows! <br><br>See? One line of dialogue. Did that stop all the "Reytards" from wasting 2 years thinking up every excuse to try to explain how she did what she did? Nope. I had to argue for those 2 years telling these cretins that she was untrained . If they actually paid attention they wouldn't have made themselves look like tools making excuses when it was spelled out for them in the film. <br><br><br>And nice what they did to Han eh? He went back to being a smuggler. But he also became a dead beat dad too! Then killed by his own son. After knowing his son had "too much Vader" in him Han tries to talk him into coming home like he was a 10 year old that was mad because he didn't want to leave the arcade. But Han knew he wasn't coming home and I guess he got what he knew he would get. <br><br><br>And then General Leia. She was a general in the OT and also in the ST. Now that is character development right there.../S<br><br><br>Finn is the worst character in the SW universe. Well he is tied with Rose now. But in TFA he basically gets shell shock on his first mission without even firing a shot. And then he wants to run from the FO because?...Reasons? I guess this is where the new books have to be taken into account. That is what the fans of this drek seem to tell you when something doesn't get explained. You basically need a manual to watch a movie now with these new ones. I know he didn't want to kill for the FO anymore. Not that he ever did in the first place. Because Jakku was his first mission. But he will kill for anyone else without thinking twice. <br><br><br>Then we have Maz.

 This film is great in all of the following things: Acting visuals score costume design and screenplay. But all of that is ruined by J.J. Abrams lack of storytelling.

 Capturing the old Star Wars vibe cantina and all this movie continues the saga with an amazing start. Rey played by Daisy Ridley steals the show in this film followed in a close second by Harrison Ford's Han Solo the same as ever. Adam Driver and John Boyega also deliver some good performances as side characters in the movie but they play their roles very well. Oscaar Isaac has a very small role in this and while it is small he is very noteworthy in those moments.

 Where do I begin? For one I don't like any Star Wars at all. Unfortunately my wife is a huge fan so I have seen all of them. But the one movie that stood out from all was this The Force Awakens. It starts out with a brand-new droid who is supposed to be cute but is really just two spheres stacked up on each other. Kylo-Ren isn't a good villian. That is one god-ugly mask he has and. Kylo-Ren's ugly pale face is supposed to look evil. He looks like a nerd before a math test. And then as we learn in The Last Jedi he survived! Rey practically chopped off every body part he had. Now lets start with Rey. I mean I get the girl power stuff and everything. I get that a strong female character is what you should promote in a male-dominate country like the U.S.A (cough cough no female president. we elect cheese puffs instead.) But seriously? Flying the Millenium Falcon with no training? Beating a experienced fighter like Kylo-Ren on your first try lightsabering? I'm sorry but thats taking it a wee bit to far. Then there is Han Solo. I know that was supposed to make you cry because you know he commited patricide and its frickin' Han Solo. I was mad. Han Solo is the greatest Star Wars character of all time (behind Darth Vader of course!) and you just plain kill him off like THAT! He did NOTHING heroic he didn't even hold a lightsaber until Kylo-Ren stuck it through his chest. Then there's Finn. I understand Star Wars need to have a black guy in their movies because most characters are middle-aged white guys like our favorite character Kylo-Ren! But honestly Finn just dosen't have that many action moments and isn't that great a character. Then there is Po. Po has a huge ego as is confirmed in The Last Jedi. My impression of him is this: "Hi I'm Po. I'm better than all of you. I should be commander because I'm a white middle-aged guy.". As a bonus he has BB-8 on his ship beeping in a vaugely happy or scared way! And as unrealistic as ever the laser beams magically hit all the ships but Po's! Po swoops in for and unrealistic blowing up of Starkiller Base. Oh I'm sorry you said you needed a BIGGER Death Star. Come on J.J. Abrams. Star Wars is worth like a billion dollars. You can afford to buy a better idea then a bigger Death Star. And then they're trying to find that missing puzzle piece to find none other than... LUKE SKYWALKER!!! They find him Rey gives him the lightsaber and the movie ends. They magically blow up Starkiller Base and coincidentally they also find the last puzzle piece!<br>Now if you don't agree with me screw you. I hated this movie and I urge you to join me to hate The Force Awakens. People who hate the Last Jedi I'm with you 100%. I hate the Last Jedi. I wrote a rant for that too. But I am so sorry The Force Awakens is THE WORST movie of all time., 0.5,  Hamilton R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977165094/, March 14 2018, N/A

 The Force Awakens is a welcome return to the lived-in universe of the well-loved original trilogy. The characters are engaging the visuals are stunning and the story adeptly balances the old and the new. However the film suffers from a rehashed plot that lifts elements from A New Hope and essentially recrafts them sometimes to a fault. Though derivative TFA's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. The film manages even in the face of unprecedented hype to recapture the boundless energy that embodied the originals and was so lacking in the prequels. The Force has awakened and it's here to stay., 3.5,  Scott M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/972643831/, March 13 2018, N/A
 It has been a few years since this abomination came out. But I recently wrote a review for TLJ and I am probably going to write a review for the other SW films. But this one in particular is a horrid excuse for a film. <br><br>I will explain. First this nothing but a rehash of episode 4. But more creatively bankrupt and disgusting. And it irritates me to no end when I see/n the "apologists" for this crap over the years. The excuses that pour out of these morons are putrid! Like<br><br>"they needed to rehash it because they wanted to bring fans back that didn't like the prequels!"<br>"It needed to be done to show that SW can be exciting!" <br>"they needed to reboot it for the newer generations benefit!" <br><br><br>Even Jar Jar Abrams has admitted to rehashing it. So he basically said the he had to "play it safe" to get fans back. Uh...NO! When I see morons say how they had to "play it safe" they are just admitting that they love laziness and used ideas. Well you got another OT now you whiny rejects. Are you happy with the same crap over and over? Never mind you are! And when or if episode 10 rolls around I am very positive that they will have another trilogy of rebels vs the mighty empire. Because it is obvious that all these morons want is more of the same. <br><br>I could go on but my point is that the "apologists" bend over backwards to excuse laziness. The only obligation they had to do was to make a sequel to ROTJ. But the idiots that enjoy this drivel like being patronized by a corporate entity. They basically tried to "buy" fans back by giving them reheated left overs and calling it "new." These people who bought into it are pathetic! <br><br>Disney and LFL basically were selling the new generation used experiences. Like "hey kids? Do you want to feel the way your parents felt when the first seen SW?" This is basically robbing the newer generation of their OWN authentic experiences. That is pretty low. But since Disney and LFL apparently have no balls they just gave the world the OT 2.0. And the idiots just fell in love with the same old stuff. Some for the first time and some for the second time. With how TLJ came out they don't really do original all too well. <br><br><br>But the biggest issue for me was how they treated the force in this. MaRey Sue uses the force with 0 training. That is right. 0 training! I did pay attention to the film though. As many who claim to "love" it have not. Because it took me all but one line of dialogue to figure this out. <br><br>Kylo Ren to Snoke: She is UNTRAINED! But stronger then she knows! <br><br>See? One line of dialogue. Did that stop all the "Reytards" from wasting 2 years thinking up every excuse to try to explain how she did what she did? Nope. I had to argue for those 2 years telling these cretins that she was untrained . If they actually paid attention they wouldn't have made themselves look like tools making excuses when it was spelled out for them in the film. <br><br><br>And nice what they did to Han eh? He went back to being a smuggler. But he also became a dead beat dad too! Then killed by his own son. After knowing his son had "too much Vader" in him Han tries to talk him into coming home like he was a 10 year old that was mad because he didn't want to leave the arcade. But Han knew he wasn't coming home and I guess he got what he knew he would get. <br><br><br>And then General Leia. She was a general in the OT and also in the ST. Now that is character development right there.../S<br><br><br>Finn is the worst character in the SW universe. Well he is tied with Rose now.

He went back to being a smuggler. But he also became a dead beat dad too! Then killed by his own son. After knowing his son had "too much Vader" in him Han tries to talk him into coming home like he was a 10 year old that was mad because he didn't want to leave the arcade. But Han knew he wasn't coming home and I guess he got what he knew he would get. <br><br><br>And then General Leia. She was a general in the OT and also in the ST. Now that is character development right there.../S<br><br><br>Finn is the worst character in the SW universe. Well he is tied with Rose now. But in TFA he basically gets shell shock on his first mission without even firing a shot. And then he wants to run from the FO because?...Reasons? I guess this is where the new books have to be taken into account. That is what the fans of this drek seem to tell you when something doesn't get explained. You basically need a manual to watch a movie now with these new ones. I know he didn't want to kill for the FO anymore. Not that he ever did in the first place. Because Jakku was his first mission. But he will kill for anyone else without thinking twice. <br><br><br>Then we have Maz. She was the one in all her infinite wisdom to yell out "HAN SOLO!" in a crowded bar knowing he has a a price on his head and also brings BB-8 with him knowing the FO is looking for it. But back to Maz. When they are sitting at the table talking she tells all of them that they must fight the FO! Then the FO brings the fight to her doorstep. And where is big game talking Maz? Oh yeah she is hiding away somewhere. <br><br><br>But this has been long enough already. I am pretty bored just thinking about TFA. Garbage movie for garbage lovers! Oh and these new Disney movies are made for the "Veruca Salt" generation. The "I want it now" ones.<br><br>"Real sets! Practical and tangible sets"...Blah blah blah! It is hillariious how some morons bought into this. TFA was a CGI fest covered turd and the idiots bought it. Disney and co. lied to your faces! They basically bent you over and had their way with you and since you are drones you took it all and asked for seconds. SMFH... So how did all that "going back to the old school" BS work out for ya? I bet you are feeling mighty stupid right about now? Disney will keep on lying and the morons will keep buyin'!, 1.0,  Gabber C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977088517/, March 13 2018, N/A
 Nothing is Good about this film. not once scene. not even the things we love from previous films like the falcon leia han solo chewbacca luke... all those things suck in this film. it's worse than a fanfic, 0.5,  KRM K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977163180/, March 13 2018, N/A
