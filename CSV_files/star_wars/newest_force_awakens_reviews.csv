 I remember saying after my first and only viewing of this dumpster fire "If this is the direction Disney is taking Star Wars then I fear for the franchise."<br><br>After Rogue One and The Last Jedi that sentiment has only gotten stronger.

 Not a horrible movie I just don't really see the point. I think that's most people's problem with this movie that it's trying to expand on a 6 part space epic that concluded decades ago and didn't leave much room for or allude to in any way a sequel. <br><br>This movie never could've been good since had huge shoes to fill and it had to find a reason to exist since the old movies ended satisfyingly.<br><br>Genuinely though it's an ok movie with interesting characters but a couple of plot holes and not really spectacular. People's main complaint seems to be that it's largely just a reskin of ep IV. I kind of see why they did that just to play safe but I think this movie would've been better if they just totally took it in a new direction. And not created this first order/resistance conflict out of thin air.<br><br>It wasn't bad but it wasn't particularly memorable or interesting. It at least laid a good foundation of characters and a storyline for the next installments to build on but holy s**t did they screw that up. ep VIII is so bad it really makes me appreciate this one more. <br><br>It's a real shame that in the long run this series won't have much of a legacy and this one that was supposed to start it off and lay the foundation for the next will probably be the best. I'm not even going to see IX there's nothing interesting going on anymore., 2.0,  Sam O, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977081629/, February 19 2018, N/A

 J.J. Abrams gets Star Wars back to looking visually like the original trilogy which is clearly good. There's some interesting story arcs being set up ultimately ruined by the appalling and disgraceful The Last Jedi. There is however too much fan pandering and modern pop-culture moments in the movie and a lot of ethnically diverse casting just for the sake of having an ethnically diverse cast. Also the way in which the main protagonist Rey develops her force skills is poorly executed. If she had exhibited some moderate skills in the beginning when she lived alone it would have been slightly more plausible when she took on an adversary with force skill training. Overall an entertaining movie with plenty of little flaws to annoy hardcore Star Wars fans and even casual fans but not a complete disaster the disaster would follow in the form of The Last Jedi., 3.0,  Mark A, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977011461/, February 17 2018, N/A

 Completely unnecessary chapters in saga. Lack of originality trying to satisfy the hunger and desires of fans of the originals. Especially that group that cant leave 70's and 80's.

 I entered having high expectations but left disappointed. After a slow first half featuring little plot development and too many meaningless battle scenes the film does pick up momentum in the second half. But I kept thinking I had seen it all before in the previous Star Wars films. The characters the plot the plot twists the sets even the dialogue were all re-hashed. The numerous attempts at charm romance humour and wit didn't work. Even the new droid was just too cutesy. I really didn't connect with the characters and much of the acting (from both new and established actors) was average. The highest grossing film of 2015. BW.

 Initially I didn't like this movie but after watching it again I enjoyed it as a whole. Its nice to have a fresh perspective and new characters even if the story is a rehash. Honestly after the prequels we needed a rehash to reinvigorate and invite fans back. <br><br>That said I struggled in the movie the first time through. Character names weren't said right away or were said so quickly I didn't make connections. It was hard to invest in people I didn't know and that colored the whole experience. Now that I know them I can more fully enjoy it.<br><br>I was very saddened by the particular important death in this movie and i understand it but I think it could have been handled a little better. That said its a poinant moment and it hit the right chord to get its impact., 3.5,  William J, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977026279/, February 12 2018, N/A
 Although the film offers some great moments one criticism rises over the rest it's just a replica of 'A New Hope'. Sure the film was fun and entertaining but whenever I watch this film I just can't get rid of the thought I just hope that J.J. Abrams delivers with an original idea with Episode 9. After watching 'The Last Jedi' I have to give credit to the film's storytelling. The film is still great and I don't hate it but I just wish the team at Lucasfilm had been more creative with this one.

 No problem of the reworked version of a new hope for a woman. Luckily Ridley was ok. Would like to see more continuity or just better new aliens. So much better than the mess of ep8 with its political agenda and terrible story! Disney should be ashamed. <br>However if ep9 is not better which will be difficult as Kennedy and JOHNSON have killed and destroyed all that was good after 40 years of heavy investment I will be out! <br>Interesting that it shows the critics are on board with the political agenda too the audience score says it all about ep8.

 The Force Awakens is a welcome return to the lived-in universe of the well-loved original trilogy. The characters are engaging the visuals are stunning and the story adeptly balances the old and the new. However the film suffers from a rehashed plot that lifts elements from A New Hope and essentially recrafts them sometimes to a fault. Though derivative TFA's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. The film manages even in the face of unprecedented hype to recapture the boundless energy that embodied the originals and was so lacking in the prequels. The Force has awakened and it's here to stay., 3.5,  Scott M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/972643831/, March 13 2018, N/A
 It has been a few years since this abomination came out. But I recently wrote a review for TLJ and I am probably going to write a review for the other SW films. But this one in particular is a horrid excuse for a film. <br><br>I will explain. First this nothing but a rehash of episode 4. But more creatively bankrupt and disgusting. And it irritates me to no end when I see/n the "apologists" for this crap over the years. The excuses that pour out of these morons are putrid! Like<br><br>"they needed to rehash it because they wanted to bring fans back that didn't like the prequels!"<br>"It needed to be done to show that SW can be exciting!" <br>"they needed to reboot it for the newer generations benefit!" <br><br><br>Even Jar Jar Abrams has admitted to rehashing it. So he basically said the he had to "play it safe" to get fans back. Uh...NO! When I see morons say how they had to "play it safe" they are just admitting that they love laziness and used ideas. Well you got another OT now you whiny rejects. Are you happy with the same crap over and over? Never mind you are! And when or if episode 10 rolls around I am very positive that they will have another trilogy of rebels vs the mighty empire. Because it is obvious that all these morons want is more of the same. <br><br>I could go on but my point is that the "apologists" bend over backwards to excuse laziness. The only obligation they had to do was to make a sequel to ROTJ. But the idiots that enjoy this drivel like being patronized by a corporate entity. They basically tried to "buy" fans back by giving them reheated left overs and calling it "new." These people who bought into it are pathetic! <br><br>Disney and LFL basically were selling the new generation used experiences. Like "hey kids? Do you want to feel the way your parents felt when the first seen SW?" This is basically robbing the newer generation of their OWN authentic experiences. That is pretty low. But since Disney and LFL apparently have no balls they just gave the world the OT 2.0. And the idiots just fell in love with the same old stuff. Some for the first time and some for the second time. With how TLJ came out they don't really do original all too well. <br><br><br>But the biggest issue for me was how they treated the force in this. MaRey Sue uses the force with 0 training. That is right. 0 training! I did pay attention to the film though. As many who claim to "love" it have not. Because it took me all but one line of dialogue to figure this out. <br><br>Kylo Ren to Snoke: She is UNTRAINED! But stronger then she knows! <br><br>See? One line of dialogue. Did that stop all the "Reytards" from wasting 2 years thinking up every excuse to try to explain how she did what she did? Nope. I had to argue for those 2 years telling these cretins that she was untrained . If they actually paid attention they wouldn't have made themselves look like tools making excuses when it was spelled out for them in the film. <br><br><br>And nice what they did to Han eh? He went back to being a smuggler. But he also became a dead beat dad too! Then killed by his own son. After knowing his son had "too much Vader" in him Han tries to talk him into coming home like he was a 10 year old that was mad because he didn't want to leave the arcade. But Han knew he wasn't coming home and I guess he got what he knew he would get. <br><br><br>And then General Leia. She was a general in the OT and also in the ST. Now that is character development right there.../S<br><br><br>Finn is the worst character in the SW universe. Well he is tied with Rose now. But in TFA he basically gets shell shock on his first mission without even firing a shot. And then he wants to run from the FO because?...Reasons? I guess this is where the new books have to be taken into account. That is what the fans of this drek seem to tell you when something doesn't get explained. You basically need a manual to watch a movie now with these new ones. I know he didn't want to kill for the FO anymore. Not that he ever did in the first place. Because Jakku was his first mission. But he will kill for anyone else without thinking twice. <br><br><br>Then we have Maz. She was the one in all her infinite wisdom to yell out "HAN SOLO!" in a crowded bar knowing he has a a price on his head and also brings BB-8 with him knowing the FO is looking for it. But back to Maz. When they are sitting at the table talking she tells all of them that they must fight the FO! Then the FO brings the fight to her doorstep. And where is big game talking Maz? Oh yeah she is hiding away somewhere. <br><br><br>But this has been long enough already. I am pretty bored just thinking about TFA. Garbage movie for garbage lovers! Oh and these new Disney movies are made for the "Veruca Salt" generation. The "I want it now" ones.<br><br>"Real sets! Practical and tangible sets"...Blah blah blah! It is hillariious how some morons bought into this. TFA was a CGI fest covered turd and the idiots bought it. Disney and co. lied to your faces! They basically bent you over and had their way with you and since you are drones you took it all and asked for seconds. SMFH... So how did all that "going back to the old school" BS work out for ya?

 A New Hope for Star Wars<br>The copycatting of A New Hope starts the moment the opening crawl starts and we are supposed to accept that the New Republic government is actually the Resistance and in an underdog position to the First Order (who are in fact the real rebels in this case) and continues with a hero on a desert planet (that it is not Tatooine in this case only makes it more obvious to me). Is that a problem? Hell no! Star Wars is back and all is forgiven.<br>The story may not be super original but it does a good job introducing the new characters and linking them to the old characters in a story that passes the torch of heroism from the old to the new generation. Visuals sounds locations spaceships creatures and droids are everything you would expect from a Star Wars movie and the new cast makes a strong impression. Are there any doubts? Well yes. Kylo Ren makes a very good first impression as the new villain but actually becomes weaker as the movie progresses losing to brand new untrained and unguided force user Rey in a mental and later a lightsaber duel. But he seems to have a soft spot for Rey somehow and was just wounded by Chewbacca after killing his father when the lightsaber dual went down right? Also there must be something we don't know about Rey that explains not so much her sensitivity to the force as her ability to use it right? We can forget all that for now and just enjoy the ride answers will be provided further along in the new trilogy. And a good ride it is even after watching it several times in theaters and at home!<br> As you've probably guessed I'm writing this review after seeing The Last Jedi but also after re-watching The Force Awakens after that again and I'm happy to say that I still like it enough to give it 5 stars. I believe it deserves that as a reboot of the Star Wars saga and a first chapter of a new trilogy. In a well thought out trilogy the first chapter needs to leave us with some questions unanswered as a setup for the story lines of the next chapters., 5.0,  Farth D, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977150277/, March 6 2018, N/A
 This movie is rated better than prequels? I don't agree.<br><br>If you belong to the audience that tends to spend money on movies like Avengers or Transformers it is not a big surprise that you won't mind the plot holes or the unoriginality of this movie. I congratulate you! You were J. J. Abram's targeted audience and you are in the majority of the people. But once you find passion for cinematography and narrative you might find some of the choices done by directors like J. J. Abrams not to your liking. It's like that in all forms of art.<br><br>The question we should all ask ourselves should be: <br>- Do we want an art that: <br>1. tries to imitate proven old things works on nostalgy and generally tries to attract the widest audience by employing simple techniques or...<br>2. ...or do we want an art that delves into the unknown works on imagination and generally tries to distinguish itself from all the rest?<br>I know my answer.

 A retelling of a new Hope with good questions the last Jedi destroyed :-) What luck I have since 1977 that the following films were good :-) With the precuels began the bad writing. When Disney bought Star Wars I got scared but TFA was not bad and Rogue One was great. I thought - luckily - Disney is going the right way :-) And then came The last Jedi and my fear was confirmed. I guessed that Disney's comic Mary Sue - I can do it all right now - transmits cartoons to Star Wars movies.<br>So sad so sad ... bring back my beloved Luke.... <br><br>or let him most honorably die for the old and new audience. But too late :-) All new Star Wars fans I wish a lot of fun with the knowledge that you will never get the good feeling of the old fans of 1977.

 This movie was garbage both as a movie on its own and as a Star Wars movie. It is an empty husk of a plot as a sterile corporate money grab. I would rather drink my own vomit while watching the prequels than seeing this dumpster fire again. The prequels are masterpieces and premium content compared to this.<br><br>There is no plot and the only non-flat character is the bad guy. The movie only superficially copies the original and shows a lack of understanding what actually made it a worthwhile movie. It wasn't a scoundrel it was a scoundrel growing and changing and seeing more and more of a complex character than there is at the start. Luke grows from a whiny orphan to seeing his murdered aunt and uncle and watching his recently father figure be murdered in front of his eyes and taking on the mantle of a cause. And his use of the force was reasonable to not getting shocked with child training and shooting torpedoes not duel the most powerful force user and saber wielder in the galaxy.<br><br>This is just the start. If you liked this film I take your opinion of what entertainment to see as what to avoid since you can tolerate empty vacuous pieces of garbage and think it anything but worse than worthless. Everyone that was within 100 miles of something that had any part in making of this film should be ashamed of themselves and go become a sanitation worker then they would at least be productive when shoveling feces.<br><br>I will no longer watch any new Star Wars entertainment that have a release date after this and I would only think about it if people that wish the creators involved in this movie ceased to exist in time loved that future movie.

 This film is great in all of the following things: Acting visuals score costume design and screenplay. But all of that is ruined by J.J. Abrams lack of storytelling.

 Reviewed 12.14.17. Another Death Star? Really another darn Death Star? The lack of originality in the script would be enough alone to sink most movies. Yet it survives and dare I say even thrives. Why? A combination of deep nostalgia and excellent pacing. For every moment where I cringed (hokey usage of previous Star War's lines implausible relocation of characters from frame to frame and oh did I mention a THIRD DEATH STAR?!) there was something funny or amusing. For a viewer new to the series it might not resonate.

 Don't have a clue how it has been rated so high. The movie seemed very slapped together with terrible actor choices for characters. Nothing against Adam Driver but when he removed his mask as Kylo Renn I literally could not stop laughing dude looks much more like a Geek Squad member than a sith lord. Also an example of the plot being slapped together is how Rey somehow is a badass overnight when in the past we see Luke Skywalker and even the badass Darth Vader spent years mastering their skills and abilities.

Adam Driver and John Boyega also deliver some good performances as side characters in the movie but they play their roles very well.

 Where do I begin? For one I don't like any Star Wars at all. Unfortunately my wife is a huge fan so I have seen all of them. But the one movie that stood out from all was this The Force Awakens. It starts out with a brand-new droid who is supposed to be cute but is really just two spheres stacked up on each other. Kylo-Ren isn't a good villian. That is one god-ugly mask he has and. Kylo-Ren's ugly pale face is supposed to look evil. He looks like a nerd before a math test. And then as we learn in The Last Jedi he survived! Rey practically chopped off every body part he had. Now lets start with Rey. I mean I get the girl power stuff and everything. I get that a strong female character is what you should promote in a male-dominate country like the U.S.A (cough cough no female president. we elect cheese puffs instead.) But seriously? Flying the Millenium Falcon with no training? Beating a experienced fighter like Kylo-Ren on your first try lightsabering? I'm sorry but thats taking it a wee bit to far. Then there is Han Solo. I know that was supposed to make you cry because you know he commited patricide and its frickin' Han Solo. I was mad. Han Solo is the greatest Star Wars character of all time (behind Darth Vader of course!) and you just plain kill him off like THAT! He did NOTHING heroic he didn't even hold a lightsaber until Kylo-Ren stuck it through his chest. Then there's Finn. I understand Star Wars need to have a black guy in their movies because most characters are middle-aged white guys like our favorite character Kylo-Ren! But honestly Finn just dosen't have that many action moments and isn't that great a character. Then there is Po. Po has a huge ego as is confirmed in The Last Jedi. My impression of him is this: "Hi I'm Po. I'm better than all of you. I should be commander because I'm a white middle-aged guy.". As a bonus he has BB-8 on his ship beeping in a vaugely happy or scared way! And as unrealistic as ever the laser beams magically hit all the ships but Po's! Po swoops in for and unrealistic blowing up of Starkiller Base. Oh I'm sorry you said you needed a BIGGER Death Star. Come on J.J. Abrams. Star Wars is worth like a billion dollars. You can afford to buy a better idea then a bigger Death Star. And then they're trying to find that missing puzzle piece to find none other than... LUKE SKYWALKER!!! They find him Rey gives him the lightsaber and the movie ends. They magically blow up Starkiller Base and coincidentally they also find the last puzzle piece!<br>Now if you don't agree with me screw you. I hated this movie and I urge you to join me to hate The Force Awakens. People who hate the Last Jedi I'm with you 100%. I hate the Last Jedi. I wrote a rant for that too.

 THE ONLY MOVIE I WALKED OUT OF EVER!! <br><br>I was too young when the original (Ep. III) came out. However when I was 8 I had one of my favorite childhood memories happen watching The Empire Strikes Back. I remember strutting out of the theater like I was part of the Rebels. After watching Empire MY MIND WAS BLOWN!!! I pretended that I was Luke for weeks. We all played Rebels vs. The Empire forever as kids. I still have have all the original toys..(wish I took better care of them...lol). I would say The Star Wars saga was most likely in the top 3 most popular pieces of media I had growing up. <br><br>Anyways I went to see The Farce Awakens a few weeks after the hoopla. I kept all the reviews and any input positive or negative away from me. This way I could see it "fresh" and with no preconceptions. I could not wait..I had soo much anticipation. I was psyched for this one! I had the best seat in the house. Under 10 people in theater no kids with me or wife. No distractions at all. Just me the HUGE IMAX screen and a beloved childhood friend i hadn't seen in years.<br><br>After suffering though the prequels I really hoped J.J. Abrams would bring the prestige of this fantastic franchise back. I have never been a huge fan of J.J. Binks...I mean Abrams..sorry however I did like what he did with the Star Trek series. I am not so much of a fanboy to know about Kathleen Kennedy and all the politics behind Disney Lucas Films...etc. prior to watching it. I did know Disney paid Lucas $4 Billion for the franchise so I expected that for a company to spend that much money for something they would take great care of it and make it the best it possibly could be.....BOY WAS I WRONG!<br><br>About 3/4 through the movie I abruptly stood up and walked out of the movie shaking my head mumbling and asking why to the attendants that worked there... "Why...why..why???" Some looked at me like I was crazy but a few I could tell understood my perplexion. The lead Daisy "Mary Sue" Ridley who can do literally anything. Seriously anything. She even shows Han Solo how to fix his ship after being in it for 2 mins. ..really. This is not why I left however it and a few other things only built on this foundation to my departure. It was when Mary Sue....hmmph ...I mean Daisy fights with Kylo "Emo" Renn..No $% she keeps up with him. His moniker within the First order is "Jedi Killer". He is the (SPOILER) the grandson of Darth Vader for $% sake. He was personally trained by LUKE! She almost beats him. She wounds him quite severely though. Her training you ask? She held a lightsaber for only a few moments in a basement of a Rebel bar 10 mins. before this scene. Literally just holding it...not training or learning how to use it...just holding it (ok..sorry she did have a "Force Projection" while holding it but technically she still was just holding it). . Also during the fight Finn (a Stormtrooper Janitor..I'm not kidding he was a janitor.. that found out killing was bad during his first battle he switches sides and starts killing other people 10 mins. later) he also gives Renn a run for his money. Oh I'm sorry I did not mention this but he also is involved in a lightsaber battle with the leader of The First Order. He does pretty well too until as it should be with such a lopsided fight he gets pretty hurt. I walked out at this point. Mary Sue almosts beats Kylo (one of the strongest Force Users in the Star Wars Universe).<br><br>Some of us may remember the question or statement (depending on what side you were on) "Can I borrow your homework to copy it?" and you respond "yeah no problemo..just change it up a bit so the teacher doesn't catch it". Well Abrams took A New Hope and changed some of the names sizes of weapons and planets....and Voila!!! A Force Awakens is made. He literally copies and pastes A New Hope to make A FARCE Awakens. Thoroughly disappointed almost to tears. Why are people soooooo dumb and actually like this movie? I don't get it. I predict Kennedy will be fired within the next 4 years Solo will completely flop and unfortunately the whole franchise will fall apart. If you want a chuckle watch Hamill's interviews about The last Jedi. Screw you Disney Kennedy SJW's and Mary Sue!

Abrams installment is not the true powerful awakening it could have been.

 A successful comeback for George Lucas' iconic saga that was nothing like the trashy prequels and a much needed re-invantion of the franchise that obviously relies on nostalgia and takes much inspiration from Lucas' original trilogy.

 With respect that this was a needed soft reboot I thoroughly enjoyed this film and it quickly made it's way into one of my favorite Star Wars films.

 I'm not bandwagoning this film like a few others just because Star Wars fans are blinded by nostalgia over the amount of fan service shoehorned all throughout this movie. This movie Avengers: Age of Ultron and The Last Jedi prove to everyone that box-office success is very deceiving. J.J. Abrams copied the plot of A New Hope for the second half of this film and I find the Disney humor in these newer Star Wars films to be quite cringe-worthy at times. They made Rey out to be a Mary Sue in this trilogy right from the start. Sure Rey can be a good mechanic as shown in the beginning of the film but there's a huge difference between fixing and piloting. How does she know how to fly? That was never mentioned or explained. It's implied in A New Hope that Anakin Skywalker was the best starfighter pilot in the galaxy as stated by Obi-Wan and in the prequels it showed with a valid explanation. Rey was even able to successfully resist Kylo Ren when he tried infiltrating her mind after the capture. How could she do this with no training whatsoever? She could even use Jedi mind-tricks on stormtroopers with no training either.<br><br>How is this possible? Does she study and practice the force in her own free time? She didn't even believe it to be real until Han Solo said it was on the Millennium Falcon. Luke Skywalker didn't use mind-tricks on anyone until Return of the Jedi when he was more experienced with his force powers.? Nothing was explained about the old man Lor San Tekka at the beginning of TFA or in TLJ even. All of it was even worse in The Last Jedi. Rey grew up on a desert planet but knows how to swim in The Last Jedi. She's great at fixing the Millennium Falcon and can fly it just as good as Han Solo. She took on three to four praetorian guards in TLJ despite no training with the actual lightsaber whatsoever. In that same scene Kylo Ren didn't even use any of his force powers. Kylo can stop a blaster shot in mid-air and can paralyze anyone but can't defeat a desert girl with his force powers alone? She even did just fine against Luke Skywalker in a fifteen second duel. At the end of TLJ Rey was able to conveniently lift dozens of rocks to save what was left of the Resistance despite Luke Skywalker struggling to lift his own x-wing out of the swamp with Yoda in Empire Strikes Back. This is all what you call plot convenience. Even when you're injured you can still use your force powers against anyone which Kylo did not against Rey in The Force Awakens. There is no continuity in Episodes VII and VIII.

 Star Wars: The Force Awakens a direct sequel to the original Star Wars trilogy revitalizes the franchise delivering an exciting and action-packed space adventure. In the wake of the disappearance of Luke Skywalker the last Jedi Knight two rival factions the Resistance and the First Order chase after a driod that contains a map to Skywalker's secret location. The plot is quite similar to that of the first Star Wars changing out the Death Star plans for a map Darth Vader for Kylo Ren and a naïve farm boy for a scavenger. Yet it still has its own style and tone that both homages the original trilogy and does its own thing. Additionally newcomer Daisy Ridley has great screen presence and gives a strong performance. Also the special effects are incredibly well-done as are the sets and costumes. With Star Wars: The Force Awakens J.J.

 I had to come back and re-do my review I had given this movie 3 1/2 stars it wasn't the best Star Wars but it was better than the prequels however now that The Last Jedi been foisted upon the masses and having seen that abomination I tried to watch The Force Awakens again and TLJ made this movie even worse. Now that I know that there is completely zero continuity between the two movies and that every plot thread setup in FA now has no meaning no pay off.... this movie now SUX just not quite as as bad as TLJ I rank it now somewhere equal with Attack of the Clones while TLJ now takes up the very bottom. So disgusted with what this production crew has done to Star Wars I am now just an Ep 1-6 watcher I will no longer support this franchise with patronage., 1.5,  Jack S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977069888/, February 1 2018, N/A

 Entertaining but basically a composite of the original trilogy that introduced the new characters and laid out story points for them to grab our interest. I thought it a waste to do so little with 33% of the story time in the new trilogy. I found it much better than TPM (Episode I of the prequel) but its hard to dislike what is essentially the story of the original trilogy with some new characters., 2.5,  Donald W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/951345489/, January 31 2018, N/A
 Tonally it's a star wars movie. Plot wise it's a soft reboot of "A New Hope"<br>I'm sure there was a lot of pressure on JJ Abrams to not sink Disney's first Star Wars venture and this movie plays it very safe. So much so that as a fan of the originals I was disappointed that it was such a heightened repeat of the original. It was fun though and tonally the characters and most of the dialog was on point. The story arc was lame and clearly a set up that was meant to appease older fans while setting the table for the next movie., 2.5,  Jim F, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/904370784/, January 30 2018, N/A

 Great movie. Didn't really watch much of 4-6 so I don't even have the complaints of "re-hashing" or anything. As far as I'm aware you can just skip 4 and watch this one instead.

 This is an incredibly entertaining movie. For fans of Star Wars this movie ticks all the boxes and introduces new characters and a new growing threat.<br>Abrams being a Star Wars fan himself made this movie to cater to the mass of fans which it does admirably. The story is similar and the ending is nothing new but he never hovers over either long. He understands that this franchise is built on the rebellion and the characters we follow. The return of the millennium falcon Han and Chewie is welcome to Star Wars fans. We get to spend some much needed time with our beloved heroes as they seek to help out the rebellion/resistance.<br>The film relies on Hans charisma a lot of the time and he really shines pulling on the heart strings right up until the end.<br><br>The major issues with the prequels were around Jedi's the force and the dark side. Abrams gets it spot on! Unlike the heavily choreographed fight scenes from the prequels we are treated to visceral sabre swinging that is full of tension and high stakes with neither character giving an inch.<br>It is one of the highlights of a film filled with highlights but mainly it is the look and feel of this film that is the triumph.<br>Real sets and real characters interacting with each other better dialogue story-lines that are filled with promise and a mysterious dark side to be discovered making this an overwhelming treat.<br><br>Yes this film feels like it plays on nostalgia which it does but it does not rely on it. For Star Wars fans I have said that a few times and i can't stress it enough "fans" not casual viewers real fans that grew up with the original movies. This is the film that George did not deliver the film the phantom Menace should have been. Yes it is a re-boot but Star Wars needed that.<br><br>Fans want more of these films. They play them to their kids and their kids want more of these movies. The problem is to judge these films as anything more than entertainment...Star Wars is a blockbuster movie franchise to enjoy in a theatre with friends and family tucking into a tub of popcorn pure escapism.<br><br>And for 2hrs and 16mins this film reminded me of being an excited little kid escaping the real world for a couple of hours., 4.0,  Anthony G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976961223/, January 24 2018, N/A

 This is the Star Wars movie we expected. With a new cast some familiar faces and a great plot The Force Awakens definitely renews the Star Wars saga. Speaking of the new cast their performance was incredible it was simply outstanding. Although The Force Awakens may share some similarities with A New Hope it's only through the visuals as the plot is original and new. Rey the main character of the film needs more flaws. She isn't perfect but definitely has way too many skills. Despite this The Force Awaken's story is enjoyable outrageously fun and emotionally nostalgic., 5.0,  Mason S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976848925/, January 22 2018, N/A

 I had to come here and review this after registering for Rotten Tomatoes just to vent on how awful the Last Jedi was truly a turkey which deserves to go down as the worst Star Wats movie ever. Thing is when I originally seen Force Awakens for the first time I felt the same. I hated it's rehashed New Hope plot lines and would have given it a 1 star for it's efforts. However after witnessing the abomination that was Last Jedi I find myself coming back to realise that Force Awakens whilst a retreat is a much superior and fully rounded movie that at least felt like Star Wars should. It set up some interesting plot lines which were dismissed in Last Jedi. So for me it has easily earned another 2 stars compared to Last Jedi. As at least it wasn't the convoluted badly edited mess of it's related second act. Force Awakens is no masterpiece either but has gone up in most people's expectations since part 2 came out. Overall the whole story was badly setup and executed from Luke Leia and Han not meeting before Ian's death to a retreat of evil empire rising again and the failed Solo family project. But from the point of view of the end of Force Awakens it was still retrievable with a strong part 2 which didn't happen. The whole saga is poisoned now with Last Jedi and there is no way back., 3.0,  Dave A, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977067973/, January 22 2018, N/A
 Really I can't believe so many people liked this piece of trash ... With the worst Hero ever presented the worst villain for any Star Wars movie really bad acting from the main character and also Leia what happen to her? Was she under medication? This movie is just a really bad copy of "A New Hope" but when I say bad I mean just trash ... The only thing that could fix this would be that the main characters both die in the next movie or even better just make them dissapear and just talk us about Luke. I think the only good part of the movie is Han saying to Chewie "We're back home" .... and the answer would be "No you are not Han no you're not", ,  Jorge L, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977067811/, January 21 2018, N/A

 The Farce Awakens is a soulless revival of a beloved franchise complete with retreading of old plot uninspired copy and pasted villains in The First Order/Empire-lite and a Mary Sue protagonist named Rey that's so blatant you will have no sense of thrill at all watching her journey simply from the sheer thickness of her plot-armor. Rey's complete lack of a hero's journey and her ability to overcome every obstacle no matter the odds alone damns her but the endless lore related accomplishments and powers simply lavished on her by the writer throughout the film makes The Farce Awakens far more difficult to watch than if she had simply stumbled her way to so much success. <br><br>Jar Jar Abrams has gone on record saying that this movie was written in such a way as to ease people back into the Star Wars franchise and saying so speaks volumes as to just how much he either doesn't understand people or how he intended to try and crib success from the older films in order to play it safe for himself. Fans won't want to see a rehashed story as they can just watch the old films if they want to see that story again.<br><br>The Farce Awakens is to put it bluntly a massive disappointment in the history of Star Wars., 0.5,  Merlos T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977066629/, January 21 2018, N/A

 I have mixed feelings about The Force Awakens. Abrahams did a good job bringing back that Star Wars feel lots of epic flying and swash buckling. Some scenes need to be watched in the cinema to get fully appreciated like the X-wings approaching over the lake for their attack run or the Millenium Falcon flying arond the star destroyer wreck. On the downside I find the storyline lacking and acting of the new main characters Finn and Rey not convincing. Another thing missing is the richness of new worlds and the design of space ships George Lucas is famous for. It's all missing here just old stuff made bigger. Abrahams made a good attempt but he can do better if he wants., 3.0,  Hans E, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/912306487/, January 20 2018, N/A

 The Force Awakens continues to make the Star Wars franchise one of the best movie franchise of all time and my favorite movie franchise of all time. Not only does this new movie feature my favorite characters and actors from the first three (Carrie Fisher as Leia and Harrison Ford as Han) but it add some of the most amazing new characters to the franchise.

 For those praising this film <br><br>Star Wars Episode 7 is a despicable corporate product of a movie that leeches off the imagination of the man who created its universe while simultaneously giving him a giant middle finger by erasing all remnants of his Prequel Trilogy and turning the franchise into a vehicle for pandering fan service and a "progressive" feminist agenda. <br><br>Episode 7 is nothing but glorified fan fiction made by a corporation desperate to get a return on their investment. With years of careful risk-benefit analysis they were able to produce a film that upset the least amount of the rabid vicious "original fan base" as possible.<br><br>So "fans" you got everything you wanted. George Lucas and the prequels are but a memory and you get all your original toys back with just enough new crap to fool you into thinking your experiencing something fresh. You'll see the next 20 Star Wars movies and you'll get everything you begged to have but you'll never be surprised. <br><br>When Lucas wrote the script for A New Hope he wasn't trying to please anyone but himself. He wasn't feeding a hungry mob everything they wanted he was crafting a story that he wanted to see told on film. After 6 great chapters he finished his story. So enjoy Disney's Star Wars movies until the end of time but just remember that you're never going to see a film series so daring ambitious and above all entertaining as George Lucas' Star Wars., 0.5,  Jared P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/913129597/, January 17 2018, N/A

 The Force Awakens many people complained it was too much like A New Hope. Sure it had it similarities but I enjoyed it a lot. The way the new characters were introduced was very well done. It brought them in with strength and helped really give us a look at their lives. The depth of the story and how the characters were built up really helped strengthen the film. It gave us a good amount of time to see their backstories or hear about their backstories prior to the climatic scenes toward the end of the film. The way they portrayed Han was well-done and as always enjoyable. He went out with a bang and definitely helped build up Kylo Ren. The only two complaints I have are how quick Rey harnessed some of the powers of the force and Chewie and Leia didn't embrace after Han's death. Now to me it was a seamless transistion from ROTJ to TFA. It gave forth to a new series of characters and struggles while continuing to develop old characters that were portrayed in an amazing light. Overall TFA is one of my favorite in the franchise and definitely feel it deserves to be in the Canon and franchise of Star Wars, 4.5,  Justin S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/898425014/, January 9 2018, N/A

 30 years after the original trilogy GG Abrahms made a copy of A New Hope a new Death Star/Planet base which fires giant lasers and destroys planets but in stronger of course. A Mary Sue like Rey (too perfect) and a Storm Trooper who is the only one in tens of thousands of soldiers to betray the First Order a new R2-D2 the death of Han Solo just like Kenobi and the abusive use of lens flares (#GGABRAHMS) all of that made that movie suck. I just hope that the next one will bring new things into Star Wars and takes risks instead of taking the same script and just changing the names and the cast. 2 stars for the new lightsaber and the special effects., 2.0,  Titouan C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977040204/, January 8 2018, N/A
 Lo primero es lo primero. Amigo sí está película es mejor que las precuelas y es una digna sucesora de la trilogía original. Ya puedes respirar tranquilo. Ahora al lío.<br><br>Este séptimo episodio es una película que sin duda se ha rodado con un mimo y un cuidado especial que tiene unas soberbias interpretaciones unos set pieces de acción magníficos un diseño de producción exquisito y una banda sonora que es para llorar. Pero eso no quita que existan ciertos problemillas minúsculos.<br><br>Se nota mucho la mano de Disney especialmente en el miedo que tenían al tratar la película. No hay ideas innovadoras no hay nada arriesgado y las tramas y estructuras del guión son terroríficamente idénticas a Una Nueva Esperanza. También hay que decir que el guión en algunos momentos hace aguas y por ello ciertas tramas de personaje sufren. Pero también es cierto que tenemos dos películas más para rellanar esos agujeros así no tenemos que esperar nada muy malo aun., 4.0,  Samuel M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/903562580/, January 8 2018, N/A
 Unoriginal plot. Great new characters introduced but Rey is a master without any real training whatsoever. She hasn't earned anything yet. I really like Fin and the idea of a defected storm trooper. Kylo Ren is a pretty scary villain and has a great screen presence. Han Solo's character was disrespected and this movie pretty much makes everything that was accomplished in the original trilogy meaningless. This was a cash cow and very manipulative marketing to lure us in., 1.5,  Kevin C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/915436355/, January 7 2018, N/A

 First off I'd like to say that overall I found it to be a pretty entertaining movie. I mean other than the 5 seconds of it that made it the worst Star Wars movie ever (I'll expand on that later). It had great special effects the dogfights and action sequences were pretty cool and the concept of the Starkiller Base was interesting (although it was just a huge Death Star made from a planet). The casting was good for the most part and it was friggin' awesome to see Han Solo back in action. There was a lot of good humor throughout the movie too (mostly thanks to Han). They introduced some decent characters to the Star Wars universe in Finn and Rey. I don't know enough about Poe to really inform an opinion. He was alright but pretty one-dimensional. The new little droid BB-8 was okay but seemed more like an R2-D2 knockoff who gets around by way of a soccer ball. <br><br>So on the face of it I'd recommend it. But when I start analyzing from a storytelling or writing perspective that's where I get very nit-picky. And honestly the more I nit-picked the more there was to nit-pick. If you haven't seen the movie yet then you might want to stop reading now because I'm about to give away a LOT of SPOILERS. <br><br>Now that you've been warned we can begin. I noticed throughout the movie a lot of similarities between this one and Episode 4. See if this sounds familiar: A member of the Resistance (Rebellion) has sensitive data that the First Order (Empire) wants. The village (ship) sheltering him is attacked by First Order Stormtroopers (Imperial Stormtroopers) led by Kylo Ren (Darth Vader) a Dark Side Force-user. During the attack the Resistance member Poe Dameron (Princess Leia) gives the sensitive data to his trusted droid BB-8 (R2-D2) to keep it safe. The Resistance (Rebellion) member is captured by the Dark Side Force-user but the droid escapes. The droid is left alone on the desert planet of Jakku (Tattooine) until it conveniently ends up in the custody of a Force sensitive human named Rey (Luke Skywalker). Poe (Leia) is interrogated to find out the location of the sensitive data that the First Order wants. Finn (also Luke Skywalker) who's not officially a member of the Resistance (Rebellion) is dressed up in a Stormtrooper uniform to help Poe (Leia) escape the clutches of their captors. The Force sensitive local Rey (Luke) escapes the First Order (Empire) on the desert planet with BB-8 (R2-D2) on the Millennium Falcon (Millennium Falcon). Anakin Skywalker's old lightsaber is stored in a chest and offered to the Force sensitive Rey (Luke) by the bizarre old coot Maz (Ben Kenobi). The First Order (Empire) uses Starkiller Base (Death Star) to blow up a planets (Alderaan) to send a message to the rest of the galaxy. The Resistance (Rebellion) has to destroy the Starkiller Base (Death Star) before it blows up the planet D'Qar (Yavin IV) where their main base is stationed and they send a small squadron of X-Wings (X-Wings and Y-Wings) to do it. Han Solo (Obi-Wan Kenobi) the mentor figure to the Force sensitive newcomer is cut down by the Dark Side Force-user Kylo Ren (Darth Vader) on Starkiller Base (Death Star). An X-Wing is able to destroy the mega-battle station right before it's ready to fire at the Resistance (Rebellion) planet of D'Qar (Yavin IV) where Princess Leia (Episode IV and VII) is located during the attack. <br>If you watched episodes 4 5 6 and 7 in a row 3 out of 4 movies have the good guys trying to destroy a battle station that blows up planets. They even slightly address it in the movie being like "Well we've done this before. Let's just dust off one of the old plans and do that again." Which they pretty much did. It's time to start thinking outside the box. Because I swear if Episode 8 starts off on an ice planet... Despite it being the exact same goal of the Rebellion in episodes 4 and 6 it wasn't the main plot of this movie. It was more of a side story just thrown in there. I remember being like an hour into the movie not really sure where it was going when all of a sudden this giant laser they carved into a planet is activated and destroys a system of planets. I do like the idea for making the weapon part of a planet and that it recharges itself by sucking the energy straight from suns. Too bad it wasn't used in Episode 6. <br><br>Then there's Kylo Ren who turns out to be Han and Leia's son. He was a Jedi who turned to the Dark Side. Leia tells Han that if he sees their son to bring him back because "There's still good in him." Now where have I heard THAT before? I know when George Lucas was in control of the movies he liked repeating themes but come on! Disney seemingly bought the Star Wars franchise to take creative control away from George Lucas (and to make lots and lots of money) and then all they did was steal his ideas and reuse them!<br><br>But like I said earlier blowing up Starkiller Base wasn't even the main goal of the film. That piece of sensitive data BB-8 had was part of a map that leads to Luke Skywalker who went into seclusion after his nephew killed all the Jedi he was training. Now both the First Order and the Resistance are looking for him for different reasons. It turns out some old man at the beginning of the movie had one piece of the map and R2-D2 (who's been in sleep mode since Luke left) had the other part. What I'd like to know is who made this map? Did Luke make the map ahead of time saying "This is where I intend to go and how I intend to get there. But I don't want anyone to find me so I'm going to split the map into two pieces instead of not making it in the first place"? R2 randomly pops out of sleep mode at the end of the movie and shows everyone his half of the map. So if he went in sleep mode after Luke left it would stand to reason that someone (Luke!) gave him an incomplete map of where Luke was going before he left. Did someone else track down Luke's movements and slip half the map into R2 memory while he was asleep and gave the other half to some old man (an old man that they never really explain who he was or why he had the other half of the map)? Seriously. Who made the map and why did it get split up? Maybe I wasn't paying attention but that didn't seem to be explained at all. And why do you need a map to a planet? It's space! It's not like a treasure map where you have to "go left at the skull shaped rock and through the waterfall". You pop in the coordinates for the planet and bang! You're there...which is exactly what happened. They put the pieces of the map together and Rey gets in the Falcon travels at lightspeed for 3 seconds and arrives at Luke's hideout. Pretty convenient that she knew exactly where to land on an entire planet and found him within minutes of arriving... <br><br>Going back to Kylo Ren he seems to be in conflict with the sides of the Force. So he talks to the mangled helmet of his grandfather Darth Vader to look for strength. He wants to stay on the Dark Side but he admits he feels the pull of the Light. He says to the helmet "I will finish what you started." Uhhh what? Did no one tell Kylo that his grandfather eventually returned to the Light Side and threw the Emperor down a shaft to his death? You'd think Luke would've told his nephew that considering he was there...<br><br>Rey is another new Force sensitive character introduced in the movie. She turns out to be quite adept at using it which is impressive considering just the day before she thought that the Force and Jedi were myths. But within moments of Kylo Ren using the Force on her she's able to read his mind Jedi mind trick a Stormtrooper into releasing her from captivity and out-Force pull a lightsaber away from Kylo Ren (a guy who's been training with the Force for years). I already knew she could handle herself with a staff so I won't make a big fuss about her lightsaber skills (although she is inexplicably good with a blaster. Better than stormtroopers. But I guess inaccurate stormtroopers is a staple of the Star Wars universe).<br><br>I don't get Finn. He says he was kidnapped as a child and trained to be a stormtrooper. But not once through the movie does he seem like an indoctrinated brainwashed fanatic. Yet his superiors say he showed no signs of being non-compliant or something. Then later when he leads Han and Chewie onto Starkiller Base he says he worked sanitation. Huh? They kidnapped a child to make him a janitor? I thought he was kidnapped to be a stormtrooper? <br><br>Another new character introduced in this film was a stormtrooper named Captain Phasma. First you have the cool name "Phasma" and then you add the silver armor and the cape and you have the potential makings of the next Boba Fett. And the promotions for the film made Phasma seem significant. Well she's not. That's right. SHE. I was totally caught off guard when I heard Phasma speak with a feminine voice. The fact Phasma is a woman wasn't the problem but the voice really didn't suit the character. I could even look past the voice if she did anything cool. But she was more of prop seen maybe 3 times in the movie. Her biggest contribution to the film was betraying the First Order which led to the destruction of Starkiller Base and possibly being thrown into a garbage compactor. Some badass... What a complete waste of a potentially awesome character. <br><br>Much like Darth Vader Kylo Ren served a master. His master is Supreme Leader (Kim Jong-) Snoke. He's only seen as a giant hologram throughout the movie. Andy Serkis plays him so of course he had to do it in motion capture. Since Snoke looks exact like a (Voldemort inspired) human with scars over his head and ear it seemed utterly pointless to make him CG. Is there a reason they couldn't slap some makeup on Serkis and just film him like they used to do before CGI? He did a great job of portraying Ulysses Klaw in Avengers: Age of Ultron and they didn't need motion capture on him then. <br><br>Now it's time to cover the 5 seconds that made it the worst Star Wars ever. There's really no way to soften the blow or casually slide it in so I'll just blurt it out as bluntly as possible: Han Solo dies. Yes that's right. His good for nothing punk kid stabs a lightsaber through his heart ending his existence. I have been impacted by fictional character deaths before but they've never felt anything quite like this one. I almost felt like a lightsaber ran through my heart too. Maybe mine wasn't stabbed but it was definitely broken. I kinda feel like I lived or believed a lie my whole life. For 32 years Han Solo was safe and alive after Return of the Jedi and I thought that would be the case forever. He had his happy ending. But I was wrong. Deceived if you will. I thought "Well maybe he survived." But he was stabbed through the heart fell off a bridge into what seemed like a bottomless pit and the planet exploded shortly after that. So I think it's safe to say Han's not coming back. Unless maybe the planet's core was made of carbonite...<br><br>I read that the writers said the film needed "guts" and to that extent I will give them credit. Killing off Han was definitely gutsy. Stupid but gutsy. Killing off Luke Leia Chewie R2 or C-3PO would not have had the same impact. It would be sad but not traumatic. Han was the glue of this movie. He is what made it feel like the old-fashioned Star Wars fun I grew up watching and loving. It's been 32 years since Harrison Ford played Han Solo but watching him reprise the role it seemed hardly a day had past. And just like that he will never strap on the holster again. <br><br>From a writer's perspective I appreciate that the writers wanted to shake things up. And as awful as it was to experience watching that scene if they were going to kill off Han at least they handled it pretty well. It was meaningful in the sense that it pushed Kylo further towards the Dark Side. And despite just being stabbed by his own flesh and blood Han lovingly held his son's cheek before falling into oblivion. But also from a writer's perspective you don't kill off your best character especially when there's no one to take up the mantle. Look what at George RR Martin did with his A Song of Ice and Fire series. He got so addicted to killing off his best characters he forgot to replace them (or wasn't able to) and the quality of the books suffered drastically. Rey Finn and Poe were fine but they don't come close to filling Han's role in the films. I doubt any of them were supposed to do that but I guarantee Episodes 8 and 9 will feel hollow like something is missing. Like its soul. <br><br>I've only seen the movie twice in theaters and it took me about a month before seeing it my second time. Part of the reason was I just didn't want to see that scene again. I invited my mom to see it but I also didn't want to see it with her because I didn't want to be there when she first saw him die. I thought it might be easier seeing his death the second time because I knew it was coming. But I was wrong. It was harder BECAUSE I knew it was coming. My heart was twisting the whole time he was on the bridge confronting his son. I even said in my head before he yelled out to Kylo "Don't do it Han. Don't go on that bridge." And just like it broke my heart it broke my mom's heart too. She was devastated by it. It's truly disappointing because she was just saying how much fun the movie was because of Han right before they entered Starkiller Base. I agreed with her but knew in the back of my mind the fun would be over soon. <br><br>So anyway that's one man's opinion of The Force Awakens. If you turn off your brain (and heart for 5 seconds) it's a pretty fun and entertaining movie. However it will destroy your soul., 4.0,  Tim F, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976978132/, January 7 2018, N/A

 This movie has it all -- if you are looking for a perfectly bad film despite what amounts to all the resources in the world: Mary Sue protagonist useless side-characters whose existence in the story seems forced (as if to fulfill some kind of Affirmative Action quota) never-ending plot holes unimaginative storylines a gross over-dependence on special effects a virtual copy/remake of the original Star Wars film absolute lack of real character progression for classic characters and a story-line that is weak utterly disappointing unsatisfying and absolutely DULL. Rey is a Mary Sue character. The character of Finn is pointless (except of course as the token good-guy Black man of this new trilogy) and the film performs acrobatic back flips to try to make him important relevant or cool (pick one they all fail miserably). Poe Dameron is almost equally over-hyped yet actually unimportant as Finn because the film could have easily done without him. The story line produces non-sensical inconsistencies with the classic main characters from the original trilogy AND THE PLOT HOLES NEVER END.

 I am so happy The Force Awakens reminded me more of the original Star Wars movies rather than the mediocre prequels. I loved the new characters. Loved seeing our old friends Han Luke Leia R2D2 C3PO and so on. Excellent special effects and a fantastic soundtrack. And the acting was top-notch. A great new chapter in the Star Wars universe.

 J.J Abrams tried Can you be done for plagiarism by your own company?<br><br>We had been waiting a long time for this moment and when Kevin Smith posted photos of him crying telling us how beautiful it all was my expectations went through the roof!<br><br><br>Sitting in the cinema on Boxing Day watching the Opening crawl Luke missing had me excited but the whole idea that basically the empire was still going 30 years after it had been defeated I screwed my face up a little at Really you couldn't have come up with another brute force to come in and try and take control.. oh well then it got into Poe talking with old mate i'm getting excited just about kicking my cousin who was sitting next to me.<br>And that scene with Kylo stopping the laser blast just about had jumping out of my seat and punching Him as i sat watching in amazement.<br> <br>The fighter pilot was awesome and the defector helping him escape I'm thinking to myself 'hey this is going to be a great buddy film get a bit of a bromance happening meanwhile - questions burning like who's Finns parents he doesn't know them maybe he's one of Lukes? Landos and Leias? didn't he have the lightsaber in the trailer??<br><br>And that's possibly where the good stuff ends sure seeing Han and Chewie get back on the Falcon pulled at the old heart strings hearing that great on liner.<br>but really we got a Rehash of episode 4 with a female Lead nothing wrong with that. but nothing right with making a rehash. <br>The whole movie is a carbon copy of Episode 4.<br>examples:<br>1. Rey rehashes what old Obi Wan does in the death star. on Star killer base climbing stuff running through corridors same camera angles and then using a Jedi mind trick on Stormtroopers.<br>Bad fan theory "is she Obi Wan's Granddaughter"<br>Hell no that guy was like a Catholic Priest.<br><br>2. An Old guy sacrifices himself for others.<br><br>3. Another Death Star.<br>4. A droid stumbling across our hero<br><br>5. Another desert planet with another whiny nobody.<br><br>6. One girl Two guys a droid and a Wookie.<br>The list goes on.<br><br>My Edits:<br><br>1. Remove the desert planet <br>2. Rey as a scavenger almost slave. rich girl lost her parents bit of a bitchy attitude gets better over course of the movie.<br>3. Han wouldn't ever have lost the falcon.<br>4. Han sticks around for Leia and does everything to get him back not hide.<br>5. Where's Lando?<br>6. Luke should have rocked up to fight Ren after Han is murdered that's kinda his thing sensing when his friends are in danger.<br>7. Not another death star<br>8. Seriously storm troopers? the army kept the same look for 50 years?? the helmets aren't that different! complete new design. <br>Final Word:<br>J.J Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan should have sat down and maybe not released this film until 2018 and came up with a bit better story line LISTENED to the master and used George Lucas's idea and edited the screenplay cause even George himself has said in the making of Star Wars movies he's not the most articulate with words but at least he has some good stories to tell.

 So I guess that all what have been accomplished by the rebellion during the original trilogy was worth nothing since it has been destroyed in two minutes by the Death Star 3.0. So disappointed I will just pretend that it takes place between ep 3 and 4 which is not to hard to imagine considering that all the ships and uniforms have remained exactly the same after 30 years, ni,  Pax A, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977051273/, January 13 2018, N/A
 The Force Awakens is about a scavenger (Daisy Ridley) and a renegade stormtrooper (John Boyega) and together they enlist the help of legendary smugglers Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca to transport a droid carrying information regarding the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker. Let me start off by saying that I am and always will be a huge Star Wars fan. The characters and the story has always intrigued me. The Force Awakens is a stunning sequel that arrays a perfect mix of new and old. This movie is everything that you hoped and dreamed that it would be. John Boyega and Daisy Ridley shine and have great chemistry together as well as Adam Driver perfectly portraying the sinister Kylo Ren. Don't be alarmed all of your favorite Star Wars characters are back as well. They aren't however just in the movie for nostalgic value. All of the classic characters we know and love still bring so much to the table plot wise and they still deliver key performances. When you put all of these actors and iconic characters under the direction of J.J Abrams you have what I believe to be the best Star Wars film in the saga. However the acting/direction isn't the only thing that we must give credit for. John Williams is still composing and his music score is just as powerful as it was when the first movie was released back in 1977. The music gives the movie so much feeling and the score blends perfectly with both the acting and the cinematography. I also must give props to Daniel Mindel who did a fantastic job on the cinematography. He made the movie seem so much more realistic and made it very exciting. Everything in this particular Star Wars movie just seemed bigger and better. Overall The Force Awakens lives up to the previous films making this a near perfect seventh installment., ni,  Nate H, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/972932118/, January 13 2018, N/A

 Badass movie! Makes Star Wars great again! I adore just about everything about this movie and considering it to be my personal favorite of the franchise so far. The Special effects are gorgeous and easily the best of series. They immersed me into the creative world of the film and made me feel like I was there unlike what any Star Wars movie has before. The Plot is similar to what you would expect from a Star Wars film but it's packed with many surprises along the way to keep the audience hooked. Han Solo is remarkable in this film and will break you heart. Finn is enduing and his partnership with Poe Dameron at the beginning of the film is electrifying. I just love that their bros right from the start. Kylo Ren is a fascinating villain and one of the best and most well developed in recent memory. The entire cast is phenomenal but it's Daisy Ridley as the unlikely heroine Rey that shines brightest of all for me. She is the heart and Soul of this film and the actress brings her to life with such potency and grace unlike almost any other character that I've seen before. I was in love with her from the moment we meet her on Jakku. Her interactions with Finn are Great especially the scene when the two fly the millennium falcon for the first time. BB8 is perhaps the best of all of the droid characters in Star Wars. This is a fast paced film with only small moments for the characters to breathe but that worked quite nicely in my opinion. This is an absolutely fantastic movie with Breaktaking visuals A brilliant score loveable characters relentless action and above all an accelerating story. It is a film that I will cherish for many years to come., 5.0,  Hanif M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/890612676/, January 11 2018, N/A
 I did not enjoy the film but I did not hate it. To me is seemed like a reboot and that was not neccesary. With the millions of different storylines avaliable for stars wars it did not need a " lets start over " format. I think Rey is ok but her powers are way out of check for no apprarent reason. Snoke and some of the other characters are difficult to be interested in. Fin I think it is kind of sad his only purpose seem to be for comedic relief. Han solos ex ...girlfriend....?? now that is a stupid character... Parts of the movie were a little dull. I give 2 stars for seeing the band back togther and the visuals and the music score., 2.0,  Carter R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977031684/, January 11 2018, N/A
 A film proven hollow as everything set up within it - the 100 unanswered questions - were just that - empty mystery boxes that receive no satisfactory payoff whatsoever in the subsequent follow-up The Last Jedi. The Force Awakens is a case study in why mystery box filmmaking is cavalier and dangerous if other writers and directors are given the job of the sequels without mandates to align with the previous chapter. Any meaning Force Awakens might have had we will never know. To paraphrase Harrison Ford The Force Awakens is now "just another useless experience.", 0.5,  Michael F, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977045051/, January 11 2018, N/A
 After making this movie JJ Abrams has cemented himself as the biggest troll in history. I waited decades to see Han Luke and Leia get the band back together and not only did JJ Abrams not deliver he ensured that no one can. Aside from that huge disappointment the movie felt like a highlight reel of the original trilogy.<br> <br>It was entirely too derivative and failed miserably at delivering new characters that we are supposed to care about. Finn and Rey have "unknown" backgrounds and the only thing we know about Poe is that he is a great pilot and... um... well he's also a great pilot. Even worse Rey is both a Mary Sue character and one that doesn't develop. She actually chooses not to be a hero and only appears at the end of the movie because she was forced to be there against her will. Han Solo had a change of heart in A New Hope. He grows as a character. Rey doesn't.<br><br>Not only is this is my least favorite movie in the franchise it's the only one I actually dislike (so far)., 0.5,  Jason R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976960333/, January 11 2018, N/A
 "The Force Awakens" contains the expected pure storytelling and top-notch action sequences from director J.J.

 Good action film but misses the task. Instead of showing the evolution of the Star Wars universe since the death of the emperor it is an incomplete parodical shitty irrational rip-off/reboot of episode 4 (it seems to me that reboots are Abrams speciality?). And now after TLJ we wont get much answers to the newer questions either. <br>Episode 7 broke my heart 8 further disappointed me and the Star Wars Battlefront games are a disgrace.

 I found this movie to be OK. It's better than the prequels but it's mostly a remix of A New Hope. The action is well choreographed and the effects are well done. Abrams introduces his 'mystery boxes' into the stew and I have some fear that this will be a long chase to an empty idea in the sequels. The bigger badder First Order are not well fleshed out and the Resistance's plight is also devoid of a real backstory. All of the original cast are presented as failures. Han and Leia are divorced/separated with a spoiled emo jerk of a son. Luke who we only see for a moment has failed as a teacher. The fact that out heroes are now old and sour is disappointing but our modern age loves to deflate our expectations with divorce and moral failure., 2.0,  fantom b, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976976933/, January 10 2018, N/A

 Close enough to Star Wars to feel like a Remake but also fun enough to make the audience not care. The Force Awakens feels like a Star Wars movie to me. After nearly 40 years there are certain things fans expect from a Star Wars movie and The Force Awakens delivers them all with panache. The new stars acquit themselves well while Han and Chewie retaking the Falcon gets this guy's nostalgia tears running. All the callbacks to the OT are intentional. TFA is not supposed to be the saviour of Sci-Fi filmmaking... it's only a vessel to take us back to our childhoood and The Force Awakens has done that for me., 4.0,  Kevin G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/897152146/, January 5 2018, N/A
 In keeping with George Lucas there is no Episode VII. And if there were a follow up to Return of the Jedi this would not be the movie to carry on the torch of the Star Wars saga. For all their flaws this film's chronological and production predecessors were able to conclude and tie up the saga's story in overall satisfying ways.<br><br>This film plays more like a greatest hit compilation of the original trilogy. The plot is nearly a carbon copy of the original film's. Incase you've forgotten it's about the Empire's attempts to find a droid with the Death Star plans. This one is about the First Order's attempts to find a droid with a map to Luke Skywalker. Oh and the Death Star has been replaced with a bigger and badderer planet sized weapon known as Starkiller Base. However it lacks the flow of that film. Each scene seemed to flow naturally and the story kept expanding on itself.<br><br>The writing is overall lazy and betrays the characters that have been established for almost 40 years. Han has reverted back to being a smuggler for some reason. Luke has gone missing which Mark Hamill said Luke wouldn't turn his back on his friends. Rey is a "Mary Sue" who can do no wrong. Finn is a missed opportunity of a stormtrooper who has turned his back on the First Order. It would have been interesting to see him as kind of a fish out of water. Kylo Ren is emo crybaby he's the son of Han and Leia who unlike Anakin hasn't suffered from any real loss or tragedy he's just a little punk. <br><br>One of the worst tragedies of this film is that there is a gap of 30+ years between the two movies. Many complained of the prequels overly political subject matter. However in 30 years Leia wasn't able to shore up support to create a new government to prevent the rise of the First Order. I mean seriously what happened in that time? Did star systems who suffered under the Empire ask for reparations? Did the Republic just print money to deal with the problem? Was there a power vacuum after the Empire fell? How long did it take to defeat the Empire? How did the First Order rise? Who is Snoke? How did Kylo Ren get bested by a girl who knew little of the force? Instead of smuggling why didn't Han just get into government contracting? He could have formed a private military company. How did that troll end up with Luke's lightsaber? The journey of his lightsaber through the cold unforgiving vacuum of space would probably be a better story that this movie. Would be cool seeing his severed hand and weapon floating through space. And then go from owner to owner before the troll got it. Overall a completely missed opportunity.<br><br>Final verdict watch once and move along this isn't the Star Wars movie you're looking for...., 1.5,  Keith H, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/849902942/, January 5 2018, N/A

 Derivative and containing some really stupid scenes and bad empty characters. The force awakens works because it is a casting off of the shadow of the prequels and and introduction to the new heroes.<br><br>In the desire to recreate the original rebels vs empire themes the writers basically decided to ignore much of what has come before and create a macguffin reset button so they can rehash it all again. <br><br>Its as if disney interpretation of peoples love for star wars original trilogy is to just go over the same ground again so it's rather disappointing and way to 'safe' in many respects.<br><br>Other than Rey the new characters are shallow and pointless. Kylo ren started interesting and turned into a whiny child by the end. Hux is way to young and has no presence at all he's no Peter crushing / tarkin that's for sure.. <br><br>Whole sections of the movie could have been cut and the end results would have flowed better (introduce Han on jaku remove the wacky freighter full of cg octopus aliens is a good example)<br><br>For all this it has its moments and the effects are ace the return to physical special effects is especially welcome. Jakku is beautiful and there are some nice ideas ( like kylos reverence for vader) which show promise and I hope are explored further. <br><br> It's junk food in the end.... enjoyable but low in substance.

 Ridiculous plot only the thinnest veneer of a wink towards Star Wars history ignoring everything in the previous movies except a rehash of a few characters. The movie is nothing more than a poorly written vehicle to promote new and less interesting characters. Finn the token black guy is introduced as a combat experienced stormtrooper than quickly turned into a bumbling coward. Rey is a flat-out no-holds-barred Mary Sue of no redeeming qualities and absolutely boring to watch. Luke Skywalker's character development required 3 movies to get to where he was able to "barely" defeat Darth Vader his own father. It wasn't until the 3rd movie that Luke could influence minds well enough to manipulate the weak minded. Rey achieved the same level - without any training at all - in the very first she's introduced. That's a Mary Sue. In The Last Jedi in a stick fight she beats the crap out of Luke - who is a Jedi Master - and can move huge rocks and demonstrate very high skill with a light sabre without absolutely minimal training and no actual character development.

 It's not often we even get seventh part in a movie franchise never mind it being out of this world It has to be the best film in 2015 A very simple plot so simple and easy to follow that you probably wouldn't need to watch the first 6 to understand Some great effects as we expect now days The 3D was ok but not needed but it was better used during the battles in space but apart from that it's nothing great It was full of gripping action that's some of the best in the series so far It was nice to see most of the original cast back in action and it feels like they have never been away If you're a big Star Wars fan like me this film will put a huge grin on your face as soon as we see A long time in a galaxy far far away We will laugh at the nice humour added We will be in shock at a few scenes which may upset some fans too and to be honest I could of cried in one scene With all the hype and all the box office records it's broke it had to live up to it and it sure did It's a movie that cannot be missed and really sets the bar high for future films in the series., 5.0, , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/788614323/, December 30 2017, Super-reviewer

 A New Hope: Redux<br><br>JJ Abrams didnt take too many risks when making this film and it shows.<br><br>Admittedly there was no way this film was going to please everyone but surely fans of the OT should have been on their 'hit' list?<br><br>This film carefully retreads the plot of the ANH (and arguably TPM) diverting from it's course just long enough re-introduce the old cast and to aggressively shoe horn in a few nods to the OT before continuing on with its uninspiring plot.<br><br>Some of the new characters have immediate depth and are worthy additions to the canon and the aesthetics of the SW universe has been faithfully recreated.<br><br>Daidy Ridley has the opportunity to be an excellent lead but her character was let down by being made into a textbook example of a Mary Sue seemingly a master pilot (of the Millennium Falcon no less) Engineer Force user and lightsaber duelist within hours of meeting the rest of the cast.<br><br>While the film was really quite heavy handed with the anaolgies to Nazism the First Order are a fitting replacement for the Empire and Adam Driver's Kylo Ren a dark and troubled replacement for Vader.<br><br>Similar to Rogue One and perhaps inspiring it this film took every oportunity to 'elbow you in the ribs' with a nod or tongue-in-cheek reference to the OT to the point that it became an ongoing irritation (although Rogue One was far worse in this respect).<br><br>I lef the cinema feeling let down and cancelled my pre-order although I did give in and buy the film a month or so after its release as I felt it deserved a second chance... <br><br>I did enjoy the lightsaber duel in the woods though... best one yet!, 2.0,  H R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977013570/, December 29 2017, N/A

 This sequel of the original trilogy failed to be a movie that stands on it's own. <br>While the fast pacing editing of JarJar Abrams devoid the story of any explanation the story itself it a shameless remake of Ep4 A new Hope.: not a good start for a supposed new trilogy. <br>Long but at the same time extremely rushed specially in the final segment against ANOTHER DEATH STAR (if it's a joke is not funny)<br>The new characters lacks in gravitas: Rey characters failed to appeal due to HER innatural talents in everything the plot needs her to do. <br>No introduction required. No training needed to handle the force or to fight an armed force trained opponent. A mary sue if you will. Too good to be likable.<br>kinda like Poe but at least he failed at something.<br>FInn character felt illogicall in it's own action but at least had a story arc. A really bad one but it had one.<br>The tired rehearsal of the struggle between the Empire (First Order) and Resistance (Rebel) felt pointless and out of nowhere. the film behave like the Original Trilogy never happened and suffer from the absess of any kind of worldbuilding..<br>Where is the rest of the galaxy? <br>Where is the new republic? <br>The former empire? <br>Not a brilliant movie.

 This is a strange film in that it makes for reasonably fun (albeit hollow) viewing when you watch it for the first time but becomes progressively worse the more you think about it. As a soft reboot of A New Hope the story's completely derivative - but that's the idea. It recaptures the aesthetic of the original version nicely it's visually impressive and the action is engaging. The acting is mostly good. Unfortunately there are plot holes galore and the characters (especially the central duo of Rey and Finn) are too shallow and underdeveloped to be interesting. They lack comprehensible motives so their actions are nonsensical. The story lurches from one set-piece to another without any real narrative thread. The Force Awakens ends up being less of a movie than a spastic dumbed-down remix of the greatest hits of the original trilogy. And speaking of the original trilogy the fates of those movies' iconic heroes will leave a lingering bad taste., 2.0,  Jon S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976151900/, December 29 2017, N/A
 "Disney copied-and-pasted the plot of A New Hope and assigned each characters lines and actions to "new" acceptable 2015 faces.

Phenomenal visuals good soundtrack and interesting characters for the most part. I did not like some of the humour ( especially between Fin and Rey).

 An amazing movie. Though very similar to ANH I know it was intentional to pay homage to the original film. <br><br>A few fan service moments here and there a bit too much in your face. But the film has very strong characters and is very fun also an a amazing soundtrack.<br><br>Han's death was very well done I feel. You wanted to love the heroes and hate the villains all the more so. Very impactful. <br><br>I felt that having a 3rd Deathstar (Starkiller) was where the similarities to ANH went a bit "too far" and was not necessary. Also I was rather dissapointed as a fan in going back to the whole "rebels (Resistance) vs Empire (First Order) story. I wanted to see the New Republic in it's prime after ROTJ not some some strange 3 way relationship between the NR Rebels 2.0 and First Order that can only be understood by reading books and comics not good when a movie does that. <br><br>But overall fantastic film! It left open some great mysteries about new characters moments that implied that Han and Leia knew who she was as well as Kylo. As well as some mystery of why she is so powerful. I myself am not a fan who complains she is a Mary Sue but understands there is something "more" to her than meets the eye., 4.0,  Matthew T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/972679940/, December 27 2017, N/A

 Wow! When I first saw this movie it was opening night December 2015 I fell asleep and woke up at the end missed the whole movie. Then I saw Rogue One and thought it was the Force Awakens and while I was watching the Last Jedi was really confused until a google &amp wikipedia search cleared up some chronological confusion. The Force Awakens was an awesome movie after seeing the Last Jedi earlier this week and believing it to be one of the better films I now understand why people are so critical of it. The Force Awakens sure set the bar kind of high with a great cliff hanger conclusion to a 40+ year legacy. There was a lot of great themes and metaphors throughout the film the action sequences were very intricate and the imagination of director JJ Abrhams was superb. Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher did an excellent job transitioning from the young adults in the original films to the veterans of the modern Star Wars/Disney era. The music was really good. Great score! Thought the Last Jedi did a better job with the scenary but the Force Awakens is the better film because of the action and CGI stuff. The aerial attack sequences were exhilarating. When I was suprised to learn the Force Awakens doubled opening weekend box office versus the Last Jedi now makes much more sense. Would recommend this to any long time star wars fan/ and or first timer. Only gave it 4.5 because I reserve the 5 star for something more original.

 The first time I've ever seen a Star Wars movie was in 2015 with EpisodeVII after watching it. I FELL IN LOVE with the franchise because it showed not only a great sense of humour but outstanding action sequences and terrific characterisation from the original-trilogy-cast and the new-trilogy-cast. It proved that despite beeing bought by Disney it still had so many things doubts and sequels to show. The Force Awakens was the best Science-fiction movie of 2015 and the best one I'd seen.

 Ok let's get this out of the way first: The new Star Wars movie does live up to the original trilogy. Besides that though it also modernizes the franchise while also being a hoot of an adventure movie for both newcomers and longtime fans. While the inclusion of familiar faces is sure to invigorate the audience the best moments come from the new characters. Finn Rey and Kylo Ren are all well-cast and instantly likable and hopefully their back stories will be even more fleshed out in the sequels. Also The Force Awakens is carried by a really tight script and just like this year's Mad Max: Fury Road it's jam-packed with action but still tells a story efficiently. Some emotional moments are a bit glossed over and some story elements seem a bit too similar to the original Star Wars but it's free of the annoying and childish tone that doomed the Star Wars prequels. Finally Star Wars fans can sleep tight: Their signature series is back and with a brighter future than ever., 4.5,  Peter F, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/782851126/, December 25 2017, N/A

 In the wake of The Last Jedi and seeing all the justifiably negative reviews for it including my own I'm surprised there are so many positive reviews for The Force Awakens. While Rian Johnson veers the SW canon into a ditch and lights it on fire Force Awakens is an overly safe wooden and hollow remake of A New Hope in most respects. JJ Abrams is the ultimate hack director bringing nothing new or interesting to the table and relying on audience pleasing cliches after cliches and poor writing. And while The Last Jedi may have messed with the SW universe to the point of no return The Force Awakens does it's own dance on the SW universe's grave by making the Force something that is simply inherited with no explanation of why training was even needed in the OT.<br><br>There were also a number of unexplained moments and plot holes in Force Awakens that gets a pass from many while the Last Jedi gets rightly criticized for. I don't want to delegitimize other reviews but I do wonder how much the enormous hype leading up to A Force Awakens effected reviews. <br><br>Apart from the above issues The Force Awakens itself looks surprisingly generic and rushed. The one positive for The Last Jedi is it does have some truly amazing visuals. <br><br>I believe neither one of these films will be remembered all too fondly down the road as Disney has completely missed the mark on what makes Star Wars so loved by so many.

 When this movie was first announced I was so excited to get to visit this galaxy again. I loved these characters that I grew up with. It was sadly disappointing that the original best friends had gone their separate ways and that was a turn off. I could not see that happening with Luke Han and Leia. I had looked up every bit of news on this movie as it trickled out and felt underwhelmed when I finally saw it. I did not like the direction that this movie was taking and was so surprised that JJ Abrams didn't deliver. I maintained some false hope that the next movie would be better but it was equally bad. So in the end I wanted to come back and leave a review that this movie was the beginning of the end of my favorite movie series. JJ set the story line in a place in which it only went downhill. I think he has equal blame to how bad the new SW movies are., 1.5,  Iva M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/843860508/, January 2 2018, N/A

 I'm happy to say that "The Force Awakens" triumphantly succeeds at making the unnecessary necessary by continuing the Star Wars story from its 1983 conclusion with characters both new and old and the same fairy tale plotline we have all come to love expect and appreciate from the franchise since its inception. <br>It is a tad disappointing that Episode VII borrows heavily from Episode IV in terms of its story delivery but honestly there was probably no other way to have been able to get the franchise up and going again with the same attention to care and detail as the previous films specifically the first three made between 1977-1983., 4.5,  Grant W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/975734541/, January 1 2018, N/A

 When Disney first announced they were purchasing Lucasfilm back in 2012 and going to be making new Star Wars films it was hard not to be excited. We had thought the series was done with the big screen after George Lucas' Episodes I-VI (and an ill-planned movie spinoff of the great The Clone Wars series). However despite all of this excitement it was hard not to be at least a little worried about how it could turn out. The Force Awakens went a long way in reassuring us that Star Wars would be okay in new hands. Though it does follow some familiar plot points that were present in A New Hope (a reason I'll never understand why some don't like the film) it injects much needed new life into the saga with new faces and threats. J. J. Abrams and Lucasfilm could have easily played it safe and played on nostalgia by merely showing what our heroes from the original trilogy were up to thirty years later. However Han Leia and Luke are not the main focus of this story and that's a great thing. These characters are still integral but the Star Wars universe existed a long time before they came around and will continue on after them as shown by the great new characters of Rey Finn Poe and Kylo. Though the performances of "legacy" actors like Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher are great newcomers Daisy Ridley John Boyega Oscar Isaac and Adam Driver truly shine. The cast outside of them is great too - there isn't a weak link here. Overall there isn't much I dislike about this movie and it's grown on me more and more with every viewing. The direction story effects are all so good to me. Does it reach the heights of A New Hope or The Empire Strikes Back? Not quite. The scene with the rathtars was kind of jarring and I could've done without it in that form. However I think its fast cohesive pace places it ahead of Return of the Jedi for me (sacrilege I know). Overall The Force Awakens does an excellent job of jumpstarting this sequel trilogy that few thought we would ever get. It was a great "welcome home" to Star Wars on the big screen., 4.5,  Griff C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976670260/, December 23 2017, N/A

 Watching this movie felt like coming home. My cheeks hurt so much by then end from smiling the whole way through (well except for when I audibly gasped or cried). As someone who grew up on Star Wars I couldn't imagine a better way to reboot this classic film series. Yes this retcons the canon given in the post-Episode VI books but I felt it had to to give us a real shot at new Star Wars films exiting with old characters. The brightest spots of this film weren't the return of old favorites like Han and Leia but the new cast of characters created especially for this reboot. Finn Rey and Poe are fantastically believable and full of potential for future films. The runaway stormtrooper former slave from a desert planet and hotshot resistance pilot all add depth and emotion to a fantastic sci-fi experience.<br><br>As a Star Wars film it goes without saying that the action sequences are stunning and you'll have a great time seeing this film.

 I loved this movie. JJ Abrams did a great job introducing new characters and made me feel connected to these new characters while still using the iconic characters from the past.

 Not only a terrible Star Wars movie it's an utterly horrible movie in general. The problem with this new series is that the focus is appeasing the PC culture crowd - 'diversity' and 'inclusiveness' was the main goal. Not a story that draws people in. And no it's not a problem at all that Force Awakens takes too much from A New Hope - history repeats itself. The problem is the lack of logic involved in where this new series is going.. How the crap did the First Order a shell of its former self Empire put together a weapon far greater than the Empire could at its peak?? When last we saw our heroes they were celebrating victory over the Empire.. Now Luke is a hermit Han is a deadbeat and Leia is a broken woman? This movie was not made by people who love the franchise. This was made by people trying to push a Social Justice Warrior/PC culture narrative. The characters are awful the story is awful and I will not be seeing the next two movies. It's over. Star Wars is ruined.

 C/C+<br>72.5/100<br><br>I was underwhelmed the first time I saw the Force Awakens and still kind of am. There are things I like about it. There are things I don't like about it. Let's get into it.<br><br>STORY: Right off the bat it's A New Hope mixed with V and elements of VI. Disney did this to remind fans of how good Star Wars is and also not to the set the bar too high for the next one. And honestly in retrospect it paid off. The Last Jedi made a lot of risky moves and so does The Force Awakens. But it's a glaring issue for the MOVIE ITSELF. It's almost so similar that it takes me out of the movie and makes me think that it doesn't belong in the series--because the story doesn't feel like a natural progression-- because it feels like reboot. But there are elements I enjoy--the idea of Luke in hiding passed into legend trained the main villain and messed up rebuilding the Jedi and they must find him Han as a mentor of sorts a conflicted Sith/Vader poser struggling with emotion a storm trooper turned Resistance fighter... It's all very exciting. But they're only new pieces in an old puzzle. 2/4<br><br>SCRIPT: There's a lot of problems and script conveniences for sure and again it follows the same beats as A New Hope. Some of the dialog is good some of it is not so good. There are moments that felt thrown in to please modern movie fans and Marvel fans moments thrown in to please Star Wars fans moments thrown in to save time and moments thrown in for no reason at all. There are a lot of missed opportunities in this movie But there are also times when The Force Awakens is just kind of a compelling rich fun and crowd pleasing sci-fi adventure movie. But only some of it lives up to the franchise's legacy. It also doesn't explain the backstory of the First Order the Resistance where the Republic/Empire is at who Snoke Rey and Max Von Sydow's character are...It feels like you're watching the second movie of a trilogy which explains how much of a finality the Last Jedi had... 2/4<br><br>CHARACTERS: Some of the characters are new and different except for Rey/Luke Maz/Yoda BB-8/R2-D2 and Han filling the Ben Kenobi role. Kylo Ren is a wannabe Vader but I'm fine with that because that's SUPPOSED to be part of his character. It's what makes him torn and they go somewhere with it in VIII. Finn is a good character we haven't seen before--a storm trooper who joins the good side. Other than that the characters aren't all that interesting. 2/4<br><br>DIRECTION: JJ loves Star Wars clearly. But he's a blind fan. He doesn't understand it. This movie is a conglomeration of the original trilogy. If only he was a more creative storyteller this would have been much different and better. But given the job he had and the expectations he had to live up to from both fans AND Disney executives he did a nice job making a dump fun space movie. 3/4<br><br>PERFORMANCES: Pretty much everyone is good in it except for Rey and Maz and a few over the top moments. 3/4<br><br>CINEMATOGRAPHY: It's good looking for sure wonderfully shot great sets and locations colorful just almost feels and looks like Star Wars. 4/4<br><br>EDITING: As similar to IV as it is the pacing is great. There are some things I would have removed or replaced with explanations about the Republic and WTH is going on politically but I think it's well-edited for the most part. 4/4<br><br>SOUND DESIGN: Perfect. 4/4<br><br>MUSIC: Not my favorite score in the series. It felt lacking not enough diversity very repetitive and not Star Warsy at all except for some new themes and returning themes. 2/4<br><br>ACTION / SPECIAL EFFECTS: The action is good except for the trench run/space battle which felt "been there done that." The special effects are great but often get in the way. Maz looks weird but there were so many cool puppets and designs. The CGI was also pretty neat. 3/4<br><br>Total points:<br>29/40<br>72.5/100<br>C/C+<br><br>All in all this seventh movie in a franchise could have been so much more with missed opportunities abound. But on its own for people who don't give a crap about Star Wars it's a fun space adventure film with colorful effects and entertaining action and some heart made by giddy and devoted fans of the venerable franchise., 3.5,  Movie R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976845912/, December 22 2017, N/A

 An utterly forgettable movie. Han's death had less emotional impact than watching Obi Wan die in the first movie and he was killed by his own son not a former pupil. The jokes seemed hackneyed and the humor forgettable. Rei came off as a Mary Sue everything seemed too easy for her and it brought my head up every time. She progressed in the use of the force so quickly even when compared to Anakin's abilities in the prequals she progressed in her abilities at LIGHT SPEED compared to Anakin or Luke and was using the force to compel people so fast it just didn't mesh well with the Star Wars Universe established by the previous movies.<br><br>Kylo Ren: The character was interesting but not so scary in this context he came off like the kid who would shoot up your school--which is terrifying in real life but not so much in a sci-fantasy movie with 7' tall furry aliens and self-aware robots. The Kylo character came off as an emo and whiny with a lack of self control--again an interesting take (and the only reason I'm not giving this movie the half star it would otherwise get).<br><br>Rei was essentially a Lego block with force powers and fighting skills. She wasn't that interesting of a character. Interesting characters have flaws and develop emotionally over a story. I got non of that from Rei. She was instantly good at anything she did from flying the MF to fighting with a light saber. Even in the prequals Anakin's ability to fly a ship was laid with the groundwork of pod racing--Rei had none of that. The result was that whenever she came to a dangerous situation there was no tension because she would spontaneously develop some sort of new ability to get herself out of trouble or a deus ex machine would appear (I.E. Po Dameron would show up) and save the day. The movie felt like a poorly-stitched-together-quilt of big ideas and not enough character development. Lots of flash and not-too-memorable fight scenes awkward humor and a cardboard-cut-out mary-sue heroine., 1.5,  Dani B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976990995/, December 24 2017, N/A

 The Force Awakens for me is a challenging review. The movie is entertaining and even bordering on enthralling at times. There are plenty of gripping space dogfights and it definitely feels like a Star Wars movie. Nonetheless it is not the most original of movies. It feels like a greatest hits compilation of things we loved about the original trilogy. It tweaks established character arcs ever so slightly (e.g. Luke's hero journey) and hands them off to fresh faces (such as Rey). I left the theatre (when I originally saw this movie) feeling quite elated at what I had just experienced. Flash-forward a few months later when I get it on DVD and the movie didn't really feel all that. I think at the time of The Force Awakens' release people were just beyond excited to be part of another Star Wars movie going experience. Of course when you have been dying (for what seems like forever) to see Luke Leia and Han again on the big screen it is all too easy to look past the movie's shortcomings. Upon watching it again at home while I already knew it was little more than a compilation of previous Star Wars "highs" the movie's actual flaws became more apparent. Captain Phasma seems like a merchandising ploy rather than a serious character (hence the "cool" armor. Star Wars "purists" are all too quick to dismiss Jar Jar Binks and the Ewoks. I realize that Captain Phasma isn't exactly "goofy" like they are but come on. Her role could have been relegated to someone else.). Why does Finn all of a sudden want to fight for the "good guys" (or at least not fight for the First Order)? Who is Snoke and why should we the audience care about him (beyond him being the Supreme Leader and Kylo Ren's master)? And what is up with Rey seeming to be all-powerful with a wide variety of skills? There are of course plenty of other examples and all of this goes to show that the movie rather defies logic and replaces necessary character development and exposition (every "good" movie has some!) with slam-bang action. I love action but I care more about character development the movie did not successfully convince me as to why these new characters are important. While certainly entertaining and constructed with a loving heart (courtesy of JJ Abrams) I cannot recommend a movie that recycles the past to a fault and has weak character development., 2.5,  Jon G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976985251/, December 23 2017, N/A

 The Force Awakens has been touted as one of the best films in the Star Wars saga. Why? Because it's not the prequels. Unfortunately it's just not that simple.<br><br>When it comes down to it The Force Awakens is a complete rehash of Episode IV: A New Hope. A rebel gives something to a droid who travels across a desert planet and finds a Force-sensitive person. The person meets an old veteran of a previous war and they travel to the rebel base. They then destroy a planet-killing super weapon. The problem is this time the plot is held together by coincidences instead of purpose. <br><br>The Force Awakens is well acted with Harrison Ford as Han Solo being the standout. The main character Rey who has unimaginable power and is able to do anything throughout the entire film is not really interesting so former stormtrooper Finn and brash angsty Kylo are left to pick up the slack.<br><br>Despite its flaws Episode VII is an entertaining film -- it's just not necessarily one with a lot of depth. The visual effects are great and the soundtrack is well...John Williams. Do I really need to say more? The problem with this film is J.J. Abrams played it much too safe and laid a poor foundation for The Last Jedi.<br><br>Overall The Force Awakens is a fun film that suffers from a lack of originality and a retread of old material that relies a little too much on nostalgia., 3.0,  Dillon J, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976972737/, December 23 2017, N/A

 A lot has been made of the derivative nature of The Force Awakens and the point is to a large extent valid. However I se it as a soft reboot meant to bring the franchise back to what made it great in the original trilogy.

 I don't dislike hate fear or respect Kylo Ren and he's the villain.. he's meant to a bad guy this boy is no Darth Vadar Darth maul Count dooku Darth revan Darth malgus etc etc he's just.. meh such piss poor writing disappointing.<br><br>Finn Rey and Poe the biggest issue I have is the introduction had promise but over all was weak the film never got me invested in these characters they didn't hook me they're just bland with terrible lines awkward acting and reactions which to be fair could be more down to the director than the actors themselves but Rey just seems like Emilia Clarke and Kristen Stewart slammed together to make an excitable bland shell of piss poor writing.<br><br>The plot was just a rehash of the previous films which I could forgive if the writing was better and if the characters had more well character. The film would have been 100x better if we got to know the characters more bloody hell give us something to invest in something to care about without that I can't feel the danger struggles tension or suspense. The only character that had life and personality was Han Solo which was mostly down to a veteran actor and a character which was already established by George Lucas's brilliance and then they killed him which sure that's how Hans story ends but the scene was written so poorly for his character the camera angles were dreadful and his "son" was just so horrendously written the whole thing ended up being bizarre.<br><br>Me and my friends left the cinema in shock and by the end of the night discussing what we just witnessed were just gutted.

 I liked this movie a lot when it first came out. I feel like they did a great job setting up the new characters while integrating in with some of the originals. I was a little upset about how they baited us with Luke but figured that they would make up for it in the Last Jedi. Wow was I wrong. They tried to ruin Luke to bring up the new characters. Absolute disaster. In the Last Jedi the character development with the new characters went sideways for the most part. Other than Kylo I guess. On the upside The Force Awakens seems much better now after seeing the Last Jedi.

 When it came out I was in shock. I had to do a lot of mental gymnastics in order to be okay with this film. Now that Last Jedi is out I really can't overlook the glaring flaws in this one.

 This movie was terrible TFA was a remake of A New Hope not Episode 7 of star wars. Not to mention that Rey was a Mary Sue some say read the tie in comics or books but it's been 10 years since the last star wars movie so we were expecting something and asking our self questions about these new characters and how will they go but in the end instead of asking our self questions we started asking JJ Abrams about all of these plot holes. Not to mention they killed off our favorite smuggler early! Yes I like Han and yes I knew Harrison Ford hated Han after episode V but they should of kept him in for another film. But the effects were good.... but this was a JJ abrams film not a star wars film now Disney is letting this fool back to direct Episode 9 if one film in the trilogy sucks then the future films will suck.

 What I was planning to do right before I watched Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens was to have an open mind. I was trying my best to avoid reading any reviews hoping that the film surprises me and what I can tell you honestly is that it certainly does.<br><br>I think one of the greatest things about Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens if not the best thing about it is seeing all these old faces in the big screen. Whenever there was a time that we see Luke Han Solo Leia and all the other memorable characters in the Star Wars series I was acting like the audiences clapping my hands at that point.<br><br>Most of the greatest stuff comes from J.J. Abrams. What he does best and it's like the same thing that he did with Star Trek is characterization. I think his development both to the plot and the characters in this film is nicely done. I certainly find these new characters very enjoyable and very appealing to watch. And even the performances John Boyega (Attack the Block) and newcomer Daisy Ridley are remarkably good. <br><br>However there are some issues I have with the film. The film relies a little too much on the Star Wars series bringing back familiar elements to A New Hope The Empire Strikes Back Return of the Jedi and especially Revenge of the Sith. And I don't find the film's last moments to be as thought-provoking as I'd like it to be.<br><br>Well despite all of my issues I think Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens is wonderfully done. Seeing old faces to the big screen new characters that are fun to watch a laughable humor and J.J. Abrams developing the story pretty well that's all it matters and that's why I really liked it. 8.7/10., 4.5,  Brandon M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/965772601/, December 21 2017, N/A
 After so many years of waiting to see old characters in new adventures alongside new characters The Force Awakens does not disappoint. The film might feel a bit light and fan-servicey and the story is a reboot of A New Hope but it's all handled so well I don't really care. There's adventure new mysteries a budding threat in the form of the First Order and enough nostalgia to satisfy., 4.0,  Mark F, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/969702761/, December 21 2017, N/A
 A totally uninspired remake of A New Hope that's what this fim is. Disney should have just made a movie out of the New Jedi order books or the Thrawn trilogy instead we get this. Hollywood it seems is really running out of ideas and a reboot/remake and that is essentially what this movie is is the best they could come up with. The plot makes no sense at all. Where is the New Republich in all this? How could the First Order become so powerful? Where did they get the resources to build this huge new death star (yeah innovative right?)? Luke abandons his friends just like that? How come Rey has these insane powers and beats a trained dark Jedi? NONE OF IT MAKES SENSE! If you want to know what happens after Episode 6 read the Thrawn Trilogy aka "Heirs to the Empire" from Timothy Zahn. I don't care if Disney declared it non Canon in my world this remains the true episodes 7-9., 0.5,  Sebastian T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976975629/, December 21 2017, N/A
 A glorious reunion with old friends and new ones. Bravo J.J. Abrams! You've successfully resurrected the Star Wars franchise with some much-needed energy and former glory. Believe the hype The Force Awakens is spectacular! <br><br>It's the movie event of the year and the wait is finally over! The Force Awakens is finally here and believe the hype this is the best Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back. The true praise and glorious applause all goes to the man in the director's chair J.J. Abrams (Star Trek and Star Trek Into Darkness). Sweeping the franchise out of a black hole from George Lucas' paralyzing Star Wars prequels.<br><br>So the saga continues 30 years after Return of the Jedi with a fantastic reunion of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) Han Solo (Harrison Ford) Chewbacca C3Po and R2D2. Abrams even introduces us to new characters: Rey (Daisy Ridley) Finn (John Boyega) Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) BB-8 (a witty new droid) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). So if you thought that the Galactic Empire was defeated in Return of the Jedi with Ewoks dancing on Stormtrooper's then think again.<br><br>Abrams and co-writers Michael Arndt (Little Miss Sunshine) and Lawrence Kasdan (he co-wrote The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi) bring forth a new force of evil called the First Order led by a young villainous Kylo Ren. Ren is continuing what Darth Vader started and has built a new Death Star that makes the old one look like a pipsqueak. Ren also reports to the new Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis by motion capture) who will be even more exciting in the future films to come.<br><br>On to the good side of the story it's been three decades after the defeat of the Galactic Empire and only a rag-tag group of heroes can stop the First Order along with the help of the Resistance. Rey is a desert scavenger abandoned by her family on Jukku while Finn is a Stormtrooper with little taste for killing and goes rouge. Poe is a pilot working for Leia a princess turned general who now leads the Resistance. Together is group of heroes kick ass and will send fanboys cheering in their seats.<br><br>Ridley is a woman with heart and mind this is her show as she steals multiple scenes throughout. Ford Hamill and Fisher's presence have never felt so surreal. Bravo for Ford who sends Solo soaring sky high throughout the film. He's never been better! Along with his faithful friend Chewbacca as they also team up with Rey and Finn on the good ol' Millennium Falcon that hunk of junk is still flying.<br><br>?As Leia's scenes show heartache and struggle The Force Awakens sends an emotionally charged message throughout. It will probably be one of the biggest movies of all-time and it has every right to-do so. Spoilers are a burden so I won't say anymore just that as a fan and film lover you won't be disappointed this Christmas. It receives 5 out of 5 stars.

 Utterly dismal. It only got half a star because you cannot rate 0 stars.<br>The first film I would have walked out of if I could (I relied on someone else for a lift home). I get the concept of cyclic patterns is interesting but to literally rewrite the dialogue over the same story is pathetic.<br>I found the characters bland and less than 2 dimensional the plot holes we're worst than Swiss Cheese. This film missed the whole feeling of the original which concentrated round a handful of characters over handful of locations. Rather than a cast of a thousand and zipping from location to location with no real explanation or reason just for the sake of some cool visuals and quippy one liners. Most of this scenes could have been cut without affecting what semblance of a plot the film had. I really don't rate JJ Abrams after this I had little respect for him before.<br>I seriously hope this doesn't affect the careers of any of the actors involved they had little work from and what appears like poor direction and editing.

 It's light on substance but tremendously (and necessarily) develops its new gaggle of characters who are unanimously more dimensional than any from either previous trilogy. Kylo Ren in particular is a standout: in memorable contrast to Vader's foreboding calmness and penchant for force-dominant violence against underperforming subordinates Kylo features a spectacular temper twice destroying entire rooms with his wicked saber in response to aggravating news.

 I think people are finally starting to wake up and realize what a unoriginal play it safe piece of corporate garbage the movie actually was. Especially now since the release of the Last Jedi. The movie was entertaining at points but with that uneasy I have seen this before feeling. The humor did hit at times. Got a good chuckle. Other than the nostalgia there is nothing to this movie. There is so much just shoved down our face. Wait didn't the Republic win? Who are these guys? I was once told to understand it you have to read the book. Why do I have to read a book to understand a movie? You can tell some of it is just to sell toys. Phasma I bet she is going to be bad ass...no. Darth Vader wore his helmet because he had to to survive. Kylo Ren wears a helmet just to look cool and sell more toys. They didn't take any risks with this movie. I could have wrote the script in my sleep. This script was probably written by JJ Abrams kid in his free time. This looks cool. This Death Star thing is cool. I am going to make a mega Death Star.

 The Force Awakens attempts to recreate the original Star Wars feeling so much so that it's storyline pretty much is the blueprint as A New Hope. While there are some solid character set-ups here and the story moves at a brisk pace the overall film has too much of a "been-there-done-that" feel to it. Don't even get me started on the fan-service. It's entertaining enough to warrant a watch it isn't terrible but it isn't good either. It's simply okay and judging from the universal praise it has acclaimed it's safe to say it's the most overrated movie of the year.<br><br>3/5 stars, 3.0,  Matthew D, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/941919463/, December 17 2017, N/A

It is packed with great action it has an wonderful cast (Daisy Ridley and Oscar Isaac being the stand-outs) and is very high in entertainment value. With the story half of the film is basically A New Hope understandably so to make the series feel like Star Wars again but I felt that this was a bit distracting despite the film doing a great job balancing old Star Wars with a new fresh blood. There were also things that happened in the film were pretty convenient the under-use of certain characters and questionable decisions made in the script. Otherwise The Force Awakens successfully reclaims the former glory of the Star Wars saga. The force is still strong with the franchise., 4.0,  Steven V, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/949849085/, December 17 2017, N/A
 The Force Awakens was exactly what I wanted but not what I expected it to be. It's great seeing those old faces again as well as fresh new characters. The feeling of being back in a galaxy far far away is only half of the amazing emotion you will get out of this tale., 5.0,  Cody M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/842424632/, December 17 2017, N/A
 My first reaction to this film was crushing disappointment. The first new Star Wars movie in ages and it's THIS?! Upon rewatching and re-rewatching and re-re-rewatching I've finally concluded that it's not a bad movie or a bad Star Wars movie and that my expectations were simply too high for what is ultimately only a nostalgia-fueled proof-of-concept. That's all it tried to be and that's what it succeeded at. <br>Bonus point for the marketing trolling everyone into thinking Finn would be the Jedi but I don't hold out much hope for future Abrams-headed Star Wars entries., 3.0,  Astria C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976951181/, December 17 2017, N/A
 I hate the movie. My expectations we're really high. Too many things in the movie doesn't make sense or are vague.

 The Force Awakens breathes new life into the Star Wars franchise by delivering a fantastic adventure full of action. Boyega Ridley and Harrison Ford lead the charge and have a delightful chemistry that helps the film work. The plot is fairly basic but is fine for a film tasked with giving us thirty years of history introducing old and new characters and being a start point for the new movies. J.J. Abrams did a very exceptional job at implementing practical effects mixed with beautiful CGI. The movie moves very fast almost too fast especially in the beginning. It would have been nice to have a few quiet moments early on but that's a small gripe. Some characters felt underused as well especially a certain baddy while another makes appearances but is obviously being saved for later films. I also feel like we didn't get enough answers to the questions we had going in this isn't a bad thing but kind of stinks. I can guarantee you though I'll be first in line for Episode VIII., 4.5,  C.J. H, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/912083053/, December 20 2017, N/A
 Everyone complains that it is a copy of the previous but I personally don't care the presentation of a female hero as the protagonist is very interesting in addition to Finn one of my favorite characters and I want to know more of him. The villain Keylo is a risky ... I like it because it is a kick to all of us who expected a great villain opting for one who livesunder the Darth Vader shadow and is presented as a mediocre villain almost reminds me of what happened Metal Gear Solid in its second installment., 4.0,  Karla M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976962514/, December 20 2017, N/A
 Easily the worst of all the existing Star Wars films to date. The characters are unrelatable characters that only serve to appease the PC-Police and do nothing to enrich the narrative which is a shameless retelling of Episode IV. Abrams stitches together some very engaging visuals but they only moments between characters that spend more time exchanging vacuous platitudes and sequences that feel very out of place in the Star Wars franchise., 1.0,  Phiip M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976969204/, December 20 2017, N/A

 A flashy but fairly empty rehash of ANH that fails to present a purpose for needing to exist. The perceived universe is small compared to previous SW films and the perceived stakes are low (entire planets are destroyed and there's essentially no emotional impact). Original characters aren't supposed to be the focus of the film but their inclusion without much explanation of their character arcs between ROTJ and TFA is unsatisfying at best. As a stand-alone movie it's a cliche-heavy action flick., 0.5,  Mark H, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976934250/, December 20 2017, N/A
 This is somewhat a reshoot of a new hope. It is very good in visuals but weak in characters and especially in the handlying of the protagonist.

 Exciting and sentimental The Force Awakens adds some new flare to the Star Wars Saga though where it falters is that it goes by too fast without being able to really relate to these new characters. Much of it feels like exposition and a set up for a trilogy and it almost tries to do too much in its 2 hour 15 minute run time. It doesn't always feel like classic Star Wars because of its fast paced nature but its glorious moments and thrilling galactic visuals more than make up for these faults. It's probably the best film you'll see with as little character development it has and it's a film that leaves you wanting to see so much more., 4.0,  Josh C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/910875686/, December 19 2017, N/A
 The look and feel of movie is great way better than the prequels but the rehashing of ideas are insulting to star wars fans. the killing of han solo by Kylo is too similar to vader and kenobi.

 Can you die of happiness? This movie is the best Star Wars ever (yes I am an OT junkie so I know that ESB is damn close but there are like 45 mins of Dagobah which is a really downer.). Rey is a perfect character Finn is a blast Poe is charming (and I wish we got more) and BB-8 is a delight. Our beloved OT characters are amazing (with the obvious exception of Luke though my heart cries each time Rey says "Luke Skywalker? I thought he was a myth." The landscapes of Jakku are breathtaking and watching Rey grow into her powers is inspiring. The lightsaber battle on Starkiller base is one of the best.

 Overall I enjoy FA. I think the pacing script and dialogue all work really well for what it is. This is definetly a Disney movie wrapped around Star Wars. I was not a fan of it leaving so many questions open ended. Such as... How did the First Order come to be and get so powerful? Who is Snoke? Why is Rey So powerful? Etc. Also didn't like the Starkiller base. Just really boring as a plot device at this point. Overall though I liked big portions.

 You may argue that this film isn't great or even good and that there are superfluous bits that make the film drag. I loved it immensely.

 I waited for this to come out on Netflix because despite the strong reviews I knew I wouldn't like it. I was right. The acting is solid enough so is the aesthetic. However the story is absolute garbage. In fact the story is so bad so asinine so immature so stupid that I found it personally insulting. I am insulted personally by the stupidity of the writers. Who did Disney hire to write the script? Children? Maybe they did.

 This was a very disappointing movie experience for a die hard Star Wars fan. Where to begin... do you think Tony Stark "witty humor" dialogue belongs in Star Wars? Then you'll love the jokes in this one. Do you like a strong villain like Darth Vader? How about the quiet bad ass type villain Darth Maul? Or the cool calculating villain like Count Dooku? Well Kylo Ren is none of these things. The new characters are lame and feel jammed into the movie. Rey is good at everything she does without any explanation. Luke at least got a bit of dialogue out of Obi-Wan in ANH about becoming a skillful star-fighter pilot like his father. I love Han Solo he's great but I gotta say that Harrison Ford is DONE with Star Wars. My goodness you can just see the resent on his face and the hate in his voice... his performance was tired and he probably should not have been in the movie at all given how little he appeared to care. The story was a monumental disappointment. The entire film I was thinking "how does this connect to Return of the Jedi?" Didn't the rebels beat the Empire? Where is Luke? Why is a robot suffering from depression? It was a nonsense roller coast ride with boring fight scenes and terrible climactic space battle at the end. Also maybe it was just the movie theater I was in but the sound was thin. The space ships had no weight to them. The First Order made for a lame enemy. They just make a super death star and the emotional weight of losing five whole planets to their terrible power is completely lost because that sequence is so fast and none of the characters in the film seem to give a shit that five planets and their entire populations are destroyed. Also the filmmakers were so proud of themselves for not using CGI but all that means is that some of the animals on Jakku were puppets/costumes. But then speaking important characters like Maz Kanata or Snoke are entirely CGI? C'mon I don't take issue with the use of CGI - look at Yoda in the blu-ray version of Phantom Menace but you can't say how you're using old school film techniques and then just not use puppets and costumes when it matters... Very disappointing and I really do not consider this movie any more valid of an entry to the Star Wars expanded universe cannon than the creation of the yuuzhan vong Vader's secret apprentice or death troopers. Would give zero stars if I could., 0.5,  Sean F, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976963186/, December 19 2017, N/A

 Really wanted to like this and had high hopes. I even dragged my girlfriend to the cinema and hoped that she would be interested in Star wars after seeing it. Just a mediocre rip-off of A new hope. Poorly written lead characters. The plot focuses a lot on Rei which is overpowered and has a really bland personality. She is just uninteresting and boring to follow. Finn is a useless sidekick that ruins the mood and tension with to much slapstick. I get the feeling that a lot of people don't like the movie but pretend they do because its a female lead character.

 When compared to the originals this is a great movie. It is right up there with A New Hope and Empire Strikes back due to the solid plot and great action and themes throughout the movie. The newest antagonist Kylo Ren portrayed by Adam Driver is absolutely great he gives a bone chilling performance. Not forgetting Daisy Ridley and Carrie Fisher who also give great performances. This movie is very reminiscent of episode IV: A New Hope. However George Lucas himself said "Star Wars is like poetry it repeats itself". In this case this is not a better movie than IV but its great fun and I recommend it to anyone who loves the Star Wars movies., 4.5,  Max W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976943395/, December 17 2017, N/A
 This movie is enjoyable to watch but you will have absolutely no interest in watching it even a second time. Rey and Finn are just terrible un-interesting characters. I don't care if they die. The way Luke and Han are treated by JJ Abrams is just terrible. He completely ruins their arc and trashes Luke's classic archetype of the hero who redeems his father., 0.5,  Revned B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/900767455/, December 17 2017, N/A
 Tras un tiempo después de verla en el cine y habiéndola asimilado con calma tengo que decir que es como un reinicio de la saga Star Wars para las nuevas generaciones. Recoge un poco de todo de la trilogía original (episodios IV V y VI) y voila! Tenemos esta película. Esto puede molestar a algunos y no importar a otros la cuestión es que aún sabiendo que es un mezclote de ideas ya vistas J. J. Abrams sabe llevarlo todo con buen ritmo y buen criterio haciendo una película muy entretenida de ver. No sabemos por qué Rey está tan dopada de Fuerza y por qué sabe usar tan bien la espada láser por arte de magia pero bueno... supongo que eso lo explicarán en las siguientes películas... O no. Kylo Ren sin casco decae mucho., 3.5,  Nayru M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976948503/, December 17 2017, N/A

 Simply charming. I get all the gripe about it being a rehash of the original. But if you can look past the similarities (there are a lot I will admit) you're looking deeply into a new corner of the galaxy filled with new and lovable characters.<br><br>Kylo Ren is possibly the most interesting Star Wars villain as he has so much inner conflict so seeing this play out over the next two films will be reason enough to keep tuning in.<br><br>Very glad that JJ Abrams was selected to direct Episode IX. He's proven he knows how to make a 'Star Warsy' Star Wars film and now that he's given a nod to the originals he can put his own spin on the final installment in what should be an exciting and emotional cap to another great trilogy., 4.5,  Thomas H, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976913062/, December 17 2017, N/A

 Im not a particularly a big fan of the Star Wars franchise. For a long time I found the Revenge of the Sith the most enjoyable of the lot. A New Hope and Return of the Jedi were probably the best of the series in terms of story tone and humour. Thats until now. Screw nostalgia the only thing which made the originals good is the time of its release and how revolutionary the trilogy was. The Revenge of the Sith had far much more action and story progression. But The Force Awakens blows it out of the water for action. Humour is a little more grown up and much less cheesy. It does seem like the same old rebels attach the spaceship scene which was the focal point of new hope and empire strikes back. And another lovechild turns bad so for originality its lacking in the plot. It does have a good tone in terms of the legend of the force and all the stories of the great battle. The First Order has emerged welcomingly however and I look forward to a much more grown up series with action like this one., 4.5,  Aaron M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/858556936/, December 17 2017, N/A

 This is the best Star Wars film of all time! There's so much to love about this movie it breathes fresh life into a franchise dead from the creators meddling with "special editions" and prequels.

 A great come-back to the roots even though the script may look like a remake of A New Hope. A great realisation much more appreciated than the one from the prequels. Great photography real sets not so much CGI great costumes great lightsaber battle and emotion great rythm. The last 30 minutes of the movie are pure happiness. And what may I say about the end which comes smoothly and at the right moment ? probably the best Star Wars since Empire Strikes Back., 5.0,  Valentin P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976946769/, December 17 2017, N/A
 A more original and better reboot to a franchise than Jurassic World but not as good as the Star Trek reboot. It feels like it plays it safe and its a little difficult seeing how these sci-fi icons have aged...not well. The happy ending from Return of the Jedi has eroded away and what we get is a galaxy where the dark side still exists the Empire exists in disguise as the First Order Luke has ran away from his troubles and Han and Leia are divorced...? Really? What a bummer. I know Kylo Ren is a little emo twerp but who can blame the kid for running back to the illusions of the past.

 A very fast paced and action-packed start to a new Stars Wars trilogy that will be adding new life to a saga already rich in great storytelling (though at times the execution has been off). The old trilogy characters returning adds to the nostalgia of Star Wars while the new characters introduce a new era of Stars Wars for a new generation. I was pleased to see that the overall theme had not changed with this new installment and loved the way it payed homage to the originals. Overall a great Star Wars film with only one clear issue: Starkiller base. While I loved the name of it for intents and purposes it was just another Death Star for the resistance to destroy. In this regard I would have liked to see something more original but that's really my only complaint that isn't nitpicky. Thank you JJ Abrams for a really good and fun Star Wars film., 4.0,  Zach N, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976944919/, December 17 2017, N/A

 J.J. Abrams clearly understood that with such a legend you cannot make many mistakes nor take too many chances. Some have complained that it was a remake of New Hope... but think about it. The prequels veered of the path and they did not flow well for that Lucas has been crucified. Don't get me wrong... he deserves it for Jar Jar. But J.J. knew that he had to do justice and make up for the prequels. It is not lost on anyone in the opening scene where the guy says this is the beginning of making things right. <br>He did this movie was fantastic. Did not rely on the CGI and tied things together in support of the original piece of work. The score was masterfully done. The Skywalker themed music for Rey and how everything just fits well together. This is the foundation on the next two movies. Many questions that need to be answered. Hopefully in the third installment he will circle back and satisfy our thirst for answers. Who is Snoke? who are Rey's parents? How did Maz get the lightsaber? Is Luke really as powerful as the EU says? None of these were answered in the Last Jedi... soooo.... J.J. Abrams should have done all three.

 I don't know where to start with this movie. As with any high-profile sequel it's important to manage your expectations before seeing it. <br>But this is easily the worst of all star wars movies - including the awful (albeit for different reasons) Phantom Menace.<br><br>The biggest letdown is the overall story. More specifically the way nothing makes any sort of sense for the average viewer. <br>How can the First Order afford to build a superweapon that's an order of magnitude greater than the previous ones? Especially when we're supposed to believe that they're basically some kind of imperial remnant - with less resources and a stronger Republic opposing them. Which brings us to the Resistance. The movie shows us the planet of Jakku where several Imperial Star Destroyers litter the landscape after being decisively defeated by the Republic/Resistance/Rebellion. <br>But all of that military power is gone now so the Resistance is back to fighting with X-Wings and secret hideouts.<br>Also no-one seems to remember the Empire. Or the way the Rebellion defeated it. The same heroes that were publicly honored after the destruction of the death star are somehow a badly remembered legend now. <br><br>There were plenty of things wrong with the prequels. Cringy written lines cringier acting bad CGI Jar Jar midiclorians and action-packed senate meetings. But overall we were still given a story that made sense. The origins of Darth Vader the birth of the Empire the fate of the Jedi and so on. You can watch Revenge of the Sith and A new Hope consecutively and they'll make sense.<br><br>And I'd even forgive them for making a senseless story up if that Story had been even marginally original. Star Wars is never going to be Shakespeare but aside from changing characters around we're essentially watching a remake of A new Hope. The only way to excuse this is to think of TFA as a remake rather than a sequel. Which might be what the creators strived for.<br><br>Sadly the story is not the only part of the movie that leaves me confused at times. <br>Most puzzling is the character of Rey. Despite being depicted as a malnourished scavenger on a sandy dustball on the outer rim she immediately becomes an expert pilot when escaping Jakku on the Millennium Falcon. And after having a minuscule amount of time handling a lightsaber later on she defeats the main villain on the movie.<br><br>The other characters aren't far behind when it comes to their badly written backstories.<br><br>Finn is supposed to be a stormtrooper deployed on his first real mission but his conscience get's the better of him when his squad is ordered to destroy the village. He also shows affection for his fallen comrade. So far so good. But within minutes he starts to fire on his own comrades in order to escape together with Resistance pilot Poe. Poe disappears after they crash on Jakku only to return for the final battle later on in the movie. Without explanation.<br><br>Last but not least I have to talk about the acting. Especially Daisy Ridley's interpretation of the art. Apparently opening your mouth and looking wide-eyed is the only expression you need apart from the occasional frown or scowl.<br><br>All in All I have to say the movie is an insult to every Star Wars fan prior to this movie.

 The Force Awakens continues to introduce new characters while also bringing back old favourites in a fantastically fun movie. Our new performers such as Boyega Isaac Gleeson and Ridley give likable and vibrant performances that can come across as overbearing at times but does stay true to the over the top science fiction lore. The film continues to build on the trilogy format of the series making it a great opener to a hopefully strong series. The designs are fantastic with J.J Abrams giving a great traditional and unique look to the film as well as making exciting and adventurous action. BB8 is a great mascot for this franchise as this inventive puppet shows emotion and fun while Adam Driver's Kylo Ren showcases the immense emotional strength of these characters and stories while also making for an intimidating and threatening character. Though it can seems rushed and packed at times this will certainly please fans of all ages making for a great family Christmas movie!, 4.0,  David O, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/892230410/, December 15 2017, N/A

 Strong visually with exciting new characters I couldn't help but feel like TFA was a reboot-rehash of the old films rather than a film of its own. The only place where we are challenged is the death of Han Solo which although it is very sad to know we won't be seeing him again does give a certain weight to how evil our villain is for future installments in the series. Otherwise the newer-bigger deathstar premise was surprisingly unimaginative but I assume the studio wanted to retell the old story a bit to make new audiences familiar with what a Star Wars film is. I liked how Luke only appears at the end but Leia's character on the other hand felt inconsequential - like they just put her there for the fans. JJ Abrams is a crowd-pleasing director and I don't think he was actually a good choice for this film and the interesting creatures new environments felt less immersive present than I was hoping.

 I saw the opening midnight showing of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. I'd say first off that the movie seems pretty typical for a J.J. Abrams movie: strong on character development and action but weak on plot. I'd say though that perhaps the plot had a little more strength than the typical Abrams movie while the character development and especially the action didn't quite rise to Abrams' usual standards.<br>I found the most compelling character development to take place between Han and Leia. I also found that Abrams managed to imbue the movie with more than a sprinkling of the ironic humor that made the original three Star Wars movies so funny easily surpassing what often seemed like forced humor in the three Star Wars prequels. The action however simply couldn't live up to the prequels which featured what are still easily the two greatest live-action lightsaber duals in the Star Wars universe. I got the feeling that Abrams who as I understand it grew up watching the original three went out of his way to avoid his usual glaring plot holes and avoided going to the action extremes of the three prequels to make The Force Awakens feel more like the original three.<br>Perhaps nothing successfully evoked the feel of the original Star Wars movies better than Abrams' use of John Williams' score both the old and the new-providing at appropriate points a sense of sorry and longing a sense for foreboding or a sense of excitement. I literally laughed and cried. The very last scene of the movie left me with a tear that ran all the way down my left cheek.<br>The Force Awakens contained at least two major plot reveals and set the stage for what I suspect might be an even more major plot reveal in Star Wars VIII: The Force Returns in 2017.<br>While my favorite parts involved the original Star Wars cast members I found Daisy Ridley a fresh young talent as the new heroine and John Boyega wasn't bad as Finn either.<br>I'm not usually a big fan of 3D but I thought Abrams made rare good use of it like when a star destroyer suddenly appeared about to collide with my face.<br>I'm having trouble deciding whether I like The Force Awakens any better than the three prequel movies. While I hated Jar Jar Binks I never otherwise disliked the prequels the way that many fans did. If I had to guess about other fans I'd say that more of them will rank The Force Awakens below the original three but above the prequel than any other ranking among fans., 5.0,  David L, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/807508297/, December 10 2017, N/A
 I found this Star Wars film to be the best one they have created! What I enjoyed most were the aspects of family such as the familial wants that both Rey and Kylo Ren seek throughout the film. Both characters are very different from one another. For instance one character believes they have it all and wants nothing to do with their family while the other is hopeful for their family's return. Throughout the film Kylo's parents try to convince Kylo to return to the Resistance. Due to Kylo's actions he reminded me of a troubled teenager in the rebellion phase since he believes that he does not need his family's help. However Ren is the total opposite. She is very resourceful due to the fact that her parents left her at such a young age. Now as the movie continues we learn more about Rey's family history. I do not want to give away too much of the movie but we find out for sure what her relationship is to the Rebellion on December 15th when Episode VIII: The Last Jedi comes out ., 5.0,  Daron%20 P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976913496/, December 7 2017, N/A
 Star Wars Episode IV the remake: best way to describe this. 80% of this movie is a copy and paste of the original trilogy's first film the New Hope.<br><br>There are good things with this film the intro and very end scene are suspenseful with nice payoff: but I feel that they stand out because of their originality. Had the film gone that route: to make clearly original scenes and story it could stand on its own: this film does have 5 star material. <br>But as I said overall it's a copy and paste of Episode IV.<br><br>The main reason why I think this is because of the appearance and clothing along with their role in the story. Rey the hero has Luke's desert-peasant attire Ren the villain is trying WAY to hard to be a new Vader Hux the general is Tarkin. These characters look almost identical in many ways.<br>Even the story and settings are painfully obvious the desert planet the snow planet the Deathier Star. The x wings bombing the Death Star the Yoda teachings of the force the bar scene the Falcon shooting about 2 Tie Fighters: all clearly present.<br>The characters I will remember are Snoke (very big and intimidating while still old and frail) Maz BB 8 and Phasma. But again Emperor Yoda (both old and short too!) R2D2 and Boba Fett (cold mysterious masked badass that fans will adore despite doing jack shit in the story).<br>But I will say this who the hell is FN-2199? 'That guy that shouts "traitor!"' just shows up with a psudo-lightsaber and fights Finn. I want to see more of this dude. Also some of the new aliens are entertaining to look at.<br><br>But of course there's more things to talk about<br>Kylo Ren had some big shoes to fill considering everyone knows that he's this film's Darth Vader. But his execution is that of Anakin Skywalker in that it fails. His mask and lightsaber are okay but he clearly shares Anakin's tantrums and wimpiness making him more of an angsty teen than a scary supervillain. He wasn't as terrible as Hayden Christensen but the similarities exist. Combine this with the 'daddy issue plot' stolen from IV and being a Vader fanboy and it makes things worse.<br>Also there are times where the film is either rushed or elements of the film have no buildup Death Star 3.0 and the planets it destroyed are good examples of this if I knew about these things I would be preparing myself for the fireworks instead of having them gloss over so quickly.<br>I have no idea who Rey is as a character in that the film keeps on changing her personality. This isn't character evolution it's sloppy inconsistency. She starts out as a poor hardworking badass genius and then is suddenly constantly panicking like a headless chicken then she becomes Luke. If she evolved she would still show the traits of her past self but that is never implied.<br>Han Solo and his sidekick Chewie played their roles fine afterall they are directly relevant to the backbone of this plot. And it made sense to have Luke have such importance in the plot. However everyone else felt shoehorned in oh hi Ackbar! Hey R2D2 want to see your replacement?<br>Finn was a breath of fresh air: his character was unique for his normalcy and flaws and his despair in his introduction was very emotional but he was quite annoying at times. Also the sudden implied romance between him and Rey didn't feel subtitle. <br>Infact the comedy of the film was quite hit or miss some moments felt so stupid and hammy that they broke the flow of the film sometimes. Though you did have good things as well like BB's lighter thumbsup.<br><br>I would say that while this film was entertaining it was a remake more than it was a sequel. The film was too self conflicted in what it really wanted to be: something new or something stuck in the past., 2.0,  Thomas W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/906986317/, December 7 2017, N/A
 A return to form after the dismal prequels. Part of the magic of the original trilogy was it's sense of wonder and love of cinema. The original trilogy was more about the magic of movies than the inert space politics of the prequels. Abrams' love of cinema and Star Wars is apparent. I had a rip-roaring good time at The Force Awakens. To me early Star Wars films were love letters to movie making. They were about the power of movies to transport and entertain. I completely lost myself in The Force Awakens. It recaptured the hammy old-fashionedness of the original trilogy and I was sad when it ended. This felt like binge watching an impeccably made old-fashioned serial., 4.5,  Rob D, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/827418803/, December 7 2017, N/A

 Oh man...well here it is. After a controversial turn for George Lucas to give Lucasfilm to Disney and retire from Star Wars back in 2013 three years of anticipation from director J.J Abrams to direct the next film the eventually overhype expectations fans created and being received as months passed by with disgust and negativity from fans we have the CANONIC episode of Star Wars Episode 7: The Force Awakens. And I gotta say this film gets...quite the reputation around the internet and I don't mean this in a good or agreeing way. And look don't' worry i'm not gonna spend this review explaining why people are wrong and how amazing this movie was and how you're stupid for thinking that. If you don't like Force Awakens it's fine especially if you feel there's legitimate issues with it. I just only have issues when people try to act as if this 'insulted' them as a fan of movies or Star Wars. Which i've seen people rate it as and it...honestly baffles me to be honest. But anywho back on topic now what are my thoughts on the film still you might ask? Well they're still pretty positive. Though they've changed since watching it back in December in 2015.<br><br>So here's a fun fact about my experience for Force Awakens: This was gonna be my first time watching a Star Wars film in cinemas and for opening day I went with a friend to a packed theater at midnight and honestly it was one of the most fun theater experiences i ever got to feel as a fan. Now onto the film so like i mentioned before when I saw this film initially my reaction was heavily positive (even tempting enough to give it a 9). I described it being "...very entertaining from start to finish....and I know many people will be disappointed by this film and will be sadly nitpicked to death because of this one major issue i had (which was about how it felt like a rehash of the original trilogy) but in the end i had a good experience for this film. It was a great film with a lot flaws." Now after re-watching the film I can say my thoughts since haven't really changed much since. It's still an incredibly entertaining and solid soft reboot to Star Wars that I think now lets me see the flaws i've had with it that aren't just regurgitated opinions everyone has said about 40000 times.<br><br>Despite having it's flaws like a really fast pace (that I feel keeps the film from expanding its new characters properly) a story that while i won't say really feels like a rehash I think just needed some more tweaking if anything to make it feel more like a continuation than making it a bit of a retread (I.E: Starkiller Base) and wished it went from what Michael Arndt came up with for the film before Abrams and Kasdan came in likable new characters that unfortunately don't always benefit from the films super fast pace and as a result create some flaws in their arcs (from both Rey Finn and Poe) and some editing some original trilogy references and the context of this universe not being done well I can't say it is enough to break the film for me. Because to me Force Awakens felt like Return of the Jedi done properly. And I mean this as a good thing. It's simple but well done soft reboot small scale story is well executed and competent in its own right the new characters are incredibly likable (especially Kylo Ren) the original trilogy characters are given something to do and their impact on the story is actually meaningful and not forced J.J's action sequences being so well executed that it's not only just a lot of fun but serve to not slow the film down the well done underappreciated new ideas to this sequel trilogy (I.E: What the original cast has been up to the outline of the story Kylo's force abilities etc.) and a solid John Williams soundtrack while somewhat weak on its own but good with Force Awakens. Now look Force Awakens isn't perfect and it's not the best Star Wars film either. But it is certainly a competent soft reboot film that I feel stands well as a film and to continue and soft reboot Star Wars. I understand where a lot of people come from with their complaints and they have every right to critique it as a soft reboot. But to me this film did its job well and I personally must commemorate J.J Abrams Kathleen Kennedy and even Disney for AT LEAST trying. Because if they keep this up with Last Jedi and make this sequel trilogy truly stand well on it's own and do it's own thing then i'll be satisfied. It's a well done start but obviously not without its flaws., 4.0,  Shayan S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/951302741/, December 3 2017, N/A

 A rehash of ANH characters have no depth and Rey is a Mary Sue. It's been said but here it is again: Rey got where Luke was within an hour and a half while Luke took two movies and then some. Even Anakin wasn't as godly as Rey was. Also the movie completely shredded the OT in how it destroyed Luke's Leia's and Han's futures -- Luke is supposed to be the hero but now he's become a hermit and has allowed his best friend's son to run amok. Han is a smuggler AGAIN and worse he's no longer with Leia. The OTP is dead., 0.5,  Jennifer L, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976908125/, December 3 2017, N/A

 I liked the film a lot but my biggest problem are the major similarities to A New Hope. I understand that Disney was nervous in making a new Star Wars film with all the high expectations but I feel doing the story similarities backfired - at least for me.<br><br>I absolutely loved the cliffhanger (quite literally) at the end of the film and loved that Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker only appeared for a couple of seconds throughout the film yet he was mentioned constantly. I also loved the absence of Luke in all the promotions and such for the film as it really hyped up fans to see Luke Skywalker, 4.0,  Ivan S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976921569/, December 14 2017, N/A

 Not a bad movie thanks to the mostly solid visual effects and action but the character arcs are forced lazy and one-dimensional and it suffers from a recycled structure plot and themes., 2.0,  Fabricio G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/935947972/, December 14 2017, N/A
 Successes: There was a lot of hype leading up to this film. It had to succeed where the prequels mostly failed. It did. They did a masterful job of giving everyone the nostalgia moments while also mixing in a compelling story surrounding the new characters. Han Solo (Harrison Ford) Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and others from the original trilogy got great moments. However the film's highlights are Rey (Daisy Ridley) Finn (John Boyega) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). The new characters are all engaging and well-acted. The big scene between Kylo and Han was an emotional gut punch. As always the special effects were top notch and the score was phenomenal. There's a great story in here that works on its own and even better as the first chapter to a new trilogy.<br><br>Failures: There weren't too many of these. I did have an issue with some of this being too similar to A New Hope. Several scenes went beyond the idea of callbacks and felt more like retreads. I especially wasn't a fan of Snoke. I'm sure Andy Serkis will excel in the role going forward but he wasn't given much to do here. Snoke may get fleshed out in later episodes but for now he just feels like the Emperor to Ren's Darth Vader and nothing more.<br><br>Overall: With high expectations they went out and hit a home run. Despite a few too many similarities to Episode IV The Force Awakens was a stellar film. The new additions to the cast were all tremendous and I found myself more interested in what they were doing than the stuff involving the iconic characters. This is the second or third best Star Wars film in my mind., 4.5,  Kevin P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976511688/, December 13 2017, N/A

 This to me wasn't super good. Sure it looked great and it almost put the franchise in its rightful position almost. This copied almost everything "A New Hope" did. Also how did Rey learn how to do jedi mindtricks in a matter of days. She also kicked Kylo Ren's a** and that was the first time that she had ever used a lightsaber. This to me was just a movie meant to bring people back to the franchise and to sell merchandise to little kids.

 A star wars film with star wars feel and it fits right in with the others. Unfortunately it basically is the others. a new hope to be precise. Not enough risk going on here felt it lent too much towards being a set up movie which no movie in its own right should ever be that should come naturally from a good film. the movie felt rushed in pase too certain parts felt they had gaps (how can you use the force with no training or knowledge) should have been called "let's hope" as they need that to get fans on board for the next one.

 Honestly loved this movie though it treads through familiar waters and basically is A New Hope 2.0. The Force Awakens is the kick-starter that we needed for the Sequel Trilogy.<br><br>The opening sequence where the First Order rains hell upon the Jakku Village was phenomenal and well-done. Then we're introduced to Kylo Ren who awes everyone by freezing a blaster shot in mid-air. I like the development they went with Kylo Ren. Though I hated he removed his mask when interrogating Rey I reflected later on it and realized that J.J. Abrams wanted to show that Kylo Ren/Ben Solo is an extremely conflicted individual that fears he won't live up to the legacy of Darth Vader. It was necessary to add a layer of development for his character to be further explored in future films. <br><br>The action is pretty much non-stop and is loaded with exceptionally well-done scenes such as Finn's battle against the Stormtrooper Rey and Finn aboard the Millennium Falcon on Jakku General Hux's speech to the First Order and the final battle between Rey/Finn and Kylo Ren. Han Solo and Chewbacca's first appearance had me cheering with such excitement and made me reminisce about the Original Trilogy. His death though it was absolutely was so well-done and perfectly captured the emotions of both Han Solo and his son Ben. <br><br>BB-8 was definitely the stand-out character and is a fantastic addition to the Star Wars universe. Loved the moments when he gave Finn a thumbs-up and cowered away in fear when Chewie roared at him.<br><br>Despite how I felt about the film I did have a few gripes with the film:<br><br>1. Captain Phasma was beyond useless and served no purpose to the movie or posed an immediate threat to the heroes. She seemed like an intimidating threat but was treated like such a joke.<br><br>2. Was it really necessary for there to be another planet-killing weapon? Though it could destroy multiple planets at once Starkiller Base is basically another Death Star. <br><br>3. Luke was teased so hard in the movie's intro yet he is completely forgotten until the final scene of the movie. <br><br>4. Supreme Leader Snoke was underutilized and seemed just like the Emperor all over again. <br><br>5. The biggest gripe I had was the fact that the movie overall is essentially a beat-for-beat remake of A New Hope. From a droid holding top-secret information to another planet-killing weapon the movie is a huge nostalgic trip that idolizes the Original Trilogy just as much as Kylo Ren idolizes Darth Vader.<br><br>Despite the flaws this movie is a wonderful experience and is a worthy addition to the Star Wars saga. It also trumps the Prequel Trilogy by a long mile., 4.0,  Arthur B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976913929/, December 11 2017, N/A
 This film is how you say it 'out of this world and amazing'. Star Wars the force awakens is one of the most amazing and really outstanding film i ever watch the lovable characters light-saber battles fight battles and of course the well crafted stories the the trilogy is known for plus you gotta love the villains too like my favorite kylo ren and i am so glad that Disney brought the trilogy back with full blast with this awesome and amazing film and i love Star was and i am such a huge fan I fucking love it. Overall Star Wars the force awakens is really my favorite star wars film ever also a new hope as will I can wait for the last Jedi that one is going to good can wait.

 The ten longest years of my life finally came to an end in 2015. The moment I have been waiting for since Revenge of the Sith was finally here and I was so hyped. You better believe I was there opening night to watch The Force Awakens.<br> The movie starts off with a bang introducing Poe and Kylo Ren. Probably my second favorite scene from the movie. I was really impressed with Kylo Ren and his force capabilities which I thought rivaled that of Darth Vader. And that is where the excitement came to an end.<br> The rest of the movie seem liked J.J. Abrams asked George Lucas if he can copy his homework. Then George agreed but told Abrams to change it up a bit so it doesn't look like he copied it. There are many parallels between The Force Awakens and A New Hope. I know some people enjoyed it and others like me wanted something fresh but you can't always get what you want.<br> That is why I think Rogue One was more successful than The Force Awakens. Rogue One brought something new to the table. It told a story that has not been told before. It fills the gap between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope and tell us how the rebels stole the plans for the Death Star. Rogue One also had more battle scenes where The Force Awakens and other Episodes fall short of. And a lot of people and not just me find the increase of combat scenes appealing. Rogue One was something fresh. <br> I believe that J.J. Abrams could have improved The Force Awakens with some changes. For example Abrams could have improved on the murder of Han Solo by Kylo Ren his son. Although it's a very emotional scene it could have been more intense if that is where Luke shows up who is too late to save his best friend and watches him perish. Or they couldn't save Rey and Kylo escapes Starkiller Base and teaches her the Dark Side of the Force. Again I wanted to see something new happen. <br> I also think the lack of struggle Rey has with her recently discovered Jedi powers is a disappointment. It would have been nicer to see her develop her skills and struggle just like all the other Jedi have done before her. Perhaps this will happen in the next Episode. We shall see.<br> I have to give props to J.J. Abrams on the ending. That is probably the realest cliff hanger ever created in cinema. Not just because they show Luke who doesn't say anything and then cuts to the credits but because Luke was standing on the edge of a cliff.<br> The saving grace for this movie is the characters from the Original Trilogy. I think Abrams realizes this too because he lets Mark Hamill talk crap about the new trilogy and get away with it.<br>All in all the movie didn't really live up to the hype and to my expectations. It became boring really fast and I felt like I was having some déjà vu. And Rey seems way more powerful than Luke Obi-wan and Anakin when they were Padawans. And I really couldn't care for the new characters. The Force Awakens felt more like The Force Rolls out of Bed., 2.5,  Even F, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976765165/, December 10 2017, N/A

 Although not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination this movie is vastly overrated. The movie is a basic rehash of the original Star Wars movie which follows a droid with secret plans for the Resistance but falls into the hands of a poor nobody with force sensitivity. The film adds some new twists such as Finn who is a stormtrooper turned Resistance fighter. Kylo Ren comes on strong and then takes his mask off and so all respect. I would have been more intimidated by a 12 year old and honestly it would have been more interesting if that did go that route. Harrison Ford does a great job reprising his role as Han Solo and there are some excellent battle sequences. Unfortunately this movie will take a hit now that many of the cliffhangers from it were destroyed by episode VIII.

 This is the worst most laugh-out-loud (unintentionally) funny movie I've ever seen. Someone give this director a lesson in screenwriting. Just a complete disservice to Luke (I mean my God anyone else who's seen the movie that breast feeding scene and no I am not joking). Leia...is space Jesus? (No I'm not joking there's webms of the scene in question). Just...what? Kathleen Kennedy wants to destroy this franchise and she appears to have done so.

 The continuation of an epic saga does not disappoints but neither excels.

 First thing first let me tell you that I absolutely unabashedly LOVE this movie. This is the best Star Wars film we ever had. No question there. Sure the original films were fun nothing wrong with that. But they were all you know kind of goofy over-the-top and unbalanced. This however is an opposite of that. This movie makes the original trilogy look like cheap school play. But again I'm not saying that the original films are bad. They're just pale in comparison to this new one. J. J. Abrams is a master of his craft. First he resurrected Star Trek and now he did the same thing for Star Wars. He's a true genius that deserves all the praise he gets. A true mastermind. A true filmmaker who understands what people want. He made the best movie of the past decade. And we true Star Wars fans should be thankful him for that. The characters in here are the best in the series. Rey and Fin are unarguably the most interesting multi-layered characters in the Star Wars universe. Heck I can say that they are one of the most interesting characters period. All in all this movie is amazing on all accounts.

 The Force Awakens suffers from JJ Abramsitis - a condition in which a story meant to be epic is simplified and boiled down to such a plot-convenient degree that it suddenly feels disappointingly small and which previously affected the Star Trek reboot.<br>At the same time it feeds the audience's nostalgia while spitting on it in ridicule. It rushes through its plot points counting on the production values to carry it. The only upside really is a rather clever choice of a villain which reveals at least the tiniest glimmer of hope that the creators of this film may be more aware of their work than they let on., 1.5,  Fabian S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/911514055/, October 29 2017, N/A

 Superb sequel that pays fine homage to the classic trilogy while actually introducing some new characters and ideas. The returning cast does fine for the most part with Harrison Ford stealing the show as Han Solo easily slipping back into the role and reminding you why he's one of the best characters in movies. The new members really shine though especially Daisy Ridley as Rey who is instantly appealing and follows in the standard set by Princess Leia as a more than compatible heroine. On the dark side Adam Driver is equally compelling as Kylo Ren who gives a menacing but tortured performance. Behind the camera J.J. Abrams pays fine tribute to the original movies even if he plays it a bit safe. The plot is a little thin and could have been tighter. However Abrams captures the style &amp action of the original films and wisely uses a great mix of practical &amp CGI effects almost to reassure fans after the debacle that was the prequels. BB8 in particular is a fantastic creation and it's toy is only going to be a bigger seller now that the film is out. Overall while time will tell if "Force Awakens" is equal to the original trilogy it is certainly better than the prequels (granted that's not saying much) and if this is the level of quality Disney is setting for the franchise than Star Wars fans will be happy for years to come., 4.5,  Johnathon W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/857932456/, November 24 2017, N/A

 The story is a retelling of A New Hope but the characters make up for it.

 "That is not dead which can eternal lie" - the immortal line from H. P. Lovecraft's The Call of Cthulhu which has increasingly become the mantra of Hollywood executives. The seemingly endless wave of remakes reboots re-imaginings and redundant sequels was bound to hit the Star Wars franchise sooner or later. It took less than ten years after Revenge of the Sith brought the ghastly prequel saga to a sorry conclusion for the powers-to-be (in this case Disney) to decide that audiences would be ready for another instalment or three.<br><br>Disney's acquisition of Star Wars from George Lucas coupled with the involvement of J. J. Abrams gave the sci-fi community and the film-going public reason to have positive expectations about this series again. Having already convinced themselves like long-suffering Highlander fans that things at least couldn't get any worse the hype steadily grew as the old cast members returned and more and more details were affectionately teased. It seemed as though everyone was pinning their hopes on this film working as though it was the last great hope that Star Wars could one day be good again. Sadly that last great hope has ended up as just another version of A New Hope leaving us dazzled by the modern visuals but otherwise disappointed.<br><br>It's true that I was initially dismissive of Disney's decision to buy Star Wars back in the days when I regularly wrote for WhatCulture!. It's also true that I have never been the biggest fan of Abrams branding him "the master of hype" and "our generation's Wizard of Oz" who is capable of making flashy tempting trailers but less capable at telling original stories. But as someone who looks upon the originals fondly - or at least acknowledges their deserved place in cinema history - I still count myself among those wanting this to be good rather than hoping that it would fail outright.<br><br>The single biggest problem with The Force Awakens is how desperately and despairingly unoriginal it is. It's positively flabbergasting how a film like this can be hailed as a masterpiece when it feels for all the world like watching a bunch of children dressing up and re-enacting their version of A New Hope. The toys may be faster and the Death Star-that's-not-but-actually-is might be bigger but it's still essentially A New Hope with modern-day editing. Whether you look at A New Hope as a Star Wars film or as a love letter to adventure stories it still holds up well enough (for all its problems) to make this feel immediately superfluous.<br><br>I will give Abrams some credit in that it is one of his better behaved efforts in terms of the camerawork. There is less of the irritating lens flare that there was on Star Trek or Super 8 and the action sequences don't look like they were assembled purely for the basis of making the trailer look exciting. But that being said it's clear that the two 'Trek films he made were essentially just practice for this. The lightspeed sequences here are almost identical to the hyperspace sequences from Star Trek Into Darkness.<br><br>The presence of the older cast warrants a further comparison with 'Trek. There's a conscious effort here to bring back the original actors to give the project their blessing and pass the torch just as in Star Trek Generations or certain episodes of The Next Generation TV series. There are some lovely moments here: the chats between Han Solo and Leia are the film's most human and emotional parts and Mark Hamill's appearance like an exiled King Arthur having Excalibur returned is a nice touch. But their presence only serves to remind us how good the originals were and adds doubt as to whether the new blood are good enough to hold things up on their own.<br><br>The Force Awakens is massively derivative from the outset both in the general movements of its plot and its specific details. Jakku is just Tatooine by any other name BB8 is R2-D2 the plans for Luke's home are the plans for the Death Star - even the early deaths are a straight lift from Anakin's vengeful slaughter in Attack of the Clones. It scores out over that film by at least pretending to break from the mould rather than insulting our intelligence by trying to argue that everything fits in with the existing canon. But it's ironic that a film which claims to break with the Star Wars Extended Universe has ended up borrowing so nakedly from its forebears.<br><br>Not only are we in overly familiar territory but The Force Awakens has moments where it is very unsure of itself. There are at least two occasions in the script where a dramatic situation is defused by the characters stopping to take the piss out of themselves and both times it feels forced and underwhelming. You can't build up something as serious or significant then slip into Spaceballs and then back again as if nothing happened. It undercuts the stakes of the drama in a very jarring manner.<br><br>Then there is the plot to consider. On top of its overt resemblance to (and invocation of) A New Hope The Force Awakens has several moments of narrative carelessness. The biggest one is the scene with Darth Vader's helmet we don't get any explanation as to how Kylo Ren got it or how it survived being incinerated at the end of Return of the Jedi it's just foisted upon us because it's a dramatic image. Additionally the film makes us feel like Poe is dead less than 30 minutes in and then provides no explanation for his survival when he turns up again. The original trilogy had plot problems too but at least the big stuff was explained away sufficiently to maintain our suspension of disbelief.<br><br>This lack of complete care translates into the character construction as well. Rey as a character is a welcome addition to the franchise Daisy Ridley makes the character fun and appealing her interplay with Finn is amusing and well-written and she is undisputedly the lead for two thirds of her screentime. But having started on so strong a footing the filmmakers chicken out about halfway through and turn her into a damsel in distress whom Finn has to rescue. It's all well and good that Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan wanted to make Star Wars more diverse and equal ops but surely the more interesting angle would be for Rey to use the Force to rescue Finn?<br><br>The character disappointment also seeps through into the villains which range from good to bafflingly timid. At the good end we have General Hux Domhnall Gleeson gives a committed and ambitious performance believably conveying someone who is power mad and intimidating. In the middle is Snoke realised by Andy Serkis it's fine though at this stage it's little more than Palpatine's appearance in The Empire Strikes Back with snazzier graphics.<br><br>And then at the bad end we have Kylo Ren who is little short of pitiful as a villain. As much as the trailers tried to make him threatening he's ultimately just Darth Helmet trying to be all big and terrifying but coming across as anything but. As Sylvester Stallone found out in Judge Dredd walking around with a bucket on your head stops being scary if you're just going to keep taking it off. In the climactic lightsaber duel in the snow his long hair and gormless expression may him look like a wetter less capable version of Prince Caspian from The Chronicles of Narnia and the film's attempts to set up daddy issues with Luke feel very half-baked.<br><br>Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens is a disappointing and derivative start to the new Star Wars trilogy. It cuts the mustard as two hours of empty popcorn fun and it is slightly better written than Revenge of the Sith but after all the hype and promise it needed to be a whole lot better. The involvement of Looper director Rian Johnson in the upcoming Episode VIII does leave some cause for hope just as The Empire Strikes Back managed to improve by having a different director. But putting that and Rogue One out of our minds for a moment this film remains staggeringly mediocre., 2.0, , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/901318108/, November 20 2017, Super-reviewer

However we got this reboot crap that almost repeats the first film but instead with different characters.

 A film so beautifully crafted that I had to see it twice. I'll admit the first time I saw this film I walked out of the theaters puzzled not knowing if I liked the film or not. I went online to read on the film and understood the film better. After that on a quiet afternoon I decided to go see it again and it was better the second time around. Now onto my review. **SPOILERS AHEAD**<br><br><br><br>The old and new characters all fit very well in the film and didn't feel forced. They all had their own spot in the film and each played an important role in what the story is about and how it unfolds. The villain we will accustom to in the next two films known as "Kylo Ren" was very well done. Adam Driver could not have played him any better. The way they portrayed him to be this badass dark side villain when he was really an immature temperamental not fully trained to his full potential boy who still had a good side to him....which he had to prove to Snoke he had. By doing so his dark side had to take over and kill his father Han Solo. Now we know there is no good left in him and that he is pure evil. At the end of the film we learn he will finish his training and be stronger than ever in the next film which I am quite excited for. Now enough rambling about the bad guy onto the main guys the good guys the coolest bunch you'll ever meet.<br><br>We have been introduced to Finn and Rey let us start with Finn a stormtrooper who decides he doesn't like how the First Order works and doesn't want to be bad. So he decides to run away and comes across Po a resistance pilot who gives him the name Finn. He finds out they have to get BB-8 to their base because he has a map showing where the missing Luke Skywalker has gone to. Finn and Po go to Jaku a desert planet where Finn meets Rey who has been waiting for her parents to return home for years. Rey and Finn are spotted by TFO (The First Order) and have to escape which leads them to meet Han Solo and Chewbacca...etc. What I like about Rey is she is a lot like Luke seems very weak comes from a desert planet where she has no family and comes across new friends and ends up being an unlikely hero who stops the Dark Side from destroying the galaxy. She is very heroic brave and never thought of quitting the mission of getting BB-8 to the base. Finn is the comedic person in the film which I don't think he was supposed to be. He has a great personality and a good heart. Especially his will to overcome the TFO. He seems cowardly in the start but shows his will to fight and his heroics and love for Rey that he will fight beside her the whole way. <br><br>Every character in this film can be explained in many ways because it was so good. But instead of me typing about them you should see the film for yourself. You won't be disappointed. This masterpiece will surely be on the top with Empire Strikes Back as one of the best Star Wars films of all time. Let's hope the both sequels can top this one!, 4.5,  Frost M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/958739715/, October 22 2017, N/A

But I guess I enjoyed it for what it was. A throw back to the Original. It added some new things but for the most part it almost followed the Original too much and was too scared to do it's own thing. I'm fine with doing things differently as long as there done in the right way while maintaining the respect of the source material in the Original but I think this respected the Original too much and was like a bird stuck in a cage.

 Force Awakens was an attempt to bring back the classic Star Wars into modern day Media for normal movie goers I am sure it is near perfect with nostolgia and fantastic story telling but being honest it was purely an alright film.

 As a child of the early 80's Star Wars was a big part of my life growing up. This movie gave me chills!

 A generally fun and good looking movie to watch but ultimately loses its emotional weight by drowning the movie in nostalgia as well as spending more time on the revitalization aspect rather than making its own new film., 3.0,  Jay S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976646506/, October 9 2017, N/A
 Being a big Star Wars fan I was hyped to see my favorite Imperial-fighting crew join some new ones on the big screen and boy did this episode live up to the hype! The plot sounded awesome from the very beginning and it stayed that way with twists and turns I would never see coming until the credits came up on the screen! Also the background music by John Williams were just as good in this movie as it's ever been making every scene feel more like the franchise didn't go anywhere. Finally I'd like to say that there were a few scenes that looked almost like they were from the original movies with different locations!

 I absolutely loved The Force Awakens! The performances characters story action direction  writing and visual effects were all superb. It perfectly recaptured the spirit of Star Wars more so than the abysmal prequels ever did. I had an enormous childlike grin the entire time I was watching it. I was so engaged and so emotionally invested that I was easily able to overlook the films shortcomings. Can't wait to see the saga continue!

 I was super stoked for this movie. But the audience reaction (or lack of reaction) after the movie confirmed what I was feeling for most of it. It was muted. There was no applause no excitement no general feeling of "Wow this was a great film." I was actually bored. This is another J.J. Abrams rehash like Star Trek was. Except this time elements of Ep. V were in there as well. It didn't have the emotional punch and it didn't grab you like the original trilogy. It was even less original than the prequels and I can't believe I'm saying that. Yes go see it. Because it's Star Wars it deserves a viewing. But don't expect it to be amazing., 0.5,  Chloe S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/959950101/, October 7 2017, N/A

 The reviews for this movie are puzzling because it's just not particularly good. The plot isn't very strong there is a lot of action but it lacks a magical element found in the original movies., 0.5,  Justin S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/947189503/, September 15 2017, N/A
 This movie is miles ahead of the prequels to be certain still I could not help but think there WAS something missing due to the lack of George Lucas' involvement. I think it was mostly the dialogue. Lucas had a knack for cheesy but memorable line that came through in the originals and even the prequels ("only a sith deals in absolutes." "So this is how liberty dies. With thunderous applause." ).<br><br>Here the dialogue is serviceable and nothing jarring but it felt mostly like it was somebody simulating the original's style and yet not putting much effort into originality. Since Star Wars movies are usually endlessly quotable I wonder if this will hurt it in the long run.<br><br>My other major 'qualm' was the film's heavy leaning on the originals for not only the characters and story but pretty much the exact scenes were echos of the originals to the point where even certain plot 'twists' were predictable if you remembered how it went in the Episode IV.<br><br>SPOILERS:<br><br>Seriously. Opening on a desert planet with a droid with secret data that is vital to the resistance being sought by stormtroopers. A masked villain dressed in black using a voice modulator interrogates and kills some people aboard his giant doomship (note: this makes sense for the character given his motives but it is too on the nose in terms of the filmmaker's decision) .<br><br>By halfway they're in the Millenium Falcon. They end up in a seedy space-bar place with all kinds of unsavory creatures. We learn about a giant weapon that can kill planets and will destroy the rebel base if they don't demolish it. Oh and one of the heroes is taken to said weapon and needs to be rescued (well not quite) by the other heroes who sneak in and infiltrate the base.<br><br>The rebels go on a near suicide attack (there's even a trench run!!!) to destroy this weapon while it charges up to attack.<br><br>The heroes of the movie watch the older mentor/guide character get murdered by the baddie in the heart of the giant weapon.<br><br>END SPOILERS<br><br>Just because it is Star Wars doesn't mean you have to rip the blueprint straight from the original JJ. The prequel went for completely original stories at least! I would have liked to have been in the theater with a bunch of Star Wars nerds to hear them squeal in glee when certain characters pop in. It was not really pandering and I don't care about the massive coincidences that keep driving the events (that is Star Wars after all) but I sure hope the future movies forge new ground.<br><br>Even so there is novelty to be found here that makes it worthwhile to me. Finn was great John Boyega does an excellent job making him likable in spite of his inherently annoying qualities (like Luke but their characterizations and background are very different) and I freaking LOVE Kylo Ren. Interesting dichomoty there as each is a (spoiler) 'traitor' to their origins (/spoiler) and is Likewise the returning actors acquit themselves perfectly and had larger roles than I had anticipated.<br><br>As a vehicle for re-introducing the world and setting up the new characters this film excels. I genuinely cared about these characters and worried for their safety by the end. I am honestly intrigued to see where the plot goes. I also am in awe of the First Order's power and really wonder how the resistance plans to deal with it.<br><br>These are good feelings and these are what I would want out of a Star Wars film. If as in the original trilogy they continue to ramp up the scale and the stakes while keeping up the personal journeys of the heroes I can expect to enjoy this ride.<br><br>All in all the beginning was rather shaky (mostly because i was distracted by how hard it tried to match up with episode IV) the middle was entertaining thrilling and engaging whilst the ending was the emotional and visual crescendo is needed to be.<br><br>He treaded more carefully on safe ground than I would normally like but JJ proves he knows what Star Wars IS and how to put out a good movie.<br><br>Star Wars fans should probably give it a chance (just kidding I know you've already seen it)., 3.5,  Wesley M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/786463994/, September 13 2017, N/A

 Terrible movie! Jar Jar Abrams has ruined the Star Wars universe for the sake of playing it safe and making money. Most Star Wars fans are too blinded by their nostalgia to see this movie for what it truly is. A cash grab by Disney. Instead of respecting and continuing on what Episode 6 finished with it instead completely trashes it and makes it meaningless. The original cast of characters like Luke Han and Leia are all ruined by instead of growing and becoming better they become weaker people. Overall very poor and lazy story telling they literally had an endless universe to work with and they instead choose to make it the same plot as Episode 4 A New Hope. I don't understand how this movie has such a high rating but I am sure it must have something to do with their Disney buying the reviews and or the reviewer are blinded by their nostalgia.

 Rey beats Kylo Ren in a light saber battle even though she has no Jedi training whatsoever and Kylo Ren has been trained by none other than Luke Skywalker. Kylo turned evil and turned against Luke and then Kylo kills his own father Han Solo. That moment was supposed to a huge pivotal moment in the movie but it just totally fell flat and had no emotional impact whatsoever -- just killed off Han for nothing. As with many movies and TV shows these days a token black guy is thrown in to portray the sidekick to the white lead character. They care deeply for each other even though they barely know each other., 2.0,  Matt G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976675196/, September 8 2017, N/A

 This is probably the most fun film I've seen in 2015. This is my second official Star Wars film and I was super exited for its release. I went to the theater got my ticket and I had an absolute blast from beginning to end. It gave me everything I was expecting it to have. The acting is great. I loved and cared for every character in this movie. Rey and Finn are interesting and the relationship between them is very strong and sweet. I was surprised to see Han Solo and Chewbacca and even though I didn't see the original trilogy I was certain that they are as lovable in the other movies as they are in this movie. BB-8 is the most adorable droid. He just melted my heart. The effects look great and the story is easy to follow. The new villain Kylo Ren while not as awesome as Darth Vader is pretty cool and intimidating. The action is pretty good and the comedy is good. It was cool to see Leia and R2-D2. The only tiny issues with the movie is that the story felt a little recycled from A New Hope with Starkiller Base being the most bothering and I was kind of confused with the politics and the stuff with the Resistance and the First Order but only slightly so. Even though I didn't see the original trilogy I know the story of A New Hope. While watching this movie I realized that the story felt similar to that one's story. But the execution is so good that it doesn't really matter. I also found the climax to be a bit underwhelming. I also wish that Luke had more screen time but it's alright. Overall I think Star Wars Episode VII - The Force Awakens is pretty good. It's not perfect but truly no film is. It's about as good as a Star Wars film can get and it's a fun experience. I definitely recommend it for Star Wars fans and non-fans alike., 4.5,  Jazzmin M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/967538396/, September 5 2017, N/A

 I believe JJ was tasked with two objectives for episode 7 create a familiar movie that got all the old fans of the original trilogy cheering and bring a whole new level a mystery to the franchise by leaving out much detail as possible about what has happens prior to events of TFA and what will happen next. creating mass speculation about characters origins and intentions Fans are Looking at every detail in this film to uncover those mystery this gives the film much needed re-watch ability for die hard fans to keep them busy for the two years bestrewn the release of the next installment. in this respect Abrams did a fantastic job at keeping the fans asking for more., 4.5,  Cale W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976734014/, October 2 2017, N/A
 After the massive failure of the Prequels I had given up hope on this franchise. But this film literally breathed life back into the dead series. JJ Abrams crafts a movie which brings back all our favourite characters from the original trilogy as well as introduces some fresh new faces. Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher both return to their famous roles and provide an emotional core to the films story. Seeing Han and Chewbacca fly the Millenium Falcon once again will give any fan goosebumps. <br>But this films real strength lies in its new characters. Daisey Ridley is easily a standout as Rey giving us a protagonist who is not aware of her abilities and her family and makes the audience want to root for her. John Boyega's Finn is really funny and brings a lot of depth into the story. Oscar Isaacs Poe Dameron is charming but his screen time is limited. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren is quite brilliant as the character is much more complex than any other villain in the Star Wars Universe. <br>The visuals the cinematography and the score by John Williams is top-notch.The action is epic and the humour works very well. Especially the new droid BB8 is hilarious and brings plenty of laughs. <br>The only drawback of the movie is that the story feels a little derivative of the original trilogy. There are some parts which you have seen here and there. But other than that this film is a total blast from start to finish. <br>THE FORCE IS STRONG WITH THIS MOVIE, 4.0,  Rishabh S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/903791219/, October 2 2017, N/A

 I'm not a "Star Wars" fan. There I said it... This sequel to "Return of the Jedi" (not the garbage prequels) could possibly turn non fans like me into someone who is now interested in seeing the next episode! <br>Last we left off the rebels defeated the empire and all's well that ends well. Turns out a new empire is up to no good and the galaxy once again is in turmoil. A rebellious storm trooper flees the empire to join the new rebellion now lead by Princess turned General Leia. Throw in the return of Harrison Ford as Han Solo Chewbaka and a new strong female character (hopefully a new Jedi) and you have a very entertaining film.<br>There isn't much mumbo-jumbo in this installment. It's fast paced and fun with likeable new characters which allows you to forget about the film's flaws and just enjoy. I didn't like seeing Han killed off (oops spoiler) but it was a proper send off and the return of Luke at the very end nicely paves the way for the next film.

 I find it hard to judge Star Wars movies with a cool head because I'm always excited to see a new one when it's released and that excitement can overwhelm my judgement. When The Force Awakens first came out I immediately gave it five stars and declared it second only to Empire in quality. A bit of time and the release of Rogue One have given me perspective and convinced me to be more critical.<br><br>Don't get me wrong - it's still a good movie despite duplicating many elements of the ultimately still superior A New Hope. The first half of TFA is in some ways better than ANH despite owing it a huge debt. Nothing can top the opening sequence of ANH - Vader capturing Leia's ship the escape pod etc. But the establishment of Rey as a character shows her to be much stronger and more grown up and far less selfish and whiny than Luke is the first time we meet him. And her meeting up with Finn and the subsequent chase in the Millennium Falcon are fun and exciting in a way ANH doesn't get until much further in. Sure ANH has the burden of establishing the universe but there's establishing to be done in TFW too and I think it does a better job of pacing things in the first act.<br><br>Once Finn and Rey leave Jakku the movie begins to lose its way a bit. <br><br>The bit with the rathtars is fun but feels like it's from a different movie. <br><br>Maz's bar is an inferior knock-off of Mos Eisley and I was disappointed to learn that reggae exists even in a galaxy far far away. Maz herself is fun but the 'eyes' thing is a bit lame - she says Finn has 'the eyes of a man who wants to run' when he's more or less just said he wants to do exactly that.<br><br>If Finn believes Poe is dead why would he be so quick to assume the 'one hell of a pilot' is him - the only reason he'd react as he does? Can the Resistance only have one awesome pilot? That said though the long take of Poe flying around shooting stuff is really cool. <br><br>The fact that all scenes concerning the Republic government were deleted robs its destruction of any impact whatsoever (it's even less affecting than the destruction of Alderaan) and the fact that the Republic seems to be of less concern to the First Order than the Resistance doesn't make complete sense - surely destroying the Republic would be the first item on their 'ruling the galaxy' to-do list. <br><br>The Resistance attack on Starkiller Base (well the fighter bit) brings nothing new. On that subject why are they still using X-wings? Or at least why are they using ONLY X-wings? ANH (and R1) showed the older Y-wings alongside the X's and ROTJ had newer A's and B's. Have there been no new starfighters in that time? It's like resurrecting the Aston Martin DB5 in the recent Bond movies - the X-wings would be old technology but they've been brought back for purely nostalgic reasons. <br><br>Oh and I'm not sure you're allowed to use hyperspace the way Han does.<br><br>OK - I think that's most of my issues...<br><br>The Rey/Kylo scenes are great and it's fun to see Rey testing out her skills (mind trick etc) getting better as she goes until she fully embraces the Force and snatches up the lightsaber at the end. I also like the Finn-Han-Chewie infiltration scenes though I think Phasma gives up too easily.<br><br>Adam Driver is fantastic as Kylo an emo kid with a Vader fetish struggling to resist the light side. In more recent viewings watching this petulant manbaby lose his s#!t when things don't go his way reminds me of a certain real-world villain (though Kylo has much better hair). John Boyega is awesome as Finn pulling off the drama comedy and action with equal skill. His distressed body language in full Stormtroper armour is fantastic. Oscar Isaac is equally great as Poe all quick-witted charm. Gwendoline Christie is suitably imposing as Phasma and like Boyega manages a fine performance with no face. Nyong'o Gleeson Serkis and Grunberg are all great too. The oldies are all as good as they ever were and it's great to see them all again.<br><br>Hannah John-Kamen! Maisie Richardson-Sellers! Jessica Henwick! Whoo!<br><br>But Daisy Ridley is the real star here - she kicks absolute arse as Rey. She's physical athletic super expressive and she puts personality into every move she makes. Rey is officially my new favourite Star Wars character - partly due to the way she's written and partly thanks to Ridley. Besides being less annoying she's also more complex and better rendered than Luke was in ANH and the subtle exposition-light way in which the character unfolds is great fun to watch. <br><br>Thanks largely to Empire/Jedi cowriter Larry K the dialogue mostly sounds like natural conversation rather than data pouring out of the GL3000. That said though there is a LOT of exposition a lot of which consists of characters telling each other things they should already know ('Snoke turned our son to the dark side') or that they don't need to know ('Orange and black one of a kind'). And Han and Leia talking about 'our son' rather than calling him by name (saving it for the big reveal near the end) just comes off as weird.<br><br>JJ who has had some hits and misses in his career has excelled as director here bringing a distinctive but unobtrusive style to things (sans lens flares which I actually don't have a problem with but admittedly aren't very Star Wars). It has all the authentic wipes and things.<br><br>John Williams's score is predictably awesome. The CGI mocap costumes production design practical and sound effects (Burtt!) are outstanding it looks and sounds like the old ones.<br><br>Overall while not perfect and at times a bit too derivative it's a visually spectacular and rollicking adventure full of action humour drama and those big mythical themes.

 WTF??? This is sadly a disgrace to the original trilogy and even the prequels. This is destroying the Star Wars franchise. All this movie is about is selling toys and getting people hyped from the desperation of wanting to see Mark Hamill Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford together on screen again. The story was a copy and paste from the original 1977 Star Wars the characters are horrible everything goes wrong with this film other than the visuals.

 While not perfect The Force Awakens is a much-needed return to the fundamentals of Star Wars... and the result is the best entry in the series since The Empire Strikes Back. Combining the pure fun and excitement of the original film the darker atmosphere of The Empire Strikes Back and the exploration of good and evil as seen in Return of the Jedi The Force Awakens revitalises the series with newfound verve while setting up a conflict that builds on the threads laid out in the previous films. Perhaps not the best blockbuster of 2015--that award goes to Mad Max: Fury Road--but certainly the most satisfying and a definite relief after four very wonky Star Wars sequels/prequels., 4.5,  Dion D, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/789995880/, September 19 2017, N/A

 Basically a more politically correct version of Episode IV: A New Hope (the first star wars movie ever made). The story is beyond derivative.

 The Force Awakens got sold to the fans as a "star wars original" but in fact it was a total remake of Episode IV "A New Hope" directed by George Lucas. There are almost no new or creative ideas J.J. Abrams just took iconic elements from Episode IV "A New Hope" made them bigger and renamed them:<br>The death star moon is now a planet. The protagonist: Rey comes from a desert planet like Luke she lives a hard life but her life even seems to be "harder" as she struggles to find enough scrap metal to pay for her food and she has no family or friends to care after her. She is stronger in the force as everyone before seen in the Star Wars universe (like Luke used to be). She is a good engineer (like Luke) and a good pilot (like Luke). Besides the fact that Ray is an overpowered better looking female copy of Luke I just keep wondering why it was necessary to introduce Ray as a flawless angel? Good looking strong in the force strong in the will very smart and overall naturally talented in everything she touches and being very tough as she used to live a life like a Tibetan monk. Can we only admire her or even accept her as a new Star Wars hero if she is nothing else then perfect? That's just sad. In the end I actually could not identify with Ray overall because perfectness is just unhuman (even if you are a Jedi). <br>Also did I forget to mention that in "A New Hope" the death of an important resistance figure (Obi-Wan) who was kind of a mentor to the protagonist is caused by the antagonist wearing Black and a mask and is using a red sword? .....Well that did not happen in the force awakens did it? Damn yes it did... <br>I could possibly continue that List for many many more examples but I think I already have already proven my point. The thing is that I just cannot understand that all the critics including the ones that were hatin on the prequels seem to love this movie. At least the prequels had an own unique story other then this remake. Sure the movie had good visual effects and I even think that the actors and the whole team in terms of camera costume design and make up did a great job. Also I understand that after more then 10 years of the last Star Wars movie coming out and that entire "Star Wars religion" which has established so far the people were desperate to watch a new star wars movie and the nostalgics could enjoy the references which were made to the old movie. <br>BUT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MAKING REFERENCES AND DOING A REMAKE OF AN ENTIRE MOVIE!!!!!!!!! <br>For example when we find out in the force awakens that Han solo flew the millennium falken in less then twelve parsecs (just like we found out in a new hope). That would have been a good reference for our nostalgic fans of the franchise as it wouldn't have had major importance to the story over all. But to relaunch the fight between the rebels (now called the resistance) and the Imperium (now called first order) where the task of the resistance is to kill the death star/planet while the imperium/ first order try's to find the last jedi and rebels to kill or capture them is not just a reference it's a remake. <br>I really wanted to like the movie. I am not just a die hard fan of the first three movies I also loved the prequels. I read the books and I really hoped for a new epic Star Wars adventure. But instead I saw a recycled version of "A New Hope". In the end I feel cheated and disappointed. In my opinion the movie was well done but just does not deserve being called a Star Wars original as it has nothing new to offer and even installed the relaunch of the story in a very bad way in terms of storytelling (just making everything bigger and better).

 It successfully made Star Wars relavent again. That alone deserves three stars by itself. the other two and a half are for the amazing effects and well realized characters with great acting to boot. The only thing stopping me from giving it the full five is how it does feel kind of like a retelling of the original film but contrary to popular belief that isn't a horrible thing. Creed did that to great effect and Frozen is the same movie as the Lion King and all of those films had critical acclaim and have been nominated for (and even won) Academy Awards and Golden Globes. Also there were some hiccups in the effects that I noticed especially the rathtars. Those had no excuse to look that bad especially since the same parent company released The Jungle Book a few months later.

 GREG: (Greg Smith Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond VA) Well Scott let s review the movie that was 30 years in the making.<br><br>SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison Professor of Psychology University of Richmond) It was indeed a long time ago in a galaxy not so far away. Let s recap.<br><br>GREG: We re introduced to Rey (Daisy Ridley) a young woman who lives on the dusty planet of Jakka. She makes her living such as it is by scavenging parts from the deserted ships of the Empire. It s been 30 years since the Rebellion defeated the Empire which has been replaced by the First Order. Things are getting slim when she saves a small robot BB-8 from being disassembled for parts. It s not long before she encounters young Finn (John Boyega) a former stormtrooper of the First Order. Together they learn that BB-8 has a map to the legendary Luke Skywalker and needs to be returned to the Rebel base.<br><br>SCOTT: Soon after Rey and Finn team up they are aggressively pursued by a squadron of First Order stormtroopers. As fate would have it the pair make their escape in a discarded old ship called the Millennium Falcon. Rey and Finn encounter the original owners of the ship who of course are Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo). We then get the backstory of how Luke Skywalker tried to rebuild the Jedi Order but was thwarted by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) a former Jedi who fell into the dark side. Rey and Finn then spend the rest of the movie trying to deliver the map to the leaders of the resistance.<br><br>GREG: Scott it s deja vu all over again. Star Wars: The Force Awakens (Episode VII) is merely a repackaging of Episodes IV V and VI. Just as in A New Hope we meet a young person who befriends a droid with a message to be delivered to the Rebels. This young person is unaware that they can command the powers of The Force and and must help their new friends blow up a gigantic planet-killing weapon. While from a technical point of view SW:TFA is a stunning film to watch it is all too familiar territory. JJ Abrams has done with Star Wars as he did with Star Trek - he s just replaying the best hits of the originals. I was less than impressed.<br><br>SCOTT: The build-up for this film was enormous and expectations were beyond the stratosphere. As for the final product -- how could we expect anything different? JJ Abrams plays it safe by recycling old ideas and characters which he had to do to please a fan-base that would not tolerate much deviation from the mega-successful formula. At the same time Abrams introduces several new characters who can carry the mantle for the next several installments of the franchise. With these new heroes not everything is the same -- just similar. As it turns out our two heroic newcomers Rey and Finn are outstanding characters whom we grow to love and enjoy rooting for soon after meeting them. Both these characters are cut from that familiar Star Wars heroic cloth -- they come from humble origins and are oblivious to their special pedigree. As these characters are tested they begin to slowly transform into the greatness that was always there beneath the surface. No movie franchise does a better job than Star Wars at developing characters with this sort of amnesia about their true identities. It s done with great effectiveness in this installment of Star Wars.<br><br>GREG: Well you re right about that Scott. Rey is in every way a classic hero. She starts out alone and yearning for her parents to return. By the end of the film she has found a new home and a new belonging. Her growth from a scavenger to a warrior is heartening. She befriends Finn who literally has no identity. He takes on the ramant of a Resistance fighter and grows into it. Like Rey he is alone at the start of the film (despite being surrounded by a horde of look-alike Stormtroopers). But by the end he also has found a new home. I like these newcomers very much and I look forward to their journey forth in this new series. The villains in this story are also familiar. Kylo Ren is pretty much a Darth Vader wannabe. He uses the Dark Side and reports to an all powerful master. This is the same Mastermind/Henchman pattern we saw in Episodes IV-VI. Harrison Ford nearly steals the show as an aging Han Solo. He delivers a great performance of the swashbuckling hero we knew in the earlier films. And in a twist it is Han who is the father of Kylo Ren - echoing the Darth Vader/Luke Skywalker relationship. Carrie Fisher is all grown up and in charge as General Leia Organa. Her interactions with Ford are a bit stilted and expositiony. But she is not the only woman in the galaxy as was true of the last incarnation. Aside from Rey we also have a Stormtrooper leader and several X-Wing fighters who are of the feminine persuasion. It s a good crop of side characters.<br><br>SCOTT: Yes there s much to like about this incarnation of Star Wars. Our two new young heroes show some demographic diversity. How refreshing it is to see non-Whites and non-males dominate the heroic landscape. Yet the movie remains faithful to the classic elements of the hero s journey. Rey and Finn both undergo transformations of the head heart and identity. They both have important mentor figures to guide them. Luke Skywalker for example is a mentor from afar whose legacy has been mythologized by the resistance. Rey has her own Yoda a wonderfully wiseand exotic female alien named Maz Kanata (Lupita Nyongo). The villains are a multi-layered version of the mastermind-henchman template that we discuss in our most recent book Reel Heroes &amp Villains. Usually this template features a single evil mastermind who uses henchmen and minions to do his or her dirty work. In this movie we see several layers of the villainous onion starting with a horrid Supreme Leader who really could benefit from a trip to Bath &amp Body Works. Beneath this Supreme Leader are several mid-managers of evil such as Kylo Ren each of whom order their assigned Stormtroopers to carry out specific evil deeds. I can t emphasize enough this film s use of the classic hero journey in mythology. George Lucas himself made much of his use of Joseph Campbell s analysis of mythic symbols images and plot points. Here Abrams carries on the tradition. For example some key scenes in this movie take place in the forest which is always a symbol of the unknown dangerous and volatile forces lurking within our unconscious. There is also a strong family structure that characterizes the ensembles of both the heroes and the villains. These strong family roles run deep in fairy tales and legends throughout the ages. Finally the theme of redemption courses through this film s veins. Heroes like Finn set out to turn their wrongs into rights and villains like Kylo Ren are given the opportunity and fail -- for now at least.<br><br>GREG: Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a technically exciting film with a familiar story arc. While it will win no awards for originality it should win awards for special effects. It will certainly win awards at the box office for the records it will break. While I enjoyed myself there is nothing that will entice me to keep coming back. I am tempted to award only three Reels but that s a score I use for the average film-going experience. SW:TFA is well above average but lacks anything new. I give it 4 out of 5 Reels. The heroes in this film are plenty. We re reminded of the heroes gone by and introduced to new ones as well. Rey and Finn work well together as newcomers but neither is naive. Each has street smarts from their own worlds. And they both grew in their roles. It was good to get caught up with Han Chewie and Leia. As with other aging heroes we see that the destination for the hero is to become a mentor. And the old guard did not disappoint. I give the heroes in this film 4 out of 5 Heroes. The secondary characters were also very good. Kylo Ren as the fallen hero-come-villain fits nicely into the Villain s Journey that we outlined in our last book. He is subservient to a (nearly) hidden mastermind. BB8 as the dutiful and emotic sidekick played its role well - although I m confused as to how everyone understood BB8 s beeps-and-boops but no one understands R2D2 but C3PO (who also made a nice pair of cameos). I give the secondary characters 4 out of 5 Cast points. Movie: Cast: Heroes:<br><br>SCOTT: The Force Awakens definitely kept me awake and is a box office force to be reckoned with. But does it deliver the goods? Mostly yes in a play-it-safe kind of way. Fans of Star Wars will be elated while fans of outstanding movies will have more muted praise. JJ Abrams does his usual excellent job he injects the Star Wars universe with new interesting heroes technical marvels and a lot of clever one-liners. But there isn t a whole lot of new ground broken here. I m with you Greg in awarding this movie 4 Reels out of 5. The characters of Rey and Finn in this film are an impressive pair of buddy heroes. They follow the usual buddy-hero pattern of distrusting and disliking each other at first but after learning they have the same goals they develop an unshakable bond. They also help each other transform and evolve into heroically courageous individuals. All the elements of the hero s journey stand out in bold relief and it is refreshing that the filmmakers dared to embrace diversity in their casting of this duo. I m happy to award Rey and Finn a full 5 out of 5 Heroes. The remaining characters all did their jobs in superb fashion. I agree with you Greg that Harrison Ford handled his geezerly role with both charm and alacrity. All the secondary heroes and villains were fun to root for and to despise. The treachery of Kylo Ren was somewhat routine and predictable and the Star Wars robots whom I ve never been fond of at all were grating to me. Still the cast did a great job overall and so I also award them 4 out of 5 cast points. Movie: Cast: Heroes:, 4.0,  Reel H, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976625758/, August 19 2017, N/A
 Playing it safe with a lot of familiar elements JJ Abrams obviously didn't want to take a lot of risks here but what he has done is revive the franchise and brought it back to something that is not only entertaining but feels like it's reconnected to its roots. The cast wasn't half bad either with all those recognisable faces as well as new ones played by Ridley Boyega and Isaac. Something could be said for the rather strange baddie Kylo Ren whose personality seems to be at odds with everything that a powerful menacing villain should be -- there is some reasoning behind that depiction but I don't know that it makes a difference to how impotent he seems when compared with iconic villains such as Darth Vader.<br><br>Nevertheless it's a good start to a reboot and a pretty fun one too.

 For someone who grew up with Star Wars and watched the old trilogy more than 500 times I was pretty excited to see Star Wars The Force Awakens at his release. I must admit that at my first viewing of the film I was positively amazed because as a Star Wars fan it was nice to watch a new Star Wars movie 10 years after the release of Revenge of the Sith back in 2005. But with a little recoil I found that The Force Awakens wasn't as amazing as I thought. <br><br>Here are certain points that bug me in the movie. Careful SPOILERS ahead:<br><br>- First at all the title. I hate it! It is as vague as "The Phantom Menace". At least "Heir to the Force" or "Remnants of the Empire" sound more epic and make more sense.<br>- Let's admit it the story was greatly inspired by "A New Hope" if not saying a copy-paste. Actually the story that I would have love to see was the one that Lucas had already created or at least the one they tell us in the film about Ben's betrayal to the dark side. I understand that it would been some kind of copy-paste of Revenge of the Sith but at least Mark Hamill would have been more present in the movie.<br>- John Williams' score is almost non-existent.<br>- I hate that Rey can fly a ship even if she haven't pilot one before that she can understand the languages of every species and droids and that she knows how to use the Force so easily. That's too much even for a Jedi.<br>- I think that the cliffhanger should have been the reveal of Kylo Ren as Han &amp Leia's son and it should have been done right before Han's death not earlier in the film. I greatly recommend you to watch DigModiFicaTion's fan edit "Heir to the Force" because it has this cliffhanger.<br>- Why does Kylo Ren's true name is Ben? As we know Leia didn't ever met Ben and Han didn't really care about him. So why the hell are calling your son with the name of someone that you don't know?<br>- Why the First Order's stormtroopers are still called stormtroopers if it isn't the Empire who rules the galaxy anymore? In the prequels they were known as clonetroopers stormtroopers in the originals so why stormtroopers again in the sequels?<br>- I hate that we don't see any familiar aliens race in the movie (except of Ackbar). No Twi-leks no Jawas no Devaronians no Ugnaughts no Duros no Biths no Rodians etc. <br>- Why BB-8? Why using a new droid? R2-D2 and C-3PO are THE droids of Star Wars since Episode 1 so why replacing them? I liked the idea of C-3PO's red arm but they removed it at the end :(<br>- Why Poe immediately trusts Finn when this one helps him to escape? That doesn't make any sense! I mean does Poe the best pilot of the Resisitance but also a total idiot? At least it would have been excellent to learn at the end that Finn was actually a spy charged to inflitrate the Resistance from inside. THAT would have been awesome and THAT would also been a damn good cliffhanger!<br>- I also hate how the ending was made. I think the movie should have ended with the Millenium Falcon leaving the Resistance and entering into hyperspace. No Luke at all. Just knowing that the Resistance learned his location is enough. Also what I hate more about the ending is the camera rotating shot. WTF? There is no shot like this in any other Star Wars movies.<br><br>I know that I'm not the only one who like to bash against the movie but all I want to say is that Disney could have done so much better with this franchise in their pockets. Star Wars universe is so huge and rich with so many awesome story possibilities that it is a shame to watch something like "The Force Awakens". At least Lucas knew his stuff.

 Shamelessly rehashes "A New Hope" likely because the writers were so busy making a political point they forgot to write a script. The actual story seems to take a back seat to the somewhat forced diversity vs lack thereof scenareo being presented and according to the writers that was actually intentional (to lazy to cite if you give a crap find the quote or take with a grain of salt there's definitely pleanty of that to go around in this review). Also where the story was original it was trash and made critical mistakes such as revealing the antagonist to be essentially an emo kid (a badass one I'll admit) really early and relying on the age old crutch of family reveals and 'who's related to whom!?!' suspense that was very well used in the originals but now feels awkward and cliche. Toss in the fact that Disney (note that I'm very biased against Disney) puts more effort into pushing merchandise than developing dynamic characters (plush bb8/ baby Groot anyone?) resulting in the classic one dimensional cartoonish/ childish characters Disney is infamous for and you have yourself a perfect recipe for a shallow politically charged money grab.

 This film is what I think will be the new Phantom Menace. The critics and audience are praising it like crazy but several years from now when people are no longer blinded by hype I think they will be really disappointed in this movie. People are saying that the film's plot is a carbon copy of A New Hope. And those people are 100% right. This flick's story is identical! You have a droid carrying important plans for a big space station that can destroy planets which must get back to the Rebels (or in this case Resistance) before the space station destroys them. The way the Rebels destroy the space station is by flying down a trench and firing a torpedo to the core which makes the whole thing blow up. Not to mention Jakku is a clone of Tatooine and Starkiller Base (AKA Death Star III) is a clone of Hoth. The characters are awful too. Rey is perfect. Seriously I challenge you to find just ONE mistake that she makes in this film. We related to Luke because he was human and messed up. He wasn't perfect. In Episode V he totally failed at the cave ignored Yoda's advice and went to go fight Vader which ultimately cost him his hand. Another thing that bugs me is how quickly Rey picks up the Force. It took Luke years to master it and now you're telling me Rey can perform a Jedi Mind Trick in 20 seconds. Are you serious? Finn is clearly there for comic relief and to occasionally move the plot along. Poe is another perfect character. The only good new character was Kylo Ren. He was sort of a mix between Anakin Skywalker when he was about to become a Sith and Darth Vader. He was menacing and showed HE WAS HUMAN. When his officers failed him he got angry. He showed emotion unlike the other bland characters. Another element of this film that got on my nerves was how Kylo Ren who has been trained for years by Luke Skywalker and Snoke was taken down by a stormtrooper. Get out. Speaking of Snoke the CGI that JJ Abrams used for him was absolutely horrific. The CGI that Abrams used in general was horrific. Everything looked clean and sterile. It lacked humanity. Why? Because it was all done on green screen. Overall Episode VII is a colossal disappointment and I really do wish they had never even made it. I would even go so far as to say the prequels were better than this because at least George Lucas tried to give us something new. Would not recommend at all. Only reason I'm giving 1.5 stars is because of Kylo Ren., 1.5,  Drew%20 B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976545203/, July 16 2017, N/A
 1. Favorite movie of 2015 &amp 2016, 5.0,  Ivan V, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976184209/, July 15 2017, N/A
 Well...Abrams has done it again. The hopes of a generation of geeks was in his hands and he has not dissapointed. The execution is not completely flawless...but who cares its Star Wars and Force Awakens is undeniably awesome.<br>The plot does feel a little like a rehash of A New Hope but I see this as a homage rather than a cop out. Great to see old favs coming back and there are nice subtle nods to episodes 4-6 throughout particularly in the dialogue. On that point the writing is very good and the interaction between the characters is interesting and at times pretty funny. This humour works well and doesn't detract or make light of a dire situation.<br>I will not put any spoilers in here..but 'the thing' (as it will henceforth be known) is at first surprising but then fairly obvious in retrospect. In a way I am happy it has gone that way it's the only way it could.<br>JJ's use of practical effects works wonders on this film. Right from the very first trailer I knew I was gonna like the style. The gritty realism of the sets locations and effects bring the film closer to 'reality' (all be it in a galaxy far far away) and is welcome shift away from the CGI heavy worlds of the Lucas prequels. When CGI is used it is necessary and therefore makes the more spectacular events that much more impressive.<br>Kylo Ren is an excellent villain with an interesting twist on the 'pull of the force' and his choices over the course of the film. Very well handled by Adam Driver. <br>Ridley and Boyega are great too and endlessly likable. The insight into the world of the Stormtrooper is briefly intriguing and the childish innocence of Finn's (Boyega) portrayal works a treat. As a man thrust into the real world he knows nothing about we as an audience truly route for him. Likewise that of Rey (Ridley) and her journey.<br>This film is just the right mix of the old and the new and I throughly enjoyed it. Can't wait for what's to come..., ni,  Michael P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/484289161/, July 15 2017, N/A
 Just a copy of a new hope you can see it by visuals dialogue characters locations and the character's missions. Some things they copied:<br><br>-another death star<br>-another tatooine <br>-another empire <br>-another rebellion <br>-another demonstration of what the superweapon can do<br>-same spacecrafts<br>-another tatooine looking planet containing our protagonist <br>and more! <br><br>The characters had some likable qualities but the protagonist Rey was clearly a Mary Sue. she had no flaws and required no training for the force., 2.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976543587/, July 15 2017, N/A

 This is just another movie which is suffering from "Fast and Furious" syndrome. You don't really need a plot or a story of any kind. As long as you have mindless action for no reason and lots of flashy bits then the masses will be entertained like mindless children. I am a life long Star Wars fan and I when I saw this movie it made me hate the original movies. Hell even John Williams knew the movie sucked which is reflected in the soundtrack. Everything that the Rebels accomplished in the original trilogy was wasted. It meant absolutely nothing because in J.J. Abrams movie nothing is different. Nothing has changed. Luke should have rebuilt the Jedi order by now but after one failure he apparently says "Screw it! I'm done!" The only reason this garbage pile of a film got so many good ratings on sites like Rotten Tomatoes is due to the fact that Disney hyped it up as much as they could precisely to do that - to have all the casuals and Pro-Disney fanboy drones sit there drooling while they "oohed and aahed!" at all the new &amp shiny CGI with the SW logo lazily slapped on it. Many casuals and Pro-Disney fanboys like to say "B-b-but it got good ratings on RT so it's a good movie!" yet they ignore the fact that public opinion of this film has changed from "all-positive" to mostly mixed or bad opinions now. They conveniently like to pretend that everyone still feels the same about this film when in reality most people have woken up from their hype-induced coma and are now seeing this film for what it really is - a poor man's watered down rehash of 'A New Hope' with scattered bits of the other OT films scattered in there and bits and pieces from the EU novels sprinkled on top to fool all the casuals and fanboys into believing that it was "new &amp original" material.? There are too many "fans" for a Star Wars sequel to fail. Fans will blindly defend their brands and like Stockholm Syndrome will continue defending them when exposed to the truth. Disney knew this going into the deal. And worst of all the "geeks" will compulsively buy anything licensed with their brand. So you can either have a new movie without a geek fan base to reap money off or buy a huge fan base to exploit and that's what Disney did. They saw The Hunger Games female action chick trend and used Star Wars as their Hunger Games clone.? Massive plot holes large enough to hide an aircraft carrier poor script writing painfully repetitive plot unfunny comedic moments... The list goes on and on. The difference between me and other people who've said the same thing is I won't be watching Episodes 8 910 where the majority of you will still give Disney your money.? To be honest I would rather watch a Jar Jar Binks movie directed by George Lucas than to see another J.J.Abrams monstrosity.?, 1.0,  Georg P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976536471/, July 13 2017, N/A

 I give it One star for being Star Wars and a half star for some effort in the cast. However it gets nothing more than that for being a glorified left wing extremist propaganda film that does nothing but destroy so much history to the franchise. You have the Mary Sue 10 second God Mode Rey Finn the Friend Zoned black guy (his actor played him very well though) somehow able to use a lightsaber without any prior training you have Poe....oh yeah he was there for that one scene.....oh and like the end of the movie...yeah go Poe aka guy we don't know. Phasma! Yeah! Lets build up a character for like 2 insignificant themes and make her into a bad rehashed joke for the sake of Nostalgia! Woot! Then you have Professor Snape jr over here like bruh ain't you supposed to be in Harry Potter? And then you got the has-beens that are no longer relevant to the story. Then last scene hey Luke!

 It's tough for me to give this movie a fair and impartial review as I am such a superfan of the originals and therefore not impartial. But I'm gonna give it a shot. Here goes! .... I liked it. I'm not over the moon about it but I liked it. This film is a whole lot of fun and captures the spirit of the original trilogy which is all anyone can ask for. Regardless I still wanted more. And not just because I'm a superfan but because this film is so obviously a rehash of the first movie (A New Hope). Same plot same characters (in different versions) even the same sequences. It's clear the parallels were intentional but I found the choice to be uninspired. Seriously guys this is the THIRD TIME we've seen this exact fighter pilot climax in a Star Wars movie and it was a lazy choice the second time around. I just would have liked something new. However the movie still manages to be successful because of the characters which are well developed and acted and you are with them all the way. The film has several key storylines but the central protagonist is Daisy Ridley's Rey who is a worthy addition to the canon of Star Wars heroes. She brings the heart of the movie AND can hold her own in a fight. Sit down Katniss Everdeen there is a new badass chick in town! The script is well written despite some cheesy dialogue and it's often funny - sometimes intentionally and sometimes not (tip: watch BB8 in the background he is almost always doing something funny). It's also very well directed JJ Abrams has "brought balance" to the movie (heh heh) in its pacing tone and structure - there is a good balance between the dazzling action scenes and the quiet character-driven scenes as well as between the old school and new school plot lines. This episode has restored the magic of the original trilogy and successfully rebooted the franchise for the next generation.

 Bassed upon weakly designed heroes pretending to get credibility under the wave of hipster reboots Star Wars Episode 7 is by far the worst way in which the return of the franchise could have ever managed to insult a cult movie.<br><br>Not only that it lacked imagination on every aspect (villains heroes plot characters in general) but it was so dull that even the fact of belonging to mighty Star Wars franchise wasn't enough to make it remotely acceptable.<br><br>Seriously man if you were going to make such a bad movie it would have been better not to even try it.

 I had my doubts when George Lucas sold his soul to the mouse but after watching this I am glad he did. Bringing on JJ Abrams was the first thing they did right. It seems he took all of the positives from the 6 previous films and worked them seamlessly together into beautiful work of Star Wars art. To do this you have to really understand the subject matter and JJ was clearly up to the task. He also was wise to leave out what did not work from episodes 1-3. The storyline was good the acting solid and the special effects great as would be expected. The only critique I had would be that the plot too closely resembled episode 4 at times. The film successfully passes the torch from the old cast of characters to the new much as JJ did with Star Trek. I like the way the franchise is going and the future is light again as opposed to becoming ever darker after the last trilogy. I am still amazed at the mastery of John Williams as I continued to hear the theme for the character Rey long afterwards in my mind. His music really sets the tone and is still a core element to the success of the series. If you like a fast paced action thriller with a fairly concise ending immersion into a sci-fi universe well done star wars genre great special effects a great musical score. and good acting to go with it then I highly recommend this film. I watched it 4x., 5.0,  Gregory S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/941175005/, May 30 2017, N/A

I never noticed <br>The Force Awakens being a remake of A New Hope. The whole plot is the mystery of Luke Skywalker!!!

 'The Force Awakens' is a very lazy movie that treats it's audience like mindless drones who'll eat up anything labeled 'Star Wars'. This is a remake of 'A New Hope' which isn't a great movie in and of itself but much better than this. We are introduced to three new protagonists named Rey Finn and Poe. Rey is somehow able to wield the powers of the Force to near perfection in an extremely limited amount of time. You've already got an inherent problem with your movie if your protagonist is too powerful. That said Daisy Ridley does play the part well and there is a particularly entertaining scene where she mind-controls a Stormtrooper. Finn had the potential to be interesting. He is a runaway Stormtrooper suffering from PTSD. An interesting idea but doesn't really amount to anything in execution. And Poe should've remained a one off character who died after the first 20 minutes or so. If you are a fan of the original trilogy prepare to be pissed off at what they do with the legacy characters. JJ Abrams is good at crafting visually impressive films ('The Force Awakens' is visually stunning) but in terms of narrative he blew it with this film., 2.5,  Billy G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976361279/, May 25 2017, N/A

 The present day socio-political climate seeps its way into Star Wars and ruins a decent franchise by forcing an ideology down your throat. Almost nothing is explained. There is no political dialogue present in the rest of the saga and the characters are one dimensional and unbelievable. The people that wrote and directed this are not Star Wars fans. The only redeeming part of the movie is the visuals. It is a gorgeous movie with a lot of eye candy. Other than that I wish that they would stop making Star Wars movies.

 A surprisingly delightful new saga in the Star Wars series catching up as it does 30 years after the rebels defeated the dark side in 'Return Of the Jedi'. The most noticeable change in tone from the self-reverential prequel trilogy last decade is the welcome injection of humour and old faces (Harrison Ford Carrie Fisher and Mark Hammil) blending with a younger cast of equally strong performers (Daisy Ridley John Boyega and a charismatic but under-used Oscar Isaac). Kylo Ren is the bad guy in this universe played by Adam Driver he's a sinister emo Darth Vader- wannabe who as we discover even prays to the dark lord's melted helmet- the guy clearly has some daddy issues but that would be revealing too much about the plot for those who are yet to see it! Despite the strength of the cast it is Harrison Ford's (30 million dollar) return to the role of Han Solo that gives the film a lot of its enjoyment and warm nostalgia. It is also the guiltiest of pleasures seeing Han back in the cockpit of the Millenium Falcon with Chewbacca! Ford actually turns in one of his most entertaining performances in years and his scenes with Carrie Fisher also have a sentimental spark about them. Now as for Luke the dark side are trying to find out where he is (filmgoers too!) but enough of that I think he may be a more central part of the next installment!..., 3.5,  Adam T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/807944467/, April 3 2017, N/A
 This movie had one job: make Star Wars feel like Star Wars again. It did it's job well. After what the Star Wars prequels put fans through this movie is a breath of fresh air.

 Never have I watched Star Wars and wanted to turn off the movie in the first 20 minutes. That was until I watched this unmitigated DISASTER of a film. Even in the prequels this franchise never veered so far from what it was. This film was nothing more than Disney saying "Look look look you understood that reference give us money" while lowkey remaking A New Hope. How ANYBODY can defend this movie with a straight face is far FAR beyond me. I'd give this movie zero stars but well at least Harrison Ford was good playing Han Solo as he always is course they kill Han so theres insult to injury after 2 hours of a crappy Star Wars movie.

 This is a movie that definitely falls into the guilty pleasure category. On one hand the movie plays like a greatest hits of the original trilogy (with some familiar locations and familiar looking characters) and some very obvious plot holes big enough to get the Death Star through on the other hand Force Awakes introduces us to some great new characters -Rey Finn and Poe- that were well developed and brought new life to the series.

 The Force Awakens is a rousing spectacle coming-of-age story directed by JJ Abrams starring Harrison Ford Carrie Fisher and Daisy Ridley. A must-see for Star Wars fans and an excellent movie on its own. Technical-wise it is the best Star Wars movie with emphasis on more practical effects rather than CGI. The sound and music is excellent setting the mood uplifting melancholic sad spirited...thanks to John Williams. The acting is very good loads better than the prequels especially Ford who makes a heartfelt return as the lovable rogue Han Solo and Ridley as the new heroine Rey (a strong woman which is sorely needed in movies these days) and Adam Driver as the villainous Kylo Ren. The action sequences are very good especially the TIE fighters and X-Wings' dogfights. But there is not much lightsaber duels as I would have liked. The plot is relatively good with some good twists and excellent pacing it will never bore you. But the plot might not be groundbreaking if you are familiar with Star War's lore/films you will recognize some familiar beats. And some plot threads are unfinished most likely will be completed in Star Wars episodes 8 and 9. I cried I cheered I was uplifted. Can't wait to see where Rey's life will be next. A solid A grade.

 The Force Awakens is a very good film. I was so happy with the way it turned out. I'm going to first talk about the characters because that's where this movie really shines. These new characters are great. You're rooting for them the whole time because they are just so likable. That's what Rogue One did wrong there were no good or likable characters. And there was some great dialogue between the characters. We have some great scenes of them just talking nothing else. Not only do we connect with them so do they with each other. It makes them feel like real people and that's why this movie doesn't absolutely suck. The score is also incredible. I'm almost sure Rey's Theme will become one of the iconic Star Wars pieces in the future like most of the songs in the original trilogy and some from the prequels did. But it has one huge flaw. And it is the plot is almost identical to A New Hope and it is so apparent. Even my younger sister who's in third grade could point out where it was similar. And the whole map situation was really stupid. The Resistance doesn't need the whole map because they already have the location. That's what keeps this movie from being a masterpiece. The Force Awakens sets up new movies to come while introducing fun and convincing new characters. It has fantastic action and great visuals. It gets a 8/10., 4.0,  Jeje W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/975762931/, April 14 2017, N/A

 Star Wars: The Force Awakens<br>01/05/2016<br> "The Force Awakens" is quite the disappointment in my eyes. I've seen "The Force Awakens" twice and I didn't like it either time that I saw it. Actually I've already seen this movie way before it came out but I liked it way better when it was called "Star Wars: A New Hope."<br> When you look really closely at the plot of "The Force Awakens" you'll notice that it has pretty much the exact same plot as the very first Star Wars except on steroids. The Empire (or in this case The First Order) is looking for some droids. And they have a humongous death star that the Rebellion (or in this case the resistance) needed to destroy or else they would be destroyed. They say that the death star was tiny in comparison to this new one. And I was pretty underwhelmed by this new one. Bigger is not better.<br> The action scenes were annoying. I didn't like the lightsaber duels the battles between the troopers and the rebellion soldiers and I didn't like the Starfighter scenes. Because I just felt so much like they were trying to revitalize Star Wars with a bunch of fight scenes that were meant to be entertaining but what J.J. doesn't understand is that Star Wars has no need to be revitalized.<br>I was really disappointed by "The Force Awakens" because I thought that I was really going to like it. I was a fan of the J.J. Abrams version of the first "Star Trek" movie. Going in to see the "Star Trek" movie I didn't know anything about it and J.J. was very kind to the people who had never seen "Star Trek" before. I remember talking with one of my best friends about J.J. as a director and he told me that J.J. is a director that just crafts movies to be enjoyed by a wide range of audiences instead of being a director that makes movies that aren't meant to be liked by everyone. <br>I'm starting to understand what my friend meant by that because I felt that every action scene in "The Force Awakens" was crafted with an appeal that seemed like it was meant to please a very general sense of action that I desire in certain movies. For instance I didn't like the scene with the stormtrooper wielding that riot baton. Because all I thought to myself was: "That's kind of stupid." Besides we've already seen weapons that can match the power of a lightsaber. Admittedly those weapons were in the prequels but regardless those types of weapons have existed long before that stupid riot baton.<br> And instead of me liking the action scenes in "The Force Awakens" the action scenes did the exact opposite of what they were meant to do and just pushed me further away as a fan of "Star Wars" as a franchise. And now I'm just wishing for the old movies again.<br> I'm sure that when I was a kid I've seen every single one of the original "Star Wars" movies 50 times each at the very least and I'm sure it's got to be more than that because I feel like I have those movies memorized now. But I've only seen "The Force Awakens" twice and I have absolutely no desire to see it a third time. And I didn't like it either one of the times I saw it because it just didn't feel like Star Wars to me and it didn't have the same magic as the original movies. Andrew O'herir said something that I agree with 100 percent: "...Abrams has grander ambitions than a Michael Bay-style cash grab. His mission is to build a new 'Star Wars' franchise on top of the old one and the ultimate success of that venture will largely depend on how the series' millions of fans react to the fact that he hasn't just made a movie fueled by nostalgia or a movie full of mythic echoes. He's made a movie they've already seen a simulacrum of something that was already a simulacrum of something else." And you know what I think that Mr. O'herir is absolutely right. This new "Star Wars" movie is just a rehashed movie that's not entirely different but not entirely the same as the very first Star Wars movie. I was talking to another friend of mine about "The Force Awakens" now my friend actually liked the movie but he said and I quote: "I felt that there was a little too much homage paid to the originals." That was definitely true because there were so many lines throughout the movie that were said in reference to the first movie and most of it was said by Han Solo. He even repeats one of his old lines from the first movie: "I've got a bad feeling about this." And this Star Wars doesn't add anything new to the series other than new heroes new villains and nothing else. Yeah you could say that the Stormtrooper helmets are more streamline C-3PO has a new red arm R2-D2's been replaced by the newer and cuter droid BB-8 and there's a lightsaber fashioned to be more like a claymore and now Star Wars has fancy CGI to accompany this new addition to the franchise. I know that J.J. was trying to add substance to the story but those moments felt forced and were blotted out by all the action scenes that were underwhelming and just not that entertaining. I mean the scene where we see Rey adding a new mark to the number of days that she's been on Jakku just didn't seem to add anything. Or the part where Finn was getting sick from the things he saw when the First Order was killing innocent villagers. It just didn't add anything for me.<br> "The Force Awakens" doesn't deserve its' place in the Star Wars universe. I know there are going to be a lot of fans who will be jumping down my throat but you know what I don't care. "The Force Awakens" is overrated. It had its' moments but not very many. And by the way Daisy Ridley is a terrible actress who has a hot body and nothing else. She brings nothing to the table of Star Wars and should be replaced by a chick who actually knows how to act.<br>"Star Wars: The Force Awakens" gets: 1.5 out of 5.0, 1.5,  Zachary C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976253911/, April 10 2017, N/A

 Everything that makes us love star wars is brought to the big screen here in a supremely done movie. <br>J.J Abrams shows why he is such a fine director with a blend of action story and most importantly staying true to the Star Wars franchise.<br><br>He did not go over the top with CGI and truly kept in tune with the old movies.<br>It felt like I was watching an old Star Wars at times.<br>What was also really cool is how the characters from the old films made their presence known. Back is Solo Leia 3PO Chewy and others.<br><br>We get a couple new villains who are both pretty exceptional.<br>Kylo Ren was really good even though I thought he lost some of his menacing features as the movie went on.<br>It is just a perfect continuation of the previous films in the way it feels like a Star Wars film. That is tough to do given how crazy high the expectations were going into this movie. <br>Finally I want to give a major hats off to Daisy Ridley. She really carried this film in a lot of the scenes. Her acting chops were crisp and she had a cuteness to her that blended well with her jedi abilities. We know a little about her but that is what added to her character. Not knowing her whole story added to the intrigue.<br>Very good stuff and I cannot wait for the rest of the series to play out., 4.5,  Tyler S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/911013219/, April 8 2017, N/A

 From the very day J. J. Abrams was announced as the director of Star Wars episode 8 I had no doubt in my mind that this film would be just as successful if not more successful than the original trilogy (episodes 4-6). <br><br>Sure there have been some negative comments made with regards to the film being all to similar to that of Episode 3 I need not to delve to far into this but all I am gonna say what is commonly known to most "History repeats itself". <br><br>Regardless of the familiarities Star Wars: The Force Awakens fulfilled every hope and aspiration I had in mind. Like all good movies should it kept me entertained throughout with an ideal balance of spectacular real and CG effects and an awesome cast of both new and familiar actors.

 The main character Rey is way too perfect good at everything and worst of all understands how to use the force within seconds without ANY training. How does she even know about the jedi mind trick? How could she use the force on the lightsaber like that in the final fight? It's all so unimmersive and cheap. Finn also makes no sense as a character. Why did he suddenly defect from the First Order? The movie even makes it a point to tell the audience this was his first act of disobedience. Why? Wouldn't it have made more sense if he was a problem child? How does someone who's been in the First Order their entire life have a sense of humor like that too? The story layout is also way too similar to Episode IV as many others have pointed out already. This movie just kind of screams "fan service" to me. Made for people to go "oh yeah look guys it's Star Wars!!"

 So we pretend that the critics aren't paid off or at least brown nosing to someone in the industry. When you watch this movie again... and then actually think about the plot holes you start getting somewhere. But it doesn't really sink in until you realize... J.J. didn't try at all... he just plopped in another Death Star another empire and for what reason? They should have disbanded. That prequel book was shit and so is this movie. They just wanted fresh actors... fan service... money... and more movies more money. The best thing in the movie was ren stopping a blaster bolt. Everything.... everything else sucked. Can't believe they pay these brain dead loafs to write story.

 The long-awaited film Star Wars: VII The Force Awakens was finally released on December 18 2015 and it was a film to be remembered. One of the most memorable things about the movie for me was the main villain Kylo Ren who was portrayed by the actor Adam Driver. When Kylo Ren was first introduced he looked menacing but as the movie progressed we got to see the character in a different light. Kylo Ren wants to become more powerful than his grandfather Darth Vader but in the movie we can see him struggling with the power of the light and dark side of the force. He searches for a way to become more power with the dark side by hunting down Luke Skywalker to supposedly end the last jedi but when he discovers Rey's ability to use the force he becomes afraid which leads him to try and persuade her to the dark side but fails with Rey leaving Kylo Ren with a nasty lightsaber wound across his face. Kylo Ren didn't seem to be fully trained by his Supreme Leader which left him vulnerable and incompetent throughout the entire movie but that leaves us wondering what will become of him in the next film., 4.0,  Aaron C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976302659/, April 26 2017, N/A

 The Force Awakens isn't going to win many points for originality but putting flagrant copy-pastes from A New Hope aside the seventh outing in the Star Wars saga is an exceptionally well-executed revitalization of the franchise that successfully captures the look and feel of the original trilogy far better than the prequels did. Although the overarching plot should have brought something newer to the table the film manages to redeem itself through the characters whose personal journeys keep the story feeling fresh among otherwise deeply familiar territory. With good steady pacing fun new characters and dazzling action sequences episode 7 earns its place in the Star Wars canon but in order for the new trilogy to maintain its momentum it can't keep relying on reliving past glories., 4.0,  Phil S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976258874/, April 24 2017, N/A
 AWESOME!!! Now THIS is the new Star Wars movie I've been waiting all these years the next TRUE Star Wars story not those pretentious prequel crap! Seeing again the classic characters of Han Solo and Princess Leia was such a thrill and not only that but having legendary Harrison Ford return as Han in not just a short cameo (like a certain Jedi) but as the front and center of this new chapter was pure mindblowing bliss. The new characters were not bad either I especially liked the colorful sometimes hilarious character of Finn. The central lead of this trilogy the mysterious Rey was good too though in my opinion she's not as endearing or instantly relatable as the young Luke of old days. But the most interesting and promising new character is without a doubt Kylo Ren aka Ben Solo Han &amp Leia's estranged son and the new villain who's started as just another evil Darth Vader copycat but turned out to be much more and hopefully will become so much more in the upcoming episodes as well. I'm really looking forward to the development of the relationship between him and Rey. The only thing that slightly irritated me was at times its having too much similarities with the basic plotline of A New Hope (stolen Death Star plans the Empire is seeking = = map of Luke's whereabouts the First Order is seeking that hidden inside R2D2 = = hidden inside BB8 Luke = = Rey Planet Tattooine = = Planet Jakku Darth Vader = = Kylo Ren the Emperor = = Supreme Leader Snoke Death Star = = Starkiller base death of Obi Wan by the hands of his apprentice Vader = = death of Han Solo by the hands of his son most of the third act and so on). Nonetheless what always matter are all the things in-between and in that regard this is an exceptionally well-made positively thrilling suspenseful adventurous action-packed film with great characterizations and memorably intense sequences that has the genuine soul and energy of the Star Wars Saga. Which in turn even with all the recycling plot points makes for a gloriously satisfying experience for me. And that last scene of old Luke's face after all this time was literally goosebumps inducing! Can I please have Episode VIII: The Last Jedi right now? 9.5 out of 10.<br><br>P.S. So Luke's obviously going to be the new Master Yoda in the next part and probably will die like Yoda too. Rey and Ren are going to share a connection and they will fight together against Snoke at the very end. I'm also pretty sure there's going to be another "No I am your father" line in the upcoming episodes. Just calling it in advance. :3, 4.5,  Rizwan K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/843614706/, April 22 2017, N/A

 A couple decades ago we received three Star Wars prequels! Two of them were disappointing and the third one was good but not given the care that was given to the originals. 10 years later we have booted the CGI defecating George Lucas out of the directing chair and replaced it with J.J. Abrams. And let me tell you that Mr. Abrams and Disney have really delivered I was super impressed by the job they did on this film. Is it a perfect Star Wars film? No but it was closer to what a Star Wars film should be like. <br>So what did I like and what problems did I have with it.<br><br>The New Characters are very well written and performed very well the imagery and effects are spectacular with the use of both practical and computer-generated effects John Williams score is always on point and the action scenes are beautifully shot. To my surprise there was a lot of humor in the film however it is done brilliantly and subtly which is an immense improvement over Jar-Jar Goddamn Binks from the prequels. <br><br>So that was the good now on to the flaws to begin the story while good borrows way too much from episode IV A New Hope. Both films involve the opposing forces interrogating the protagonists for some important Data which is given to a droid which comes into possession of a force sensitive protagonist who ends up helping the rebellion destroy a space station and becoming a hero. Now I am going to excuse this for the fact that this is only the first movie of what is suppose to be a new trilogy and because the story for the two other films is unknown at this point it's? not fair to hold this against it.<br>However what I can hold against it are the continuity errors. Now there aren't that many of these but the few that there are are serious. For example the character Rey comes in contact with a lightsaber That Luke lost when his hand was severed in Bespin during his duel with Vader in Episode V which you all know took place on a giant catwalk over a giant pit that leads to the outside of the building which is up in the clouds. Now again maybe they will explain this later in the story but even then it is a little too convenient that the lightsaber was actually found.<br><br>With my complaints aside I really enjoyed this movie and am looking forward to watching the next movie when it's released. I rate this film 4.5/5 stars., 4.5,  Jacob L, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/971507953/, March 11 2017, N/A

 I know that the pop and circumstance of this movie's arrival interferes with any individual's acceptance of the film but that still doesn't account for the been-there-done-that feeling stale character development cliché plot devices and genuinely poor acting. Yeah the music and special effects are good but since we're dealing with John Williams and ILM here who doesn't expect that? It is still a Star Wars movie isn't it? Unfortunately this movie also rips nearly every idea from Star Wars stories already well known. As one character says simply having the strength to do what is necessary to soldier through this flick will easily realize what kind of ending(s) we're going to get long before any character even lifts a finger.

 While the movie takes a lot of influence from A New Hope it breathes life into a franchise that certainly needed a boost after the prequels. J.J Abrams directs the movie very well newcomers Daisy Ridley John Boyega and Adam Driver all give solid performances but Harrison Ford brings it as he reprises his role as Han Solo. Not a lot of Carrie Fisher Mark Hammel or Oscar Isaac but they do get some screen time. The movie is chock full of things that made the original trilogy great. It may also be the funniest Star Wars movie ever. BB8 is excellent as comic relief and steals every scene he's in.

 The Force Awakens is truly an excellent movie and a glowing testament of how good JJ Abrams is as a writer and director. As everyone knows me personally I'm a huge huge Star Wars fan and this was the return to form I've waited a very long time to see. Some shocks some wonderful moments of knowing humour and some terrific new additions to the cast which hold your attention from the word get go before more established characters are reintroduced to fans that in itself it's not easy feat. But like the original trilogy you care about these characters regardless weather it's know actors or not playing them because the writing is so damn good. Special bonus for me some of it was shot very close to where I grow up in Puzzlewoods near Coleford in The Forest Of Dean so this a very special deal for me. I'm going back to watch it hopefully two more times with one of the showings in IMAX., 4.0,  DARREN C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/424013845/, May 19 2017, N/A

 A surprisingly delightful new saga in the Star Wars series catching up as it does 30 years after the rebels defeated the dark side in 'Return Of the Jedi'. The most noticeable change in tone from the self-reverential prequel trilogy last decade is the welcome injection of humour and old faces (Harrison Ford Carrie Fisher and Mark Hammil) blending with a younger cast of equally strong performers (Daisy Ridley John Boyega and a charismatic but under-used Oscar Isaac). Kylo Ren is the bad guy in this universe played by Adam Driver he's a sinister emo Darth Vader- wannabe who as we discover even prays to the dark lord's melted helmet- the guy clearly has some daddy issues but that would be revealing too much about the plot for those who are yet to see it! Despite the strength of the cast it is Harrison Ford's (30 million dollar) return to the role of Han Solo that gives the film a lot of its enjoyment and warm nostalgia. It is also the guiltiest of pleasures seeing Han back in the cockpit of the Millenium Falcon with Chewbacca! Ford actually turns in one of his most entertaining performances in years and his scenes with Carrie Fisher also have a sentimental spark about them. Now as for Luke the dark side are trying to find out where he is (filmgoers too!) but enough of that I think he may be a more central part of the next installment!..., 3.5,  Adam T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976325309/, May 17 2017, N/A

 Every new Star Wars movie in an exceptional event. Especially after it's been so long since the last one and with a whole new creative crew behind the wheel.<br><br>Unfortunately this episode turned out to be a bit derivative. Unlike previous SW movies after seeing this there wasn't anything particularly memorable about it except the fact that it a freaking new Star Wars movie. I thought that villains were rather weak and new characters seemed like they were from a spin-off rather than new characters of the main trilogy. <br><br>So all in all worth watching as a new Star Wars episode but don't expect to be blown away by it. It's an iteration rather than new take. New episodes will show the true potential., 4.0,  Alex K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/906482092/, May 14 2017, N/A

 Now that I´ve seen it for a second time I can say I really dislike Finn. Exaggerated dialogue delivery and gesticulation. Sorry had to get that out of the way. This is a great movie solid but the thing I enjoyed the most was the ending. That scene Luke revealing his face to a Rey with arm outstretched lightsaber in hand just beautiful. Then the camera starts panning around them and the island...one of the most emotional technical shots I´ve ever seen. I loved the scenes with C3PO. They make you feel completely immersed in a "this is Star Wars" feeling. I have a few complaints but they don´t harm the movie overall too much Finn less CGI please (alien characters) and...Snoke? Seriously? A signature of Star Wars is having cool badass character names and they go ahead and name the ultimate villain of them all...Snoke? What the hell?!

 Lucas is out. Abrams is in. Aside from a heavy reliance on call backs and formulaic "Star Wars-ien" trends TFA still works. It's a return to the breezy fun of the original trilogy while introducing interesting new characters that exhibit high ceilings. Ridley Boyega and Driver are all strong here. Abrams gives SW fans large doses of what the prequels were missing slick storytelling and a tangible aesthetic. Practical effects win out over the previous CGI fests and Williams' score is first rate. For me the fun factor outweighs the problems with the plot. Over all a tough job well done J.J., 3.5,  Wayne H, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/879867338/, May 7 2017, N/A
 Star Wars: The Force Awakens really did a fantastic job of holding on the old iconic cast from the original Star Wars films while also introducing us to a truly amazing new cast and a well-written story which was astoundingly riveting and much like a story in A New Hope but it wasn't trying to be like it.

 If Empire is considered a 10 as far as Star Wars films go I would consider this to be an easy 8 or 9. People have frowned upon it's similarities to ANH but personally I think that is what makes it so lovable. It is giving fans a sense of familiarity in an otherwise totally new time period and is exposing new inexperienced star wars viewers a tried and tested method of creating intricate amazing new worlds for them to fall in love with. All the characters are perfect and the use of practical effects gains the trust of those opposed to the prequel trilogy. JJ really listened to what fans needed and he delivered. It is a perfect star wars film for the seasoned fan and a perfect introduction to a new generation of fans., 4.0,  Hunter T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976136140/, March 5 2017, N/A

 It's GOOD but its also damn frustrating and leaves me with many questions about where this going to go. SLIGHT SPOILERS ahead.... Ready? I just feel in the end the Resistance seems to have everything going their way They've got Dapper Finn the mysterious Rey who's Force comes on like magic and the (presumably) returning Skywalker. For the Dark side we don't have any mega bad guys it seems. There are two would-be leaders who are forever squabbling to their shadowly overlord (who will probably turn out to be a midget who's broadcast to look 3 stories tall) Kylo Ren quite menacing at the beginning is made to look terribly weak in the end. And why that STUPID MASK? <br>So yes I have issues. Great action sequences though.<br><br>Rewatch notes: I'm over the frustration lol. This was a fun rewatch for sure.

 Please look out for Spoilers below.<br><br>I give this installment SOME credit because it does have basic entertainment value and I personally was a bit exhilarated to be seeing the Star Wars universe moving truly forward after nearly 4 decades. But after that initial exhilaration wore off and I could see the plot in full after having watched it I realized just how lazy and derivative the whole enterprise was. I honestly felt a little ashamed for having somewhat enjoyed myself at first as if I'd been played for a fool.<br><br>In Return of the Jedi the Empire was defeated right? I thought we were done with them. I figured we'd be moving on and find a new enemy to try and suppress the fledgling resurgence of said Jedi. But no. Turns out the Empire wasn't remotely defeated. They literally just re-branded. They actually have uniforms so similar to the original trilogy Empire that you would think the style would have shifted even if they DID acknowledge being the exact same organization. They also have fundamentally the same ships. And they can't let go of this "Death Star" idea...but that too has been re-branded. And made bigger. And a little more efficient. But do you want to guess how you take down this "don't call it the Death Star" Death Star? Naturally in a combination of the ways they destroyed the first two. So yeah...a big part of the plot is literally just a re-hash of IV and VI.<br><br>Not to mention the fact that the hero starts on a Desert Planet that looks and operates so identically to Tatooine that you have to hear it called something else multiple times before it sinks in that she's not in fact on Tatooine. I'm told that that distinctly Coruscant-looking place that the non-Death Star attacks at one point is oddly not actually Coruscant though that was entirely lost on me when I was actually watching because well...it's definitely Coruscant. A big part of the story takes place on a planet that looks suspiciously like Endor as well. So there's that.<br><br>But from an unbiased narrative perspective the most glaring flaw (yes even worse than the Empire continuing to do Empire things but refusing to be called the Empire) is the fact that the primary antagonist is essentially a MUCH weaker version of Darth Vader (commanded of course by a less human and more CGI version of the Emperor) and the hero somehow becomes effectively a Jedi with approximately the power of Episode VI-era Luke Skywalker literally a matter of minutes after she first finds out that the force is a thing. No training. Already stronger and more skilled than the pale shadow of Darth Vader she's got to fight. But just in case the fact that the neophyte protagonist is already a grandmaster compared to the hapless villain doesn't make the audience secure enough in the knowledge of a blowout victory she also gets to tag-team emo Darth Vader with the help of a (non-clone because this is fresh material guys) Storm Trooper who despite having no apparent command of the force is reasonably decent with a light saber himself for a non-Jedi beginner with no practice.<br><br>It was technically well-executed but if someone put this script on the internet as fan fiction I think it would be mocked. I can't believe they didn't try harder to avoid plagiarism and easy victories when relaunching such a lucrative franchise., 2.5,  Dan C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/556364500/, February 17 2017, N/A

 This is god-awful Jar Jar Abrams movie.<br>The plot is feeble and little thought was given to the previous movies and how characters should develop and how they should develop with the force. The movie is saved by Harrison Ford Peter Mayhew and Carrie Fisher. Although I feel that even Carrie Fisher's lines not the delivery but how they were structured were completely wrong. Again another failing of JJ Abrams. Wooden acting by Daisy Ridley and suffered mediocre performances right across the board. Star Wars: A New Hope Part 2 because we couldn't think of anything else.<br>Is anyone else forgetting the monsterous failings of Star Trek and Star Trek Into Darkness? I cringed when I heard Abrams was at the helm and it delivered the predictable amount of nonsense I've come to expect.<br>I thought it was shameful the way this movie was paraded as something amazing something incredible when it was missing so much.<br>Out classed out penned and out shone by Rogue One I sincerely hope they have pulled it together with The Last Jedi., 3.0,  JOSEPH%20 B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976051648/, February 10 2017, N/A

 After years of disappointments from the prequel trilogy I had low low expectations for a new Star Wars movie especially one funded by Disney. But I was hooked after the opening scene and I was entertained until the credits. "The Force Awakens" offers nearly everything any good blockbuster should while holding back on what a new installment in a franchise should offer. This movie has likable well-acted characters with clear motivations. They may seem basic I'm aware but in this current Hollywood climate it's always worth mentioning. All of our new characters do feel a touch underwritten but in truth no Star Wars character has remarkable depth to them. The story and plot are also thin with many beats coming directly from the first film in the franchise 1977's "Star Wars." However this isn't a problem for me. While I would've enjoyed something fresh more even if it fell flat J.J. Abrams brings to the table what I fell is his best direction yet. The movie is exciting when it needs to be dramatic when it ought to be lighthearted at appropriate moments and humorous. This movie is over two hours in length but it feels so much shorter. You will be invested in every frame. I think you'd have to be a hardened cynic not to enjoy "The Force Awakens.", 4.0,  Seth H, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976040224/, February 6 2017, N/A
 A film that has to cater to the constantly-expanding fanbase and serve as a gateway for newcomers to the franchise is a pretty tall order but I believe that J.J. Abrams and the cast and crew pulled it off quite amazingly. It expands upon the previous chapters of the Star Wars saga while serving as the beginning of something bigger. A new journey for a new cast of characters (with the guidance of familiar faces). The action is amazing and executed in true Star Wars fashion. The new heroes and villains have interesting personalities that will have you wanting more of them (probably with the exception of Captain Phasma). As for the storyline it can be said that it does feel like a rehash of A New Hope but it's gone about so differently that you'll most likely be able to forgive it for that. It's a solid entry in the Star Wars saga that will have excited for what they have in store for us in the future., 4.5,  Isaac A, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976036574/, February 6 2017, N/A

 (MIGHT CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS). It has been many years since the Rebels have officially defeated the Empire and now a new and more powerful version of the "Empire" has risen and Luke Skywalker has suddenly disappeared. With some old friends as well as some new ones they all embark on another journey to defeat this so called "First Order" and their current Jedi leader bringing back the force as they go along. This was not too bad overall with a similar story/concept as the original Episode IV that brings us a similar beginning to yet another Star Wars trilogy. Of course with today's version of Hollywood special effects it certainly was visually engaging and stunning. Interesting cast of characters including Finn as well as Leia and Solo. Some of the acting I will admit seemed a bit deficient but overall it was better as the film went on.
