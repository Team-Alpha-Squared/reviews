### Our Mission
Reviews are the lifeblood of internet. They can make or break a sale, tell us what content is worth consuming, and help empower users to make well-informed decisions surrounding the products and services around them. But sometimes, be it from poor grammar, unfair bias, or underwhelming explanations, we turn to reviews only to be dissapointed.

Here are Review Renew, our goal is to help users. Why wade through thousands of reviews to find the handful that are well written, in the language you're searching for, concise, illuminating, and with just the right amount of detail? Using our state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithm you can sift through the rants and raves and find the exact reviews you're looking for.

With the aforementioned in mind, our mission is simple:

To classify reviews based on their usefulness and applicability; to determine the sincerity and efficacy of any given review.

### Our Guidelines
At Review Renew, we aim to be as objective as possible. The following serve as our rules surrounding what we believe constitutes good reviews.

Good reviews will:

1.	Assume everyone involved in the subject's creation did their best to make as good a product as possible. (Reviews cannot claim the director of a franchise film failed because he or she isn't a "true" fan, etc.)

2.	Be limited to the experience of the product from inside that product's presentation. (Reviews cannot be about financial success, other critical reactions, the politics of the creators, etc.)

3.	Be coherent and understandable--English, full sentences, reasonably free of typos and errors, concise and illuminating. (No rants/ravings, stream-of-consciousness, lack of proper paragraphs, etc.)

4.	Be substantive, such as: why you loved or disliked it, favorite or least favorite parts, the philosophy behind your opinions or an evaluation of evoked emotions. (We want to know your opinions: "I loved/hated it!" is a reaction; opinions are the reaction's explanation.)
