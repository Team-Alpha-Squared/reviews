The story has more plot holes than a flour sift. The characters are outright revolting. The effort being made to merchandise this filth is ridiculous! Fin is a coward, Rey is pathetic, and frankly those are the only descriptors I can give to almost any character I see in the story.

It would have been better ending than the stupid slackers we saw flying away with it.<br><br>No, this stands as proof. Proof that the Authors and Directors of this film have no concept of integrity, virtue, or ethics. A monument of delusional ignorance in our generation.

The best thing it has going for it is Rey, the first believable female Jedi to appear in the onscreen saga. So the only reason millions of fans flocked to the theater to see Episode VIII was to see Rey\'s story - to find out where she came from and how she received her powers. Essentially, J.J. Abrams pitched a softball to little Rian Johnson, the kid who eats paste and drools on himself, and somehow that kid dropped the ball. <br><br>Instead of receiving satisfactory answers to the questions that have haunted us these past two years, the audience received a diaper full of poo flung at its face. More disturbing, critics ate it up with a poo-eating grin and said, "Thank you, Disney, for making a strong feminist statement." And 49% of moviegoers wrote about how bold and unexpected it felt to have a diaper full of poo hurled at their faces. They denounced fans who questioned its integrity, asking, "What did you expect - the same old Star Wars movie you\'ve seen before?" We can all agree on one thing - this is not the Star Wars movie we were looking for.<br><br>Don\'t get me wrong, I appreciate The Last Jedi\'s originality. However, there exists a nearly infinite number of original plotlines not involving a diaper full of poo. Specifically, by "poo" I mean Poe, Poe prank calling General Huck Finn of the Costco Empire, Finn, Finn running around leaking bodily fluids around the spaceship, the spaceships chosen by the Costco Rebels that either used 1940\'s bombing technology in zero gravity or run out of fuel after one jump to hyperspace despite their enormous size relative to the smaller craft that can jump to hyperspace without a care and travel to pointless subplots such as the rescue of The Codebreaker from Rainbow Bright, everything to do with Rainbow Bright including the disappointment resulting from the misuse of Benicio Del Toro in a pointless role that exists only to set up another film that Disney expects us to pay to see rather than utilize him as either The Collector from the MCU and profit from a crossover or better yet have him play a more vital role in the establishment of the First Order whose origins remain unexplained and who have somehow managed to resurrect themselves in a matter of days following their defeat in the previous film, all of the questions from the previous film receiving a middle finger from the writer of this piece of trash who answers questions like a drunk dad trying to get his kids to go to sleep ("hey dad, how did Rey get her powers?" "who cares, her parents were deadbeats who sold her for drinking money!" "hey dad, why did Kylo Ren destroy the Jedi Academy?" "because Luke Skywalker is an a-hole who walks out on his family!"), the complete desecration of the beloved hero of the Star Wars hero Luke Skywalker by showing him not only drinking milk from the tits of a sea monster but willing to murder his nephew yet unwilling to face him as demonstrated by his massive effort exerted to create a holographic likeness of himself to pretend to face Kylo Ren across the galaxy, this effort resulting in Luke\'s unnecessary death which would have meant something if he had chosen to die fighting Kylo Ren face to face in the first place . . . basically the entire movie - you get the idea, right?<br><br>Dissecting this movie is exhausting, because it is a labyrinth of confusion. Why? Something to do with feminism and proving that anyone can be a Jedi. Accordingly, the film introduces a purple-haired feminist caricature, who we will call Admiral Gender Studies, to put Poe in his place. First of all, we have established that no one really cares about Poe. More importantly, the film had unique feminist icons in both Rey and Leia already, characters that we do care about. Rather than compose great stories about these beloved characters, the writer chose to drone on about some nonsense built to support his hollow agenda. I say this because his is a) a man and 2) a rich, white man hired by a massive multi-national corporation to create a blockbuster installment in the most profitable money-making franchise in movie history. How about making a movie about how anyone can become a screenwriter? There are hundreds of people with MFAs in screenwriting working as baristas who would give anything to have the chance to write a Star Wars script. Yet Disney gave the golden ticket to this unworthy fellow, this spoiled hack who can\'t write his way out of a paper sack, this fraud who has the audacity to tell kids that anyone can grow up to become a Jedi, standing on the shoulders of giants while he laughs all the way to the bank.<br><br>This film is not just a bad movie and not just an insult to millions of fans. It is an act of malice, much like Luke attempting to burn the Jedi scrolls. It is an affront to humanity, for if this is the most we can achieve with millions of dollars and the most creative minds hard at work, then we do not deserve to survive as a species. God might have mercy on The Phantom Menace because at least it respected the legacy, but The Last Jedi deserves to burn in Hell.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977054596/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/10215133203946738/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977054596/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 15, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> The Last Jedi is the worst Star Wars movie yet and a terrible follow-up to The Force Awakens, which I thought to be overall a decent reboot to the series. Over half of the plot in The Last Jedi could have been completely removed from the movie and it would make no difference to the overarching storyline. There were unanswered questions from the last film that were answered in the most absurd and disappointing ways. There is also a plethora of plot holes, and the SJW agenda is blatantly obvious and unnecessary - I went to see a Star Wars film, not a propaganda film. The only redeeming factor in this whole movie is the visual effects, but that should be expected of any Star Wars film with a similar budget. Don\'t let Rian Johnson anywhere NEAR episode IX. I will not be rewatching this one.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/878074245/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/1789856393/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/878074245/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Douglas M</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 15, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> This installment was complete garbage.

The more I analyze this movie the more angry I become at it. Never have I experienced a property that so callously dismisses and insults its source material. Disregarding the idiotic plot holes, obvious sjw political agendas, the treatment of the character of Luke Skywalker is enough to warrant a bad review. One more thing, the character of Rey IS a Mary Sue. Compare her character arc to that of Luke\'s, by the second film she has defeated a trained Jedi in Kylo, mastered the Jedi mind trick, mastered the light saber bested Luke FRIGGIN Skywalker, all with NO TRAINING! By Empire Luke had been trained by two Jedi masters, had to be saved several times by Obi and Han, was nearly killed on Hoth and realized that Yoda was right, he wasn\'t ready. This point was demonstrated when he tried to face Vader and lost his hand after getting his ass whipped. Rey hasn\'t struggled or overcome anything. She is the definition of Mary Sue. If that offends you then you are likely a man-hating sjw snowflake, an idealogue like Johnson and Kennedy that just ruined this franchise.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/972632178/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/874459962653329/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/972632178/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Joshua O</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="50"></span></div> A very different Star Wars movie. Rian Johnson took a lot of risks and went different directions from a lot of plot lines that were laid out in The Force Awakens. I think the majority of viewer dislike has to do with going into the movie with certain expectations of how the story should go. Don\'t do that, you WILL be disappointed. While I don\'t agree with the path some of the arcs went either, that doesn\'t mean they "Suck" or are "trash". There is one section that feels a little disjointed and I fear that\'s because of cuts to the film. At over 2 1/2 hours long, Rian said his first cut was over 3 hours, I feel that they were forced to pear down the second act of the film, thus causing the clunky feeling I got from it. Overall a solid addition to the SW universe.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Steve M."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977021833/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Steve M</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span>\xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="15"></span></div> signed up on RT just to review this disappointment of a movie. <br>i frequent RT all the time to check movie reviews. not from the "critics" but from actual people. the critics are often opposite what the average audience thinks and this film is no exception. i checked the ratings before i went to see it last night and saw the critics praised it while the audience didnt seem to care much for it. still, being a SW fan for the past 40+ years i went in with an open mind and hoped all those normal people would be wrong. after all, Rogue One was pretty good and TFA was ok....<br><br>unfortunately, this movie was a stinker. the first 5 minutes let us know that with Poe\'s attempt at Iron Man type humor. really? in a SW movie? corny jokes/gags? it didnt stop there unfortunately...<br>there\'s so much wrong with this movie i dont even know where to start. luckily there\'s plenty of reviews out there pointing out all the flaws. too bad studio execs probably just ignore these reviews and ratings anyways. after all, the movie will rake in tons of cash, as usual. <br>but ill point out a few things that bugged me:<br>*corny jokes/gags<br>*WWII style bombs using gravity....in space? as if having sound wasnt bad enough but using gravity to drop bombs? <br>*year of the woman? i guess. do they really need to put women in there everywhere you look? could they make it any more obvious? as if Princess Leia wasnt a strong enough woman on her own. and now we have the main star, Rey, being femaile which is totally cool. but geez, try not to overdose on gender equality here...<br>*lets put a black guy in there and make a prominent character. but lets not give him any real importance. lets keep him a useless coward that is always ready to bail on everyone. <br>*after TFA we were led to believe Capt Phasma (another female) would really be more prominent in TLJ. what a waste of a potentially good character.. even worse than the OT\'s use of Boba Fett.<br>*Chewie? wasted excellent character. left to bbq a penguin thing and then feel sorry about it and pet rescue a family of them<br>*Luke? way to ruin a childhood legend. turn him into a crotchety old d-bag with a grumpy old attitude. only to run out of energy points and die from exhaustion... and he became a psycho who was about to murder his own nephew in cold blood because he was strong in the force??<br>*yoda? lolwtf. a pyromaniac psycho during his brief appearance.<br>*Rey is a good character but could use some more character development. her parents? that big mystery? eh, no time for that. so she\'s a nobody. wtf?<br>*Kylo Ren. he could use more character development as well but he and Rey are definitely the strongest characters in this whole film (and that\'s not saying much really)<br>*Snoke? they make a big deal of him in TFA and make him seem like he\'s the most powerful villain ever, just to toss him aside like a storm trooper. love the way he sits in his thrown all casual as well. that was odd.<br>speaking of odd, luke milking the cows balls/boobs? and then having a green milk mustache....ok... and Finn being naked in the plastic suit with juice squirting out all over the place...<br>*Poe....who is this guy? no backstory but he\'s supposed to be a major player apparently. does whatever he wants and starts a mutiny only to be slapped and later lead the group. <br>*Holdo? more like weirdo.... they should have had Leia pilot the ship into the dreadnaught. that would have been a great sendoff. <br>*speaking of Leia, mary poppins anyone?? beyond stupid!<br>*Benicio Del Toro. what a waste of a talented actor and an interesting character. maybe he\'ll make an appearance in the next film but at this point, who cares..<br>*one long, slow chase. the ships are going to run out of fuel? really? lol. <br><br>there\'s more and i could go on for days....<br><br>i had zero connection to anyone in this film. I was kind of hoping Finn and the Rose? would both die. they were both annoying. Finn is useless and just seems to overact, constantly. the forced romance was unexpected and a surprise, even to Finn. he\'s like, wtf? that wasnt in the script!<br><br>the OT created characters that were larger than life. that you felt emotionally attached to. at some you sat on the edge of your seat because you actually felt like they were in genuine peril. you could care less in TLJ. even the prequels established some strong characters that you felt attached too and felt concerned for their potential doom. <br><br>im surprised i stayed awake during this film. i kept checking my watch to see if would be over soon. <br><br>ive seen the OT many, many times. like most people who grew up on them. ive seen the prequels a few times as well. theyve grown on me (boy am i sorry GL left!). i own dvds of Ep 1-6. i will probably watch TFA again at least once and certainly Rogue One. i could care less if i ever see TLJ again. <br><br>what a way to ruin a legacy and powerful story line that captivated the world. they may as well just let michael bay direct the last film so they can really screw it up.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Matt B."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/946219167/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Matt B</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="50"></span></div> Absolutely loved it!

The reunion with Luke was very well handled even though he turned out to be a bloody hologram, jeez.<br>I loved the reunion of Luke with Yoda, to me the most moving scene, quite magical.<br>Ok, the gripes:<br>- Luke was badly handled and I know it\'s a very subjective opinion, but on this topic it can\'t be anything else of course. I didn\'t want, what some fans seemed to be craving for, a reunion with Leia and Han and the old gang kicks ass one more time. That would have been stupid in my mind, but the way it eventually ended up being handled didn\'t feel right to me either.<br>Of course the movie is about Luke/Rey (being the last Jedi) I excpected way more than the scenes they had together.<br>Even though, if you think back, Luke\'s training by Yoda wasn\'t spend that much time on either, but somehow impacted you more, because Luke leaves, though before completing it, called away by the urge to save his friends. Rey leaves, because she has no time left to help her friends, but also because she is disappointed and failed by Luke, Big difference.<br>Also a gripe that keeps resurfacing, the parallels with the original trilogy are becoming a bit annoying and to be honest, come accross as a bit lazy by the writers.<br>Rey has become annoying and in no way captures your heart as Luke did in the original trilogy, sorry, she has a lot of spunk, but memorable she the character is not. Don\'t know why yet, but I think it\'s the writing not the actress.<br>Still don\'t have a clue what Finn is good for in this story, baffles me how he keeps getting screentime even though the character is developing nowhere.<br>Damon Poe has replaced him as the more fun rebel.<br>Didn\'t like at all the send offs of two of the new villains Snoke as well as Captain Phasma, apart from the fact that nobody kicks Brienne of Tarth\'s ass, sorry Poe, they both deserved a way better ending, having been build up in part seven and then show them once and off they go?<br>That;s crappy writing and no one will convince me otherwise and a shame because both had potential.<br>Anyway, I am very glad there was a new Star Wars and well, since the old garde is now gone, I hope they will start truly taking the reigns of the franchise storywise and actually come up with someting new and not just a badly disguised rehash of the original trilogy.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Joey J."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977054512/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Joey J</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> While ostensibly a continuation of an existing universe this film and the previous incarnation attempt to "reboot" the universe by retrying what has already been done in the original trilogy. The plot for this movie is borrowed from Empire Strikes Back, one of the most beloved films in the series, but it eschews any attempt at logic or structure to try and get the characters to where the story envisions them. The utter nonsensical and baffling turn of events is not even consistent within the singular movie, let alone in the wider universe in which it is set. For example, the Resistance Fleet (read rebranded Rebels) are fleeing the First Order (read rebranded Imperials) who are waiting for the ships to run out of gas so they can pick them off. Ignoring the OJ Simpson White Bronco chase premise, we then have two characters get in a ship and jump out of the system in an awkward and politically charged capitalism refutation. If we ignore the many problems we are already passing over we are still left with the very real fact that the First Order did not pursue their ship leaving the fleet. So... could they have sent out more of them? Could they have just placed their most important people onto that ship and never returned? Let\'s move past this. The main character played by Daisy Ridley is off for her training with Luke Skywalker, The Last Jedi. Except, again, they do not train. By the time Rey leaves we have found out that Luke likes to contemplate murdering his own sleeping nephew like a psychopath and that he drinks weird milk from some sea cow. Rey, setting off to save the day, arrives to face the most powerful force user in the galaxy with still no idea how to use then force or swing a lightsaber etc. Think about that! This is a Galaxy where literally thousands of Jedi could not do what she does, and they had the Jedi Order and a lifetime of training and perfecting their skills. Ok, so she\'s must have some of that super sweet Skywalker blood or something, and we will get a big reveal? Nope, she\'s born of drifters who sold her to buy booze and die in the desert. (Clearly this is simply a red herring so that JJ can have his "Rey, I\'m your mother!" line in episode 9 that we aren\'t supposed to see coming... so shhhh!) okay, so we are again supposed to be taken in by the "risks" the director took by so breaking with the movies that came before that the final battle doesn\'t take place on a frozen world like Hoth, no, it\'s an ice world that shimmers like snow. Okay, well at least they\'ve had 30 years to make new vehicles right?! Nope, they are the same vehicles from 1970s but this time with an extra hump on their back. Okay, well at least in a Star Wars Film there will be a lightsaber Battle right? No, Luke will show up and stand there while his nephew does his best to kill him, only to find out that alike never left his dirty little island, and in fact, he\'s now going to die. Having done what? Oh well he stood there and that sent a message to the galaxy to "light the fires of resistance." Wait, I thought that the new guys were part of the government that formed after the Imperials were defeated. Nope. They were but weren\'t defeated, left the galaxy, stole a bunch of kids, changed their name and got a big ugly dude to lead them and then came back, wiped out the leader of the legitimate government in the slaughter of 7 whole world\'s... but we need Luke to show up as a hologram to light the fire under peoples asses. What?!? You mean people stood by while they destroyed billions of lives and now they are gonna come because some guy nobody has seen in years didn\'t show up? Oh and he\'s dead now too, along with every other member o cyber resistance except like 10 people on the millennium falcon. Seriously, this is the best they could come up with? Have they never talked to an actual fan? Do they just want to write it with the same level of competency of a middle school writing class? <br><br>Don\'t watch this movie. Don\'t support this movie.

However there were a couple head scratching moments. One would be how short Rey\'s training with Luke was. It was basically two scenes, while Luke\'s with yoda back in the original trilogy was much more in dept and longer. The other moment would be the whole Finn and Rose and the code breaker part which just never needed to happen. They basically put themselves in danger for no reason at all. But besides these blemishes I loved it.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/792587328/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/859020315/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/792587328/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Bobby S</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="40"></span></div> I loved Rian had the balls to change things up it was bold and it\'s what star wars needed.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/797625242/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/541271335/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/797625242/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Charlie H</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> How disappointing.<br><br>The entire 2nd act could have been cut, it was boring and completely unnecessary, especially if the Admiral had *SPOILER* JUST TOLD POE WHAT THE PLAN WAS IN THE FIRST PLACE!!

Zero out of five stars is too easy of a decision. Not only a horrendous Star Wars movie, but also one of the worst movies I\'ve ever had the misfortune of watching. It made the prequel trilogy look like masterful work. I don\'t see how this dumpster fire ever made it to the screen. A complete money grab with an elementary school level plot, if you can call it that. It\'s like Rian, JJ, Kathleen Kennedy, and Disney have never seen Star Wars or decided to murder franchise. And that they did. They\'ve killed a beloved franchise.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/945215212/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/100001662098453/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/945215212/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Thurston L</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span>\xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="45"></span></div> Possibly the best Star Wars film I\'ve seen since the 80s. It\'s a tad too long but has a lot to explore and unpack in its run time. Fascinating developments and changes to what has unfortunately come to be expected of the franchise.

There were several "jump the shark" scenes that felt unnecessary but probably were there just to keep the story together. SO disjointed.. I defy anyone to make sense of the major gaps and contradictions in the film. It gets you cheering for one set of characters then makes you doubt their purpose and in the end there really are no heroes.. was that supposed to be the point?? Ugh..</div> </div> </div>']
