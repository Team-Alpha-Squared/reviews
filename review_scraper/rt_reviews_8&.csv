Zero out of five stars is too easy of a decision. Not only a horrendous Star Wars movie, but also one of the worst movies I\'ve ever had the misfortune of watching. It made the prequel trilogy look like masterful work. I don\'t see how this dumpster fire ever made it to the screen. A complete money grab with an elementary school level plot, if you can call it that. It\'s like Rian, JJ, Kathleen Kennedy, and Disney have never seen Star Wars or decided to murder franchise.

There were several "jump the shark" scenes that felt unnecessary but probably were there just to keep the story together. SO disjointed.. I defy anyone to make sense of the major gaps and contradictions in the film.

While there were a number of good moments, the overwhelming feeling leaving the cinema was that this film was not merely a missed opportunity (Snoke, Akbar, Luke etc.) but a trashing of the franchise, killing off its best characters and setting up a real turd of a finale. As good an actor as driver is, he lacks the menace necessary for this franchise; Rei goes in to the final movie as woefully underdeveloped as before; and, well, who is left? This was not The Last Jedi but The Last Star Wars; I hope the director enjoys his 30 pieces of silver for this effort: he will certainly go down in film history. The series is now, in my view, unsalvageable. <br>As for the positive critical reception, please Google (or better, use DuckDuckGo) \'Gamer Gate\' - its a total con job; these people were either paid off or are sucking up to someone big time.

I loved every moment. The visuals are spectacular the story is great and yet again the cast does an amazing job. Rian Johnson did a great job in my opinion, John Williams Score was yet again beautiful and was put in the film perfectly, and action sequences was spectacular. I personally don\'t get the hate, I found the character of Rose was good, the comedy worked and Luke\'s story was very believable. I know a lot wanted nostalgia seeing Luke as the great hero again and I would have too but I get why they changed the way he is from what happened in those previous years. Overall "The Last Jedi" is pure escapism at its best..

But the writing destroyed a lot a story tread that was set up in the previous film. Il also seem to want to destroyed the lore established by the 7 previous film. Some plot line seems totally pointless in the overall story of the film. The caracther has almost no real devellopement except for a contrive romantic story line that is cringe worthy. Star Wars has always had a politcal message in it\'s undertone but never a star wars movies has ever been so overtly politacal and make the watching experience very ackward at time.

However upon further reflection I have come to the conclusion that while containing interesting exploration of The Force as a... well force, the rest of the plot is so convoluted and horrendously bad that the recent film Jumanji had a better and more clear plot than anything this film has to offer. This is not only a disgrace to the legacy of Luke Skywalker. This is a slap in the face to the far more talented theory channels dedicated to bringing to life small explanations or fillings in that are more entertaining and captivating than cantobyte and the slow drawn out "chase" sequence that comprise this films runtime. This is the equivalent of if the opening of a new hope were made into its own film with unoriginal planets of "not Hoth" and "not Yavin 4", excepting cantobyte which is entirely filled with political commentary more fitting of a news station than an action adventure film. This is of course not mentioning the unbelievable and ludicrous "love" story between Finn and Rose. Why are they in love, they have been together at max twelve hours and most of that was spent having them at each others throats or sneaking around. But I digress. Having recently rewatched the entire series (minus TFA) I can definitively say that this movie is not deserving to be called finished as it was released, let alone a Star Wars movie.</div> </div> </div>']
