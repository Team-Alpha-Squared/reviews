However, it didn\'t take long for me to realise how very bad this film was. It\'s all good and well making a film in space, but if you\'re going to exist within the Star Wars universe, then it needs to be consistent with past films. This film gladly discards all of that, and though it may (at best) provide for a cheap laugh, it carries no weight. This film has no substance.

Luke Skywalker couldn\'t have summed up this film better. The Last Jedi was a massive disappointment and is undoubtedly going to be controversial amongst die hard Star Wars fans. It fails to continue many of the plots and themes created by its predecessor The Force Awakens and even goes as far as to undo them. This is mixed with a disrespect for the original six films taking fan favourite characters and reducing them from noble heroes to broken and unrecognisable versions of themselves (In particular Luke Skywalker.) Kylo Ren says the words \'let the past die, Kill it if you have to\' and this perfectly represents what Disney, Lucasfilm and Rian Johnson were clearly trying to achieve. They want to forge their own path and cement their own themes and plots. This would be ok if it wasn\'t for the fact that this film lack originality and copies vast amounts of Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi (from the walker assault on Krayt to Rey\'s training from an old Jedi in exile.) Many of Force Awakens problems continue to plague this new instalment. Rey is still overpowered, Kylo Ren is still a lost child having tantrums and the aforementioned issue of rehashing the original trilogy is still present. I chose to put these issues aside for the Force Awakens however it has become so apparent that it has made me rethink Force Awakens and practically destroyed my expectations for Episode IX. To say this film has ruined Star Wars for me would be an exaggeration but it has certainly made me sceptical of the future of the franchise.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/920033611/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/100001533160384/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/920033611/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Kenneth J</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> I thought Seven was bad just because it was a rehash.

I like it, I have seen them all. But this movie fails at so many levels it is astonding. The plot ( what plot ?? ) is horrible. There should be a F- rating on here or Negative 5 stars. <br><br>I stand by the comments of so many other people here... the vast majority by the look of things. I agree with every negative comment about this film. I do not need to write all the points I disliked, as some 3000+ people before me have listed point by point the negatives.<br><br>But I have seen very few honest positive reviews with details why they liked it. <br><br>I give 1/2 a star for seeing Luke Skywalker, the visuals and the music score.<br><br>The rest of the movie with its social agenda, idiotic plots and fucking stupid story.... what the fuck am I saying there is no story !

Breaking the inner consistency and narrative coherence with itself, previous episode and full saga. Worst service to fans. Extremely cheap script writing, failing flatly and systematically humiliating any reference and fans at the same time. Playing destruction of a myth, without any talent, blatantly without actually knowing what it destroys, and nothing to propose instead. Please stop the massacre. And some people get paid millions to write this script or to validate it...</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="david a."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977047527/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> david a</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="20"></span></div> Dialogue was clunky, attempts at humor felt tone deaf, and after building up Snoke and Rey\'s parentage the way those plot threads were just tossed aside gave me whiplash</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/842079996/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/1102532908/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/842079996/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Chris D</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="20"></span></div> The space fights were pretty</div> </div> </div>']
