It actually made me angry and upset. I won\'t repeat what thousands of others have already covered but I simply can\'t fathom why they went down this road? For the life of me I can\'t see any upside to this? Why would Disney try to drive off Star War\'s most loyal fans? Contrary to the tripe in the movie you don\'t need to kill the past to move forward. They could have told the next Star Wars saga in a thousand different ways that would have pleased everyone (except maybe critics) but no - they elected to spit in the face of the people who love this franchise. Disney, you just killed your golden goose but you don\'t know it.

I mean how do you destroy a character like Luke Sky-walker? Why can Rey suddenly not act? Why are Poe and Finn trying to one up each others cringe worthy attempts at humour? Where is snokes backstory? The force awakens was not great by any standard but this movie falls so far below the bar!

It\'s all good and well making a film in space, but if you\'re going to exist within the Star Wars universe, then it needs to be consistent with past films. This film gladly discards all of that, and though it may (at best) provide for a cheap laugh, it carries no weight. This film has no substance.

Luke Skywalker couldn\'t have summed up this film better. The Last Jedi was a massive disappointment and is undoubtedly going to be controversial amongst die hard Star Wars fans. It fails to continue many of the plots and themes created by its predecessor The Force Awakens and even goes as far as to undo them. This is mixed with a disrespect for the original six films taking fan favourite characters and reducing them from noble heroes to broken and unrecognisable versions of themselves (In particular Luke Skywalker.) Kylo Ren says the words \'let the past die, Kill it if you have to\' and this perfectly represents what Disney, Lucasfilm and Rian Johnson were clearly trying to achieve. They want to forge their own path and cement their own themes and plots. This would be ok if it wasn\'t for the fact that this film lack originality and copies vast amounts of Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi (from the walker assault on Krayt to Rey\'s training from an old Jedi in exile.) Many of Force Awakens problems continue to plague this new instalment. Rey is still overpowered, Kylo Ren is still a lost child having tantrums and the aforementioned issue of rehashing the original trilogy is still present. I chose to put these issues aside for the Force Awakens however it has become so apparent that it has made me rethink Force Awakens and practically destroyed my expectations for Episode IX. To say this film has ruined Star Wars for me would be an exaggeration but it has certainly made me sceptical of the future of the franchise.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/920033611/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/100001533160384/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/920033611/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Kenneth J</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> I thought Seven was bad just because it was a rehash. This movie, with Luke\'s total destruction of his character, inability for superior\'s to tell subordinates a plan, power level creep to levels seen in anime, I just can\'t believe it. Former fan of Star Wars, this movie make me embarrassed to have ever been a fan at all.</div> </div> </div>']
