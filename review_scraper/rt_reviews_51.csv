And here, in my opinion, there is a problem. The director does not innovate at all, on the contrary: he multiplies the common visual effects (eg: jumps in space of a cohort of ships that recalls Battlestar Galactica 2004, slow-accelerated in a "Matrix" way, fields-contrefields filled with Philosophical Dialogues in a "Star Trek" way, humorous shots just like "Space Balls" or punchlines similar to the "Guardians of the Galaxy"...)<br>But nothing new, original or proprietary in all this. We are clearly no longer in a Star Wars visual grammar, but in a good SF film fairly anonymous on the form.<br>There remains an interesting and well conducted story (despite a few lengths that we would gladly avoid) that shows, repeatedly during 2H32, operations that are doomed to failure. Failures whom, paradoxically, the accumulation will lead to a victory: all the acts of rebellion fail miserably one after the other (loss of the Bombers then of the entire fleet, inability to escape from the tracking, operation "find the hacker" which is sold by a fiasco, operation "hacking" in the Imperial ship that also fails, final battle on Crait which is sold by a breakaway, failing to have been able to destroy the enemy cannon ...)<br>But the film shows that the approach of rebellion as such is more important than the result obtained. It is this approach, this mindset, that will allow to swarm with a new generation. In short: the mindset is more important than the result. We are in an anti-Sartre story: We are not the sum of our actions, but the sum of our intentions.<br>Finally, the interest in this film lies in the close relationship between form and substance: The director himself probably fails to propose anything new, but his approach of rupture (of rebellion) is nonetheless interesting, laudable and probably beneficial in the long term for the Star Wars franchise, just as in the story he tells us.<br>For the rest, I enjoyed the dialogues, the first half hour, some visually impressive shots (eg: some use of light speed at the end of the film), and the direction of actors.<br>In short, it is and upsetting film: neither any good, nor any bad, but disappointing in its way to destroy everything without being truly able to propose something new. I sometimes felt that the director was a little too ambitious: if Denis Villeneuve managed to reinvent Blade Runner without saying that he was, Rian Johnson fails to reinvent Star Wars while, for two and a half hours, he tells us he will do it.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/916205548/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/100002662444537/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/916205548/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Anthony K</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="50"></span></div> I loved it.

Needless to say, I went into the theater with high hopes. Sadly, I left with holes where my eyes should\'ve been. I was stunned by how trite and banal Johnson made the plot. Everything seemed way too inconsequential. How does a starship get low on fuel after one jump to light speed? In the originals and in the prequels, ships jump multiple times whether they are big or small. Wouldn\'t the rebels have had their fleet fully fueled in case they needed to escape? What kind of fuel do these star ships need and why don\'t they have reserves? <br><br>And why are people commending the series for a commitment to "diversity"? There are far less alien species in these new films than there were in either of the previous two trilogies... On top of the lack of diversity, how Disney uses aliens is pathetic. Why are Aliens placeholders rather than detailed characters? Yeah, we hate Jar Jar but at least he had a story. Chewy had a story. The Jawas killed by stormtroopers in A New Hope had a story. Jabba the Hut had a story. His Tw\'lek helper/translator had a story. So, where are the alien characters? Diversity? In a galaxy with more than just humans, there is an awful lot of screen time without any aliens except when they nod, say a single comment, or die (RIP Admiral Akbar). <br><br>And then there is Luke. Luke seems to have taken the situation with Kylo out of proportion... Even after understanding his sister is in critical condition, he would rather die alone than go and fight Snoke or Kylo? Give me a break... That isn\'t the Luke we remember. Luke stuck his neck out for his friends and family before himself. It was in his bones. He was like that when he was a young cynic hoping to join the Imperial academy to when he began training in the ways of the force and beyond. One event, in my opinion, even if it is his nephew, would not change a fundamental characteristic of who he is. He would be willing to protect leia. It is as if all the trials he went through during the original trilogy do not matter anymore. <br>They don\'t exist. He learned nothing about hope, trust, and loyalty even after taking lightning for his father? Yeah... I don\'t know about that...<br><br>There is much more I could say.<br>TBA.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Dylan B."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977046361/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Dylan%20 B</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/rating/wts.png"> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="wts"></span></div> It\'s a safe but also very, very different in what you would expect from "Star Wars". With many great performances from the likes of Mark Hamill, Daisy Ridley, and the amazing villain Adam Driver; it adds to the dramatic and sometimes comedic moments throughout the film. But unfortunately, no movie is without its flaws. I will not go into detail, but most of one subplot is essentially useless in the grand scheme of things to the movie, and it really shows. Along with that, there were some character decisions that took me out of the movie. Overall though, I thoroughly enjoyed "Star Wars: The Last Jedi". I cried and I laughed, and I was shocked with many moments and twists. I would recommend this to all.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977046365/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/10211351169910080/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977046365/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> I thought "the force awakens" was okay. I was looking forward to uncover the mysteries that we were presented in the previous movie. I wanted to see Luke teach Rey and I wanted to see the return of Luke Skywalker, the very last jedi. Possibly, a develop in Kylo Ren as well as the backstory of this super villain who came out of nowhere, supreme leader Snoke. The origin of Rey\'s parents, as well as the reason why Ben Solo became Kylo Ren. This movie disappointed me because it utterly ignored what was set up in "the force awakens", it completely destroyed the character of Luke Skywalker, turning him into a senile old joke, it gave Rey\'s character zero depth and zero reasons to back up her absurdly enormous powers... it\'s just this. It simply failed to deliver. On the other hand I felt preached about politics and feminism and I found that not only distasteful but most of all out of place. If I go to watch start wars, I wanna watch a star wars movie. This movie was visually stunning and the sounds were great. But when I watch a movie, that\'s the last thing that concerns me. First of all, I want to enjoy the plot. This movie has no plot (the story is literally stuck) and apart from Poe none of the characters has an arc. This is a movie I wish was deleted and remade from scratch, so it wouldn\'t hurt this current trilogy as well as the myth of the original one.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/973258526/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/687906020/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/973258526/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Gavin R</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> This film was awful.

Disney was going to turn Star Wars into "Frozen in Space". It has happened.<br><br>This movie is perfectly aligned with Disney\'s vision for Star Wars\' future. No hope, no empire, no rebellion, no good, no evil, no love, no friendship.. just an endless meaningless run around with deliberate miscasting to impose reverse racism, poor acting, plot holes, hollow action sequences which never get you to believe anyone is in any danger, all sprinkled with an overdose of mom jokes and product promotion for the next toy sensation made by Chinese slave labor.<br><br>But wait! there\'s more! How about we insult the intelligence of ticket paying audience by lecturing them on issues dear only to people living in the story writers\' delicate bubble while the movie rolls on! <br><br>What they did with the legacy of Star Wars?? This was Star Progs. Well done Ruin Johnson... you actually made the prequels look like cinematic triumphs. <br><br>This movie was like Ruin Johnson defecating on everything that we hold dear about Star Wars while Kathleen Kennedy and her feminazi band of story writers knocked on the door for him to hurry up and get it over with already. If you have to kill everything Star Wars at least give it a proper burial. Instead we got this turd.<br><br>The shills are in full force. Five star reviews asking us to watch it five times. Yeah like I\'d let Disney see a penny from me. Fool me once... shills claim.. "you were expecting this.. or that". Yes! When you make $1b off of garbage like this you know it was only cuz you waved Luke in front of the rubes. Let\'s see Mary Sue and emo Ren open in theaters on their own without OUR Star Wars heroes. You think people pay money to hear lectures on misogyny from Vice Admiral gender studies?? Shills will say.. "it was unexpected".. No idiots .. if you remake Godfather where the five families are run by moms, made men are eating veggie sandwiches and through three hours no one is whacked cuz that will trigger snowflakes.. that\'s not unexpected... that\'s garbage!<br><br>Leia Poppins is alive but Projection Luke died? When did the force work that way? Ever? Dead can now use lightning strikes in the living world.. ( nice sneak in of the book burning.. well done comrades). So next stop Force ghost Wars?.. Ben, Yoda Luke against Emperor, Snoke and Vader? Come on.. you know Ruin got all excited just thinking about the ways he could Ruin that too!<br><br>I\'m done .. yeah I know I said that two years ago but Disney has now blatantly displayed its hostility towards the original fan base.. I\'ve received the message loud and clear.<br><br>One Star.. only cuz Disney Damage Control convinced RT to throw out 1/2 star reviews as "outliers". That\'s why this stinker has a 49% score where the real number wouldn\'t crack 20%.<br><br>But of course it made a shit ton of money so what\'s not to like. Carry on Disney.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="deborah m."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/901349459/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Deborah A</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span>\xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="15"></span></div> If you want to see a movie that is basically a knock off of a previous version, go see this movie.

The plot was weak and boring. The sub plot was completely pointless and should have been avoided. I never write reviews, but this utter failure makes me angry enough to write something. Rey, never looses anything, she never has to train or learn anything. Her character was such a complete let down that it makes me ill. They had so much potential so many possible directions they could have gone but they chose this. Even if I wasn\'t a Star Wars fan...as a movie this is a complete failure. Physics? I can suspend my disbelief only so far before it just gets embarrassing. If I could give it negative stars I would.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/915495727/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/100002391851650/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/915495727/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Ron N</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> Everyone: Nobody can make a worse Star Wars movie than JJ Abrams<br><br>Rian Johnson: Hold my beer.</div> </div> </div>']
