However, this was not the GREAT movie that the star wars series deserves. I really wished that they told a star wars story that flowed and made sense. I have no problem with any political undertones, the side of the rebels has always been an inclusive side. I just wished it was a story that made the star wars universe seem like such a large, genuine place like the other movies did. This film doesn\'t make sense and it is a knock to the star wars series.

Its a garbage movie cinematographicly speaking. And im not a die-hard-the-original-triology-is-the-best-fan.Every production has its flaws as it is normal. But this one...JEEZ. Im a fan of movies in general and this was just a disaster. I entered the cinema with 0 expectations and still came out pissed. Useless, annoying and random characters doing useless, annoying and random sh*t, the so called "war" was the first order army versus a few petty resistance ships, still didnt explain why Rey is so goddamn overpowered, dumb, out of the blue situations that were just there for no reason (freeing the animals on the casino planet for example), Snoke\'s death was pathetic, Luke became the Joker, Yoda firing lightnings and topless Kylo...seriously? These are just some thing that literally crashed in front of me and made the movie...just bad. And lets not forget the capital cinematographic failure of the year, the scene with princess Leia in space. You cant just make this sh*it up, nor can I forgive it for existing. At least if it had some cool saber fights, but no, just slo-mo clumsy swinging. To conclude, I consider this movie to be an absolute attrocity, regardless of it being Star Wars or not.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Scott B."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977053032/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Scott B</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> Visually stunning.

But I didn\'t think it was too bad considering that ep VIII might explain some things. And explain them it did, in a way that just screams lazy screenwriting to me. Rey continues to be a massive Mary Sue, and even more so than in TFA. Poe is shown as an idiot even though all of the actions he took were the correct ones. And purple hair lady (I do not remember her name) is not just one of the worst movie characters I have ever seen, but also the worst admiral to have ever existed. Luke died in an extremely unsatisfactory way, and there wasn\'t a single lightsaber duel in the entire movie. And then there\'s Snoke, who for being so incredibly powerful sure seems like a nobody. Nothing about him is explained. <br>Basically TFA was bad, but it could have been redeemed and explained in this movie. It wasn\'t, not even in the slightest. I feel bad for JJ because of what he has to clean up now. None of his plot points were even remotely addressed by Rian Johnson and the movie is just a huge disappointment overall. The only good thing about it are the special effects, but that is to be expected of Star Wars, so they don\'t get any extra score for that.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="James R."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977052969/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> James R</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> Unbearably silly and stupid with the Leia flying in space scene and with an annoyingly forced and obvious political agenda that ruined what could have been an amazing film.

Instead, this is a harder tale of friendship, teaching, love and death with a darker vibe on the ongoing war. The character of Ren is much more relatable in this movie and Poe/Finn bring a wonderful dynamic to the series, in much the same way that Solo/Chewbacca did. A worthy entry to the series.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/784450358/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/7001425/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/784450358/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Jess B</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span>\xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="35"></span></div> A movie full of stunnng action sequences and bizarre "twists" that leave several characters\' pasts unexplained or under-developed.
