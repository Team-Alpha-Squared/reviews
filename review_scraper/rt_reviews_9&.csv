However upon further reflection I have come to the conclusion that while containing interesting exploration of The Force as a... well force, the rest of the plot is so convoluted and horrendously bad that the recent film Jumanji had a better and more clear plot than anything this film has to offer. This is not only a disgrace to the legacy of Luke Skywalker. This is a slap in the face to the far more talented theory channels dedicated to bringing to life small explanations or fillings in that are more entertaining and captivating than cantobyte and the slow drawn out "chase" sequence that comprise this films runtime. This is the equivalent of if the opening of a new hope were made into its own film with unoriginal planets of "not Hoth" and "not Yavin 4", excepting cantobyte which is entirely filled with political commentary more fitting of a news station than an action adventure film. This is of course not mentioning the unbelievable and ludicrous "love" story between Finn and Rose. Why are they in love, they have been together at max twelve hours and most of that was spent having them at each others throats or sneaking around. But I digress. Having recently rewatched the entire series (minus TFA) I can definitively say that this movie is not deserving to be called finished as it was released, let alone a Star Wars movie.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977054230/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/10112069313051714/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977054230/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> This movie was basically trash.

It added much needed depth to Kylo Ren, as well as giving much better insight into Rey. I appreciate the time spent getting to know both of these characters better. It dawdled in a few places, and had a tendency to use uninspired logic to move the plot forward. (Running out of fuel? Really?) The new characters that were introduced were fairly interesting, if not often unnecessary. The twist at the end was fantastic, and this movie included one of the most iconic Star Wars scenes ever. With a few tweeks in the script, this could\'ve been a solid 4/4.5 star movie.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Kuzman K."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/976970311/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Kuzman K</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="50"></span></div> Its simply amazing don\'t get the hate at all ....</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Jason R."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977054114/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Jason R</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> Seriously disappointing!</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Original Duke Fan"> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/976871547/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Bill S</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span>\xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="15"></span></div> This is the first time I have revised a rating based on a multiple viewing. I watched The Last Jedi for the second time, mostly because Ladybird was sold out. While I enjoyed it the first time, the flaws screamed out on the rewatch. The plot is pretty minimal, Finn\'s side mission is pointless, and our hero Luke Skywalker is just depressing to see. And I\'m sorry, seeing Rey as a super charged Mary Sue is agitating. You can\'t root for a protagonist who excels at almost every challenge and seems to have the wbility to best everyone at everything. It took Luke Skywalker almost three movies to become a strong Jedi, and Rey is all that right off the bat along with an ace pilot, mechanic, and basically anything else the plot calls for. At the end of the film I had one thought - how is one ship full of about 35-40 people supposed to present any real threat to the still powerful First Order? I guess it\'s Rey against the galaxy, and in this trilogy Rey will probqbly take everyone in a cakewalk.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/965231837/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/100001043584747/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/965231837/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Rory W</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="50"></span></div> A great addition to the Star Wars lore.

Plot holes were completely thrown out, and new ones were created. The writing was horrible, and Disney\'s humor just doesn\'t feel right inside of a Star Wars movie. This movie would be summed up as an hour and 30 minutes car chase through space, an unnecessary romance used for filler, and concluded by what was hands down the biggest letdown of the entire movie. Fans of the franchise will be disappointed, and folks new to the franchise will probably think it\'s fine. Either way, after watching it, it\'s pretty obvious how episode 9 will play out.

Jokes, one liners, and unnecessary CGI mar what is a blah plot line that is filled with holes. It is obvious that large parts of the story were cut out, even though the movie runs long. Most of the film\'s subplots are inconsequential in the big picture and really only involve stalling, the all-powerful villain is mishandled, and big problems seem to have simple solutions that come off as cop-outs. In an effort to seem progressive and teach a lesson it fails to entertain as we expect from Star Wars movies.

John Williams\' score is amazing as always.<br>To the haters: get over yourselves.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Peter R."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977053976/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Peter R</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="10"></span></div> I got my rotten tomatoes account because of this film. While visually beautiful, musically pleasing, and great sound effects, that is about it. Character development was a waste, there are numerous plot holes, and Disney has tried very hard to push both forced humor and social agendas. Ive never rated a film before, but this was bad. Disney has its clutches around some of the best franchises in the history of entertainment, but if TLJ is any indication, we can expect those franchises to die mediocre, sloppy, joke ridden, merchandise driven, money grubbing, visually impressive deaths.</div> </div> </div>']
