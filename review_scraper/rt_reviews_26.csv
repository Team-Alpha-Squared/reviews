Although some people seem to have wasted considerable time trying to subsequently work out explanations for these plot holes, if they mean you don\'t enjoy the film whilst you are watching it, what is the point? <br><br>For some reason the ponderous chase plot unfortunately reminded me of the OJ police chase from 94\' and just about as ridiculous. <br><br>Lot\'s been said about the juvenile casino side plot and I so I don\'t need to explain why I found myself constantly rolling my eyes and looking away from the screen often during this portion of the movie. <br><br>As has also often been noted, Rey is two-dimensional with no interesting back story/characteristics/development; I like Daisy Ridley as an actress - but what a god awful character for her to work with :( <br><br>I also hate what they did to Domnhall Gleeson in this, I felt so embarrassed for him; he is a way better actor then the dreadful comedic \'Hux\' role. It actually made me sad to see him portrayed this way...<br><br>My overall impressions:<br>- The acting was good in places (especially Hamill) but the characters (especially Rey) were poorly written. Some of the dialogue was dreadful to the point of making me cringe.<br>- Visually, it generally looked good.<br>- Plot was absolutely dreadful, lazy and just made for a poor, poor experience for me at the cinema.<br>- Humor was more miss than hit and felt really out of place in this.<br><br>When a movie makes you want to walk out and you feel as though you have wasted both your time and money, how can I give it more than 1/2 a star?<br><br>As a side note, whilst I have read, understood and agree with many peoples criticisms of this movie I find a lot less information about why some people also seemed to like this film. Honestly the positive reviews I have read provide very little insights into the \'good\' aspects of this movie but rather often seem concerned with insulting or bashing the people who genuinely did not enjoy this experience.<br><br>If you enjoyed this movie, great, I respect your opinion, please also return the favor to others who really, really did not.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977050496/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/1847579785283486/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977050496/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> Rian Johnson replaced Star Wars with SJW Wars and killed it</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/793327712/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/213900091/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/793327712/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Jason C</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> If you liked Speed 2: Cruise Control, you will like The Last Jedi.<br><br>If you like Star Wars films, you will not like The Last Jedi.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Lunar Landar"> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/901029763/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Lunar L</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="10"></span></div> They could slap the name Star Wars on a bucket of shit and make money.

If you\'re of a similar mind, then you\'re in for a treat.<br><br>Some fans derided The Force Awakens for being too similar to A New Hope. While The Last Jedi has elements that will remind fans of The Empire Strikes Back, the movie follows its own path and introduces surprise twists that virtually insure that Episode IX will be unlike any of its predecessors.<br><br>Addendum: There have been many fan reviews giving this movie 1/2 star and calling it every name in the book. These ridiculously negative reviews are not in keeping with either the critics\' reviews or the reviews of ANY Star Wars fans I know personally. Most of the really bad reviews seem to come from several camps:<br><br>(1) There are some fans out there who want ALL Star Wars films to be all about Luke, Han, and Leia, starring the original cast. I get it - we loved the original films and crave more, but their part in the story has already been told, and the torch has been passed on, just as it was (retroactively) passed between the prequels and the original trilogy. Sorry to say it, but Episodes VII-IX were NEVER going to be "all about the old gang", no matter WHO directed the films. If that\'s all you care to see, then fine - put Episodes IV-VI on auto-repeat.<br><br>(2) There are some extremists who are still butt-hurt that Disney scrapped the Expanded Universe, and so they will deem ANYTHING Disney does as "the worst film ever made". These people have no interest in posting honest reviews - they\'re basically pouting and throwing tantrums because they didn\'t get their way.<br><br>(3) Let us not forget the creatures known as Internet trolls, who exist to anonymously heap invective on anything they can. Plenty of those out there, many of whom are also in camp (2).<br><br>There are, I am certain, people out there who genuinely didn\'t like the movie for one reason or another, and that\'s fine: to each his own, as they say. For my part, I\'ll say this: I have thoroughly enjoyed A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, The Force Awakens, Star Wars: Rogue One and The Last Jedi and give them all grades from A- to A+. All had their flaws - none were perfect - but I enjoyed all of them immensely, unlike The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, or Revenge of the Sith, which I would grade D+, C- and B, respectively.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Thomas B."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977050367/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Thomas B</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> While graphically tremendously impressive, this movies\' curt dismissal of of the traditional values of enticing character arcs in favor of pseudo intellectual nihilistic blandness feels out of place. Completely erasing the original trilogy by doing a galactic reset makes every action in this film, and previous films, feel unimportant. Johnsons callous disregard for his source material is blatantly obvious. Consciously making fun of the Star Wars saga isn\'t meta or intellectual, it\'s just lazy. While the movie does try to convey a message of hope and potential in every living person, making rey so enormously overpowered counteracts this. When Rey defeats Kylo Ren in episode IX that will be the third time int three films she\'ll have bested him. Her arc builds up to nothing. TLJ fails to deliver on many points TFA set up, and not in a clever way. They are not subtly playing with audience expectation and subsequently surprising\xa0 them with a fresh and unexpected twist. Where you interested in Rey\'s heritage? Fuck you she\'s nobody. Where you intrigued by the allpowerful snoke? Well fuck you fans, he\'s just a thinly veiled James Bond villain rip-off thrown away for yet another "join me and we can rule the galaxy" rehash. Because fuck you, buy more porgs. The canto bight scene was hilarious, wrecking an insured casino and resort with horsedogs so the childslaves can clean it up later. But at least BB-8 got to shoot some coins. At points this movie is downright insulting to the intellect of it\'s viewers. Spaceships running out of fuel and literally stalling in space. IN SPACE. This being the biggest nerd franchise in the world you\'d think the writers would know about Newtons third law. No cruise control so we can have a dramatic sacrifice is pointless. Everyone in the first order is bewilderingly inept. Holdo being a renowned admiral and Dameron being the "best pilot in the resistance" don\'t know each other out of a crew of 200 people, give or take. Yet these two heroes of the resistance decide to distrust and turn on each other in the darkest hour. Just so we can have some forced drama. There are numerous ridiculous plot contrivancies layered throughout this flick, and the feeling that remains is Disney and Kennedy whispering in your ear "we don\'t care about star wars and neither should you". Thank you multibillion entertainment-empire, which is very closely approaching an monopoly, for telling me capitalism is bad. Thank you for relinquishing the very essence of Luke Skywalker in a forced "i\'m gonna kill my nephew because i totally don\'t talk people out of being evil" so you can sell toys of a Darth Vader look-alike with a crossguard on his lightsaber. All in all everything has been fantastic since Disney took over, can\'t wait for the han solo film nobody wants.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/827968935/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/1133070939/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/827968935/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Alexander B</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="20"></span></div> Visually stunning but that\'s about it.

TLJ is not a perfect film and the postmodern irrelevant subplot will annoy traditionalists, but the thrill of the new and the graceful exit of the old (my lord--it is good to see Yoda back on his game after the CGI horrors of the prequels) makes TLJ a lasting artistic contribution to the franchise.</div> </div> </div>']
