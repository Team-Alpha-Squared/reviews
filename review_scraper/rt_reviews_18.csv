Trying to sort through the last 2 and a half hours. This movie was franchise fuckery of the highest order. The same kind of fuckery we saw in the 2016 Ghostbusters. This film spent more time trying to push an ideological message than to answer any questions we were left with from TFA. Who\'s Snoke? Fuck you. Who are Rey\'s parents? Psh, why do you care? Here have some garbage feminist imagry, and a side-quest that grinds the film to a lull where we have the Black guy and Asian girl go to the planet with the "Worst people in the Galaxy," or Evil Old Rich White people who use child labor and abuse animals. Let\'s kill off all of the male commanders (except Poe, we\'ll just demote him) and now all the Resistant Commanders are female and led by a purple-hair lesbian (real subtle there Johnson). Oh and lets not forget the final stand off between the Resistance Ship and the First Order fleet. The Resistance are commanded by a group of strong willed womens who don\'t need no man. And the first order? Commanded by evil white dudes. Oh, and the setting for the final stand of the film seemed like Johnson laughing at 51% of the Audience hating it on Rotten Tomatoes as it\'s a planet where everything is salt. A soldier touches the ground and licks his finger and says "Salt?". Why? Because before this, you think they\'re on some kinda ice world like Hoth. And throughout this film, the message is pushed "The old must die." Well we clearly know what Disney and Johnson plan to do with this trilogy. Kill off every original character, and replacing them with characters they can mold into political ideological vomit spewers. My brother asked me if this film was bad enough he should wait to do a red box rental. I said "No, don\'t even give them your money. If you have to see it, pirate bay that shit." This is the worst thing to happen to Star Wars since the Christmas special.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/911107072/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/100000203345783/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/911107072/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Erik V</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> If you\'re a big starwars fan in the sense that the lore and story of episodes 1-6, and even #7, matter to you---I think you will be very disappointed with #8 "the last jedi".

I\'ve been a lifelong fan. I had all the action figures growing up (during the remastered original trilogy release). All the toys. I played the shit out of SWTOR, read expanded universe material (Shadows of the Empire, The Thrawn trilogy) and some graphic novels. Watched all of Clone Wars cartoon series (never got around to Rebels). I\'m a defender of the prequels. However, I will NOT be seeing the 9th entry of the Sykwalker series in theaters. Disneys has irrevocably ruined this universe. Luke Skywalker\'s character arc was completely destroyed (and made no sense), weaponized lightspeed negates all warfare in the universe as we\'ve known it, and none of the women in the movie eared their abilies/power (asian chick, purple-hair chick, Mary-Sue Rey, Mary-Poppins Leia). If I mentioned everything wrong with this movie I\'d be here all day and this post would be a novel. I will say, it looked awesome. That\'s the only kind thing I have to say. If you\'re distracted by shiny objects and don\'t care about the Star Wars Universe at all, then give this movie a watch. Otherwise, please don\'t give Disney your money. Rian Johnson can go to hell.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="M C."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977051856/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> M C</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="50"></span></div> One of my favorites.

The Last Jedi takes many of the complaints of the previous films and has a knee-jerk reaction, going so far the other way that the film has completely divided its faithful source of income, its fanbase.

Canto Bight was for the most part unnecessary / could have been done better, Rey\'s powers need serious explanation, but every other criticism I\'ve seen for the film can be explained away. <br>Finn / Rose: established at the beginning that Rose sees Finn as a hero. They have a fun (from the characters\' perspectives) adventure together. Rose experiences a whirlwind of emotion from the loss of her sister, hopelessness of the Resistance fleet, elation of being their potential saviour, being locked up in jail, freeing all the horse things, almost completing their mission, almost being killed, crash landing back with the Resistance, and being on the frontline suicide mission to stop the First Order. In one day she goes from being a technician to an adrenaline fuelled hero of the Resistance, the whole time joined by Finn. Of course she\'s gonna feel some strong emotions towards him by the end, and he clearly didn\'t kiss her back in that moment because he\'s not as overwhelmed as she is having experienced all of this before<br>Luke: having put a stop to the Empire and established his own order in peaceful (ish) times for about 20 years or so, one day it dawns on him that evil is back. and it\'s his nephew. he raised a school to be the next generation, he\'s old, he\'s already dealt with all this shit before, he\'s sick of his family turning evil, for a very brief moment he\'s consumed by darkness (just like that time he exploded at his dad and very almost killed him). this darkness lasts about 5 seconds, whereas last time it was a good couple of minutes. that\'s a pretty big improvement I\'d say, and even Luke Skywalker can\'t be a perfect man with no mistakes. anyway his mistake costs him his nephew, all his students, everything he\'s worked so hard to build for a couple of decades. makes sense to me that he\'d be sick of this shit and runs away from it all. from his perspective he\'s just created Vader 2, and he saw first hand what Vader 1 did. surprised he didn\'t kill himself after that tbh. as for the ending, it\'s already established that Rey couldn\'t be behind her and Kylo\'s link because she\'s "not powerful enough, it would destroy (her)". so to project oneself across the entire galaxy, to the entire resistance and first order troops, for so long, through the power of the mind, especially after only just reconnecting to the force after a good few years, is probably a SUPER hard thing to do<br>Holdo / Poe: Poe was demoted to captain after getting a load of people killed, he\'s in no authority to be disclosed every piece of information. simple as that<br>Snoke: Just like the Emperor in ep 5 &amp; 6, there was no time or relevance in this story to delve into who this guy is. There\'ll be a comic series or a book devoted to that, which all the hardcore fans can read because the average movie goer probably doesn\'t care that much anyways<br>Porgs: after the entire galaxy was saved by Ewoks, I\'m surprised there\'s anything said about the little things that did nothing major for the story other than making Chewie feel a little guilty. Course they were made to sell toys, but at least they weren\'t the reason the First Order was defeated<br>Timeline: Rey and Luke\'s arc was clearly picked up from the second TFA ended, but there\'s no reason to suggest there wasn\'t at least a week in between Rey leaving the Resistance and the First Order finding them. It\'s perfectly plausible that the chase sequence arc started a few days after the Rey / Luke arc, which also explains Finn\'s recovery<br>Super Leia: yeah, it looked dumb as hell. but it\'s always been established that Leia\'s in touch with the force, and despite other movies showing the opposite, it\'s scientifically accurate that you wouldn\'t die the second you enter space. Not that Star Wars needs to be, or has ever been entirely scientifically accurate. also when entering the ship again, the smoke when the door opens suggests an air lock to me. I\'d need to watch again to know if that\'s the case<br>Blue milk: the way I read this the very first time I saw it, was Luke staring into Rey\'s eyes to say "look how gross I am. fuck off"<br>Poe / Hux joke: Han did something very similar when they broke Leia out of detention cell 2187. Hux was dumb but it\'s been established outside of the movies that he gained his position because of his dad, and likes to take a back seat in war. He\'s supposed to be a pathetic slimy dirtbag <br>I\'ll admit, Phasma was a waste again, Kylo\'s abdomen injury was forgotten (or perhaps fixed offscreen because do you need to see every single detail?), some of the CGI was jarring, DJ was a whatever character and the tone was very distracting at times. But I\'d happily watch this movie every day if I had to and still enjoy it</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Martin%20 H."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977051737/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Martin%20 H</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> The film that finally killed Star Wars. <br><br>What can I say.

I had formed an opinion of Ruin Johnson after watching his most famous piece of work to date 2012\'s Looper. That opinion being that he has no original ideas in his storytelling. Decades ago when cars were not as sophisticated as they are today, crooked dealerships would create one new car by welding together two totalled cars and they were called cut\'n\'shuts. Ruin Johnson does this cut\'n\'shut technique with well known blockbusters. Taking the good stuff from Matrix, Terminator, Akira (manga) etc. And he distracts you with these selling points and the end result is you can remember what you thought going in to the movie but you sure don\'t remember the story arc of his film. All because he just cannot tell a good story! Soon as I heard they let him write his own story for Star Wars The Last Jedi I knew he was not up the the caliber of director such a movie deserves. This new generation of movie goers are satisfied with well done cgi and set pieces and the basic story telling is not of high importance. Star Wars just seriously deserved more than what a rookie director writer like Ruin Johnson</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977051740/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/2009344152666255/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977051740/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> As a fan of Star Wars for the past 20 years I could not be more disappointed in this car wreck of a production thanks a lot Disney you suck.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="RianJohnson J."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977051718/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> RianJohnson J</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="50"></span></div> I\'m a freakin\' GENIUS and you butt-hurt fanboys are pathetic losers!!<br><br>I created a Masterpiece thats too SUBTLE and too COMPLICATED for your tiny fanboy brains to comprehend!<br><br>You\'re all BIGOTS and FASCISTS who HATE DIVERSITY!!

It is not a Star Wars movie, but also as an stand alone movie, the plot is confusing and the characters have been flattened. <br>Nice visual effects, good actors, but is was a very shame that the direction and the story was so bad. A good chance missed! Too bad!</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Lelo S."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977051696/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Lorey S</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="20"></span></div> If you see this movie, you will be treated to really gorgeous effects and a great soundtrack, with solid performances by Mark Hamill and Adam Driver. There are many scenes and sequences that are exciting, and there are interesting new places and creatures. But overall, not much happens. Which just makes this a flashy, yet forgettable throwaway. And if you aren\'t a Star Wars fan, you can go see it on that basis and be relatively entertained. But for fans, this is a much more mixed proposition, and for a movie that is part of a series... it does not succeed. Any questions set up from the last movie (The Force Awakens) are dismissed with utter laziness from a story-telling perspective. The phrase from the trailer "this I not going to go the way you think" seems like a weapon aimed at assaulting Star Wars fans by giving them nothing to fulfill any expectations. Instead you get a ho-hum plot and incongruous character portrayals. The pace of the main action (chasing rebels through space) is slow and dull, and makes all the leaders (both rebel and first order) appear incompetent and absurd. There is also a habit of disrupting any true interesting tension being built in the story with the insertion of dumb jokes, negating any sense that any of it matters - making it hard to conjure up any real interest or investment in the story on the part of the viewer. The truly sad part is that this movie minimizes and subverts the old characters, especially Luke Skywalker. If the new characters grew or did anything interesting, perhaps you could forgive a bit. But that didn\'t happen either for the most part (Kylo perhaps being the exception). I think the filmmaker was aiming for "dark," but honestly the film is just depressing and certainly doesn\'t leave you wanting more. I think many fans will wish they had just stayed home to watch the old films and pretend this never happened.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="petejohnson0281"> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/974715765/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> peter j</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> Awful film.
