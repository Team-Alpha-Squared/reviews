However the music and the visual spectacles cannot redeem this film\'s plot. There were several holes in the plot, which I intend to discuss concisely.<br>1. C 3PO no longer has a red arm like he did in TFA.<br>2. The First Order conquered the galaxy in a few hours.<br>3. Rey received very little training from Luke and fought off several Praetorian Guards.<br>4. The First Order ships didn\'t light speed their way closer to the Resistance ships that were running out of fuel.<br>5. Vice Admiral Holdo refused to tell Poe her plans without cause which lead to a mutiny.<br>6. Leia is shown to be a powerful force user without any explanation.<br>7. Finn somehow beat Captain Phasma in a duel.<br>8. Kylo Ren was able to kill Snoke without Snoke sensing anything.<br>9. Kylo decided to destroy the Resistance without an explanation after he killed Snoke.<br>These are just a few of the many glaring plot holes in the story. Another gripe I have with the film is that Luke Skywalker is totally out of character without any good explanations. There was also a great deal of misplaced and quite cringy humour in the film. The film seemed to go out of its way to completely ruin mysteries from the TFA with unsatisfying answers or no answers. There were also several moments in the film where political agendas were obviously being pushed in annoying and obnoxious ways. There was incredibly little development of any of the new characters from TFA. While I am not a serious Star Wars fan I do watch the films quite often and this one feels totally out of place and weird. I don\'t know what Disney execs thought was so amazing about it and I don\'t particularly care, because I don\'t have to watch this film ever again.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977047234/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/10214468429117790/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977047234/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span>\xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="45"></span></div> There are, as with any film, issues with a few story choices here and there, but I think it\'s a great vehicle to advance the stories of most of the characters, and Luke\'s treatment is legendary.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977047138/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/580362088974656/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977047138/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="10"></span></div> I don\'t want to flesh this review out as I will be required to feel.

What this movie does is throw out 40 years of established concepts about how these characters operate, what they believe, and how they would react in certain situations. It would be like if they made a sequel to Bambi and you find out that grown up Bambi is up on assault charges and his girl friend is now a stripper. Hey- we\'re taking it in a new direction, right?<br><br>The plot is simplistic, the new characters unremarkable and superficial. Plus, it either minimized or straight up ignored all of the plot points that were left hanging in the previous movie. Watching this was like watching Sharknado, if Sharknado had been made with a hundred million dollar special effects budget.<br><br>Disney may have made a billion dollars with this thing, but as far as I\'m concerned, they\'ve also killed their golden goose. Walking out of the theater afterward was like leaving a disaster site. people were just kind of numb, like they couldn\'t believe what they had just seen. Since then, I haven\'t talked to a single person over 35 who liked it. As for me, I have zero interest in seeing the next one, and if Rotten Tomatoes is anywhere near accurate, I\'m not the only one who holds that opinion.<br><br>Disney may say publicly that they are thrilled with the direction the franchise is going, that the buzz is good, whatever. But in my industry, if a product got less than a 50% satisfaction rating, it would be scrapped or overhauled faster than the Millennium Falcon could make the Kessell run and the people responsible would be looking for a new job.<br><br>R.I.P.

The prequels felt more like Star Wars than the last Jedi did. During the film I was saying to myself this can\'t be right nothing feels like it should. I saw the force awakens twice in theaters and the last Jedi I won\'t even buy the blue ray it\'s that bad. No more of my money for you I say to the people who let this come to the big screen be smart Disney and hire a film student in college and you\'ll have a better Star Wars movie. P.

It wasn\'t great. But it wasn\'t awful. At the same time I left feeling bothered. A kind of itch in the back of my sensibility. Something I couldn\'t put my finger on. I thought about it all night and into the next day. So I decided I would write out the plot on paper to get out everything i still had in my memory bank. As I wrote I began to see more and more clearly the reasons why I felt the way I did. <br><br>I felt this way after the first 10 minutes of Aliens 3. I loved Alien and Aliens. Ripley had taken us on a compelling and exciting journey and we left feeling satisfied. I loved the characters that were left at the end of part 2. And then at the beginning of part 3, the writers kill off every beloved character and impregnate Ripley with an alien so she could die in the way she feared most. This is what The Last Jedi felt like. <br><br>I wont get into the caricatures they made of every character or the plot holes or the story inconsistencies. But they all exist. and I understand. I think i know why. I think we are at a unique point in history. We need more movies where all the women are heroes and martyrs and powerful. And we need more movies where men are shown to be men. reckless and angry and wishy washy and cowardly and power hungry and animal abusers and bullies. I believe there are ways to convey all of this. I think they tried but failed. <br><br>I will say that it was alot of fun to see visually. It was gorgeously shot. There were a few very creative ways they expanded the mythology and universe that i really appreciated. The action sequences were riveting. The lightsaber fights were amazing. So I will give it half a star for that. But I wish it was a different movie. I would say go see it and if you leave thinking it wasn\'t bad but it wasn\'t great, leave it there and don\'t overthink it.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Brad D."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977047197/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Brad D</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> Disappointed is an understatement.

I think Rian Johnson tried to make the movie unpredictable instead of good. And top it all off, he ruined Luke\'s character and didn\'t really given an explanation of how he became that way.

As a South American man I am not familiar with Social Justice warrior agendas or feminist political themes, it is not existent where I am from, so for you Americans to put that crap inside the movie and not even attempt to place it there subtly was an insult. Latin Americans dont care about your partisan politics, we want to see a good movie, a work of art, and the feminist men hating Kathleen Kennedy and her Beta male social justice warrior self loathing white man Rian Johnson destroyed a work of art. You know who else destroys works of art? ISIS, you people are no better than ISIS, a bunch of privileged culture destroyers. Funny how you add anti-capitalist elements in the film when you people profit from capitalism, Disney is the epitome of capitalism yet they try everything to destroy it. It is an absolute epitome of mental illness. <br><br>Everybody hates these movies, blacks, whites, Mestizos, Indians, Chinese, they all have the same feelings I have, you destroyed the Star wars Lore, you destroyed the essence of Star wars, stop assuming only white males hated it, I am not white, and I despised it just like many other non-white males. Even females hated it. Stop destroying a cultural medium of unity, Star Wars brings all of us together, to have our minds traverse a galaxy far far away, we dont need to be reminded of yanks PC politics, okay? Star Wars is dead, unless you erase it from cannon, the next movie will bomb.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/807772501/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/533370250/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/807772501/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Ian M</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span>\xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="25"></span></div> Visually - it\'s amazing looking. Story wise it just doesn\'t satisfy. I understand being different but I don\'t think this was the different fans were hoping for. I\'m still excited for Ep 9 because I have no idea what they are going to do with that. I don\'t believe Disney is trying to ruin Star Wars but they are just figuring out how to do these films and they\'ll keep getting better.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/789754603/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/583525505/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/789754603/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Eddie D</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> Rian Johnson ruined Star Wars!</div> </div> </div>']
