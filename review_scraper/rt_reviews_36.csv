Dressing gowns and make shift lightsabers took me and my brother on many an adventure. I absolutely loved the original trilogy (and yes the prequels too) Darth Vader was truly scary villain and Luke the most valiant of hero\'s. He was an idol for me and many others growing up in those early days, when tv hero\'s actuelly made an impact on peoples lives and genuinely were role model\'s. So when episode 7 came around I was exited to see the saga I loved so much continue, it met pretty much all of my expectations with that unmistakable star wars feel, new interesting characters and pondering rich plot Lines. So after waiting now 2 years to find out where 7\'s literal cliffhanger would take us and to finally see my childhood hero now the fully developed and powerful Jedi Master he would undoubtably have become. Then episode 8 happened! and I\'ve got to say it was bad, I mean really bad! JJ Abraham\'s had set up an amazing new villain in Snoke and a real keep you guessing back story in Rey both of which Ryan Johnson took absolutely nowhere! And gave absolutely nothing to the fans that had been eagerly anticipating the growth of these characters and their storylines! But what got me the most was what they did with Luke Skywalker?! I mean they must have wanted to Sabotage the character and his Legacy, because there\'s no way you would desecrate a well established and beloved character that way unless it was on purpose.<br>As for the main plot for me it was a completely stagnant and just a bit lazy.<br>Thanks for reading and may the force be with you.<br>#Notmyluke</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="James C."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/976976777/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> James C</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span>\xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 12, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="15"></span></div> So it feels like there was some kind of burning platform moment during production. Things felt completely rushed and it was like "what do we do?" <br><br>Feels like hasty decisions were made. I think a "pause" would have been in order. Corporations frequently get themselves into trouble this way - driving towards a deadline and sacrificing quality along the way. I would have been completely fine if Disney, for one reason or another said "look, we want to get this right and are pushing back the date 6 months, 1 year, 2 years whatever." Kathleen has said this before - the need to get it right.<br><br>There are things that were good about the movie and things that were not so good. I completely understand that Disney needs to build a bridge to the newer generation. The problem here is that it seems like the younger generation was looked at in a vacuum. We are the parents of the newer generation, the ones "building the magic" at home for these movies, the ones taking them to the movies, the ones buying them presents and memorabilia for these movies. <br><br>I think this may have been missed. Now we have a situation where many parents have a bitter taste in their mouths and sure we will take the kids to the next one, but we are not going to help build the brand anymore. <br><br>Now Disney may respond "we don\'t need your help building a brand, we are doing just fine thank you." <br><br>Not true - brand building taps the deeper and emotionally levels of individuals. Think about it - how many of us still have the hair on the back of our neck stand up when Binary Sunset plays? That was not just the movies - it was everything, our parents discussing the movies with us, our parents setting up scenes and playing with us, playing the music in the background, the toys under the tree. <br><br>That is what many parents were building with their children through the Force Awakens. We were recreating that magical experience in our households (My daughter would stop what she was doing when Rey\'s Theme would play in our house). It was organic - not "forced".<br><br>I am sad for ourselves and our children - as after this many of us will view Star Wars as just another movie. And I am sad for Disney as well; hopefully this was not a future business school case study on how to kill a brand- time will tell.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Ange A."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977048665/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Ange A</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 12, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="10"></span></div> The MOST disappointing stars wars movie to date.

Rian Johnson was at least a competent writer/director and I had some hopes. But The Last Jedi has severe script issues, severe pacing issues that stem from the poor script, severe editing issues that stem from the poor script, severe character issues including lack of development of pertinent characters and introduction to unnecessary characters, all of which derive from the poor script. The directing was lackluster and failed to evoke any of the great cinematic language that we\'ve seen and learned from over the last 90 years. There was no great camera composition, telling us important information through framing and movement. There was no powerful, unique editing. The reactions of some of the prominent characters upon seeing one another was like a TV soap opera; everything just felt poorly directed and poorly thought out. Many plot points took up valuable screen time and then were thrown away. In addition, this was pretty much a copy of Empire, which is ironic given the underlying theme this film seems to be preaching, which is "Leave the past; bury it, and move on."<br><br>As an experiment, consider the two stories of Empire: Luke goes to Dagobah to seek Yoda and be trained. Han &amp; Leia run from the Empire and develop a relationship. THAT\'S IT. Tight, focused, easy. The characters we love have a boffo action-packed opening and part ways, then the business of the plot happen as both stories develop naturally, and then everything converges like magic to Cloud City, where everyone is almost reunited but beloved Han has been taken away. It\'s simple. It\'s effective. It works... because there\'s no filler, nonsense, pandering-to-China-box-office, painful Star-Trek-V-level-corny humor and undeveloped character motivations clogging up the works. Instead, we get plenty of screen time for us to see Luke develop and sow the seeds of both his doubt in himself and his loyalty to his cause. And we get to see plenty of screentime as Han &amp; Leia realize they don\'t just need each other, they NEED each other. And it\'s all due to Vadar\'s relentless pursuit. We all know the danger, we all know what\'s at stake. We need NO exposition, save for the opening crawl, and we\'re set. That\'s the sort of efficiency that a decent story can provide. You run with it and let your actors and your talented DP, composer and crew create the magic inside of it.<br><br>The Last Jedi has very, very little of this, and instead feels like a Verbinski-helmed Pirates Of The Carribean sequel: overbloated, overstocked, overwritten, over-everything. It needed four plotlines, three characters and forty minutes cut out of it. There is a seed of a good story in this movie. But it cannot be found amidst the riff raff.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977048651/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/726045630/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977048651/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 12, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> Didn\'t expect it to be so Bad.

My ultimate conclusion is that this movie is crap. They took the best things about Star Wars and TFA and made the worst decisions imaginable. I saw every Star Wars in the theater since ROTJ at least twice and this one I will not even rent/buy let alone watch a second time in the theater. I won\'t even see Episode IX unless I hear JJ fixed all this crap storytelling by Rian Johnson. I like Looper and his other movies just fine, so I had high hopes that this movie would be decent. The previews made it look awesome, but the details in between ruined it. My mother, who I saw it with, even didn\'t like it after liking all the others. And she is not a big Star Wars fan at all. I don\'t think Rian or those other people who approved this movie even saw TFA. SPOILERS AHEAD!<br><br>The first thing they ruined was Luke Skywalker. The most powerful Jedi left the Resistance a map to find him. For what? Rian\'s version of Luke states he just wanted to hide from everyone. THEN WHY LEAVE A MAP? Then we get that Luke tried to kill Ben Solo in his sleep....but the version changes 3 times during the movie, so I was confused whether he or Kylo is the bad guy. Plus, Luke would NEVER kill a kid who seems evil. I was pumped when it looked like Luke would destroy the First Order walking out the cave at the end, but no....Let\'s make him have a moment with Leia, absorb all the firepower from the new AT-ATs and brush it off like a bad ass, dodge a few blows from Kylo, and then show he was really never there to begin with. WTF?!!!!!!! Then he dies from exhaustion (or peace with the force or whatever)?! WTF?!!!!!!!!!!!! Luke ended up being a total hermit and a normal old grumpy person.<br><br>The second is with the new characters. Rey was good in TFA, but she is shown to be a total badass without any training or experience whatsoever. She cannot lose to anything and is brought up as have an important past. Nope....Rian shits all over that too by stating she is No One. This is not Game of Thrones Rian. I could see past her perfection is she was Luke\'s daughter biologically or Leia\'s, but just drunkards who sold her for money shows me you were lazy with storytelling and went with a crappy backstory there. JJ did not mean for her to be nobody based on TFA. As for Finn and Poe, you might as well have just thrown them in the garbage. Finn has a useless role in the entire movie up until the very end. Let him make that sacrifice and I would have respected his character. No, Rose has to save him at the last minute. Then she kisses him and dies (at least that was what I thought, but most people say she passed out). Sloppy storytelling there! Poe is made to look like a hotshot idiot and I actually hate his character after watching this movie. Laura Dern (don\'t know her SW name) should have just said I have a plan and you don\'t need to know it right now. Captain Phasma is just a waste of Gwen\'s talent and should not even be in the movie if that is all they would do with her.<br><br>Third, Leia was good. The flying bit was unexpected and silly. I thought they decided to kill her character there, although it seemed too soon. She should have replaced Laura Dern\'s character at the end for a self-sacrifice. Leia lives at the end...yet didn\'t Disney state they had to change the ending for her character since Carrie died? WTF?!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>Fourth, Kylo Ren is a whiny teenager who gets no respect and wants to bully everyone. I liked his arc in TFA, but he is just pitiful here. Darth Vader would do circles around him and spanked him with a force push. I actually liked the helmet Kylo wore, but he doesn\'t have it now. Also, what about the Knights of Ren?! Nowhere to be found......<br><br>Lastly, the worst decision was to kill off Snoke. WHY?!!!!! He was the best and most interesting character throughout until that cheap parlor trick by Kylo. Snoke can do almost everything better than the Emperor according to the story telling, but you kill him easily in the 2nd movie of the trilogy? WTF?!!!!!!!!!!! Who is left to actually be a good character to push the next movie forward? Not Kylo.<br><br>In summary, it was an okay Syfy movie. BUT, not a good Star Wars movie at all. It is making money because we all went to see it thinking it would be awesome, but it is just the opposite. I truly have no idea how the critics could have liked this trash unless they wanted Star Wars to fail. Reboot this movie with JJ at the helm please.</div> </div> </div>']
