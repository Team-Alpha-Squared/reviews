I was bored at the incredulous and lazy script within 10 minutes. I rate it at 2 out of 5 on that basis. However if you are a StarWars fan and/or want to experience this as part of a bigger story it is even worse. Great actors. Dazzling effects. Beautiful soundtrack. Unique and invaluable legacy of the earlier films (including Episode 7 which was pretty good). All trashed by disastrous script, storytelling and editing. I cannot understand how this is even possible. Has Disney just bought the single film franchise with the most potential and trashed it? No coming back from this one I\'m afraid Disney....This film has turned most fans and film lovers off StarWars for good.

Regretfully the Last Jedi has fails to maintain continuity with the Star Wars Universe, with in the trilogy to which it belongs, but most importantly within the movie itself. The premises for the story and the plot devices are simply not believable and poorly thought out. There are entire sequences which could easily be edited out with no loss to the story. The characters are not very engaging and it is hard to see how they are going to evolve. The protagonist herself has no more growing or development to do. The villains have no real presence. Admittedly the movie is in a fantasy setting, but some realism and consistency in the physics of the movie does help in the immersion of the audience. Perhaps the director should have consulted with his local high school physics teacher early on in the production.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977054755/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/797985013745830/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977054755/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 15, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> + nice graphics<br>+ good work of John Williams <br><br>- RUINED THE IMAGE OF LUKE SKYWALKER<br>- messed up story ( even worse then episode I II III )<br>- waste of characters<br>- waste of new charaters<br>- the have no rules anymore<br>- plot holes <br>- plot holes<br>- plot holes<br>- POOOORGS</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/976767608/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/10214132139883348/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/976767608/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span>\xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 15, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="25"></span></div> What a disgrace.

The more I think about the movie the more dissapointed I find my self. I am sure I will just parrot many others but I there were just so many things wrong for me. Seems like the new director just shat on everything JJ set up in episode VII, starting with Luke throwing his sword away and that trend continues through out the whole movie. I won\'t even get into all the blatant agendas that were shoved down pur throats in a fantasy movie ... that being said, I am still cheering for SW and I hope the next one will be better.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Kamil K."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977054714/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Kamil K</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 15, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> Good things:<br>1. Visuals. <br>2. Actors play. Good performances especially of Adam Driver, Mark Hamilton, Daisy is not so bad at all but she could ride her convoluted always-look of confusion - it is not even matching her character of being independent. Suprisingly, even the characters were pissing me off, the actors did the best. This is what everyone can agree to be honest.<br><br>Bad things.<br>1. Plotholes.<br>2. Unnecessary b-plots (like Canto Bright)<br>3. There is no logic in this movie. Bombs pulled off vertically because there is gravity in space, Leia blowed up to the space and then flying back to the ship with force.<br>4. Twist-over-twist. I think the critics like the film because it subverts all your expectation. Who is Snoke? Meh, nobody. He got killed by a brat who is supposed to be the next intimidating villain. Haha, I do not get it and I am not excited. Who are Knights of Ren? Meh, who cares. So you have to say, its subverting ALL expectation a good thing itself? Well, if you cannot write a story that is consistent, definitely not. It is easy to subvert expectations just by not telling anything.<br>5. Deconstruction and destruction of Luke Skywalkers character. The symbol of good, honesty and HOPE (Episode IV\'s name "The New Hope" was not in vain!) turns out to be grumpy, whiny douchebag. He tried - against all the hope and all people - turn his father to good knowing he is a mass murder. But just sensing that could be darkness in his nephew - son of his sister and best friend with whom he gone to the war - he said - e, f*ck it, lets kill him. <br>6. Ideology. There is so obvious propaganda in this film and it is served with every second line. Anticapitalism, pacifism, animal rights, children rights, forced diversity among the cast, feminism: all important position on Rebels side are held by women, wiceadmiral Holdo bashing Poe Dameron for having overtestosteron dose, all white men are a) fascist yelling at everyone around, b) life failures (starting with Han Solo who made divorce with his wife and left his child). When you have put ideology like that - at least be subtle and do it with consistency and artistry. <br>7. There is no difference at all - there is no originality. Just because The Last Jedi does not tell anything about main points made in TFA and subvert this way all expectation of the fans - but is not originall at all. Crate is nothing like Hoth (I suspect that in original cut of the movie this was the beginning of the film), Dreadnought is nothing like Superdestroyer, Luke is living like a hermit just as Yoda did, Rey is new Luke, Imperium chase the ship(s) of Rebels, we have speeders fighting on Hoth, pardon, Crate. The same old, but with new merchandising creatures and just edited in slight different order. <br>8. Sense of humor and merchandising creatures - Disney at its best. I must say, nothing like plotholes, lack of logic, lack of motivations was telling me to leave the cinema before end like this retarded attempts to be funny. Yo mama jokes in Star Wars? Luke and cow with blue alcoholic milk? No.<br>9. One of the main arch in movie is the chase of imperial ships trying to get the rebels ship. This was so slow and lacking of any logic I could spent five hours to telling how stupid it was. Why the imperium ship did not just make jump into hyperspace once and then jump again to get closer to the rebels? Why not call for help the other parts of the fleet? <br>10. Rose character. When you saw the film you know why. It is not of surprise than the Chinese people turn against the film. If Rose character was to catch the chinese audience it was doing in the most insulting way possible, because Rose is dump retarded idiot that was used to express ideology and not to make any sens at all. And Chinese are people with commons sense and they did not buy it and this is why in the second week the revenue of TLJ was dropped in China by 94%. <br>You could say the same for the Afroamericans, the film tries to be diverse, but honestly, Finn was no less idiot than Rose. He had a chance for being hero, but the Rose destroyed it by... flying into his ships and make dumbest comment ever. When Finn was a white male from my country, I would be feel offened by the way Disney has seen me.

The Last Jedi did not honor Star Wars legacy at all. The biggest thing I could see was a giant middle finger to The Force Awakens. It mockingly destroys every plot point brought up before this movie.<br><br>Don\'t get me wrong, the movie wasn\'t horrible it\'s just that it wasn\'t good either. The visuals were stunningly beautiful and the sound was excellent. The plot, or lack of, is the biggest problem. The writing was also lazy and horrible.<br><br>Was there a feminist agenda? Some people claim yes. If there was, they did a really bad job of it. All the women in TLJ were horribly written and very shallow. <br><br>Luke Skywalker - Badass Jedi? Nope, grumpy old man that doesn\'t believe in good any more. I get that Disney wants to move forward and leave the original characters behind. That\'s fine. But if Luke is going to die, why couldn\'t he really fight Kylo Ren and be defeated by the Dark Side? THAT, would have been good controversy. <br><br>Rey - Badass woman, because you know, magic. She had known about the Force for all of 3 days and can beat a guy that has trained for YEARS with the most badass Jedi of all time, and also trained at least a little by Snoke. She is a nobody from nowhere? Fine, nothing wrong with that. But knowing things by magic is just poor and lazy writing.<br><br>Poe Dameron - Best pilot in the galaxy? But he\'s bad and stupid because he is a man. Retarded logic. At least he was actively trying to save the Rebellion/Resistance.<br><br>Finn - Also bad and stupid because he is a man. This leads to the pointless subplot, why? The only thing it accomplishes is more woe for the Rebels. Lazy writing.<br><br>Kylo Ren - Probably the only good character in the entire movie. He is emotional and unstable, that\'s great. I actually like that. It flows with the plot that he was turned or seduced by the Dark Side.<br><br>Leia - wow, what a shake my head character in this movie. She can survive the vacuum of space and Mary Poppins back to the ship because... she is a woman and needs no explanation. It\'s almost a disgrace to the memory of Carrie Fisher. I mean she passed while this movie was being made. That would have been an excellent time to write her out of the story with dignity.<br><br>Admiral Purple Hair - Commander of the Rebels... because she is a woman. Good leaders do just that, lead. Subordinates trust them and follow orders. She had a disregard for Poe because he was a man. There was no need to let her people know the plan? That only created more havoc than good. <br><br>Captain Phasma - Good lord! Why hire an actress like Gwendolyn Christie and not use her? There was so much potential there! Again, I think this was a knee to the groin of The Force Awakens. She was on screen for less time than TFA!<br><br>Chewbacca - I\'m surprised they didn\'t kill him too.<br><br>C3PO - What happened to the red arm?<br><br>R2D2 - one of the only truly great scenes in the movie, which was also just a rehash/replay of A New Hope.<br><br>Admiral Akbar - dies (?) off screen, nothing to see here...<br><br>Rose - almost a good character, but involved in the pointless subplot. She stops Finn from sacrificing himself for the greater good because "to win save the ones you love, not kill the things you hate." Great message, but you just killed all of your Rebel buddies because the cannon now fires on the base. And love? They knew each other for like what, 12 hours?<br><br>Terrible, terrible lazy writing. <br><br>The Good<br>* Visuals, sets, and sound<br>* Finding the map that leads to Luke<br>* The Force connection between Kylo and Rey<br>* Force projection<br><br>The Bad<br>* Pointless subplots<br>* Poor writing, script, dialog<br>* Casino planet<br><br>The Ugly<br>* Seacow Alien Milk<br>* Poorly timed jokes and one-liners<br>* Snoke - unimportant bad guy<br>* Luke\'s heart attack</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977054664/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/10155308539947781/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977054664/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 15, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="10"></span></div> Hugely disappointed that this seems to have been a missed chance. TFA created so many great characters to be further developed and questions that were yelling to be answered and it is as if TLJ film creators looked at all the great fan theories and said wouldn\'t it be funny if we just said none of it really mattered! With gender, race, equality and corporation issues shown to us on a daily basis, it didn\'t need to be so overly brought over and emphasized in a galaxy far far away. The creators seem to have brought modern prominently young sociaties issues and layered them throughout this film that in the end it looks like Star Wars but no longer feels like the Star Wars. Kylo Ren says \'let the past die, kill it if you have too\' which should have been the films tagline as well as a warning to all long-standing Star Wars fans to let go of all your nostalgia for the previous films or this movie will kill it for you.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Jeff M."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977002609/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Jeff M</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 15, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> Breaks cardinal rules of cinema by waisting audiences time.

Plot holes <br>2. Again changing how the force works to coincide with Rey being the almighty MAREY SUEEEEEe I mean the force is being treated with anime levels of fuckery here. <br>3. Completely destroying luke\'s character, ignoring the entire arc he went through in the OT to the point that even Mark Hamill said "I completely disagree with what you\'ve done with this character" <br>4.GlorifiedChaseSequence.mp4 <br><br>Other shit that\'s wrong with it is SPOILERS REEEEEEEEE <br><br><br><br><br>5. Snoke is completely wasted as a potential villain, we learn nothing about him other than that he can use the force like an anime power <br>6. The knights of Ren are completely disregarded as a potential plot point and barely possibly mentioned once <br>7. Daisy ridley continues to be unable to act her way out of a paper bag <br>8. Leia acting like superman with the force <br>9. Terrible writing which coincides with that most if not all of the characters are pants on head retarded in their motivations. <br>10. no lightsaber duel and that stupid AF astral projection shit does not fucking count <br>11. Lukes death is the dumbest shit ever, and is just a sign of how disney doesn\'t want to shill out the money for the high profile actors, and if Carrie fisher hadn\'t died, then she would have been killed in this movie or the next. <br>12. Choreography is a fucking joke yet again. <br>13. Daisy ridley again because I hate her.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="G L."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977054625/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> G L</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 15, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="50"></span></div> Kept me guessing all the way.
