The glowing reviews done by the majority of "professional" critics looks like some repugnant fetish for anything "subversive," no matter how clumsily, poorly thought out, and defacing to the original property the "subversion" is. Subversion can be a great thing when it\'s skillfully done. It isn\'t here.<br><br>This is a bad movie. It\'s tempting to focus on the poor pacing, overly long run time, plot holes, and general aura of incompetence the characters labor under (Holdo keeping her plan secret despite knowing the Resistance fighters are in a desperate situation and badly demoralized; the amazingly inept plan to go to the casino planet that felt stupidly circuitous the moment it was spoken, let alone executed, in the movie, etc.)<br><br>But while its tempting to look at those things, which make it a bad watch, the worst thing about it is simply Rian Johnson\'s decision that time and old age had made Luke into essentially the opposite of what he was, to the point where the audience feels disgust with a person they were fond of. Luke is an apathetic jerk. It may subvert audience expectations, but only because it demonstrates a complete disrespect for the original trilogy that birthed the franchise.<br><br>Finally, this movie doesn\'t just damage the original trilogy, it also retroactively makes the Force Awakens look like a time bomb of bad ideas that have now gone off. The decisions to have the First Order just replace the Empire, Snoke replace the Emperor, Luke replace Obi Wan as a Jedi who taught a corrupted pupil... it all undermined the accomplishments of the first films, but at least the audience believed we\'d get a serious and intelligent effort in the Last Jedi to answer the questions of how that happened. No such effort was made. Force Awakens was derivative and never thought two steps ahead. The Last Jedi cements that no effort was put into thinking those things through, while taking a seemingly perverse pleasure in tainting whatever fond feelings you still had for Luke Skywalker.<br><br>I\'d prefer to give this movie zero stars if I could, but since the lowest score you can give is half a star, I\'ll say that the half-star goes to the music, which remains stellar (John Williams has never disappointed with any soundtrack, the soundtrack is the only good thing to come out of this movie).</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Honk M."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977047019/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Honk M</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> Wow. I suspected I wasn\'t going to like this chapter of the Star Wars saga but I had no idea it would wind up spraying figurative fecal matter over my appreciation for the whole series. It is just so very bad in every regard expect for the visual. No logic, rhyme or reason to anything. No room for it I guess, with all the PC crap jam packed in there. Who knew a light speed engine on a hulk of metal was the ultimate anti ship weapon all along? Who knew you could open doors into space and simply pull stuff in from the other side. Why not simply ban white men from the franchise altogether (except for roles as evil clowns of course) and be done with it? You\'re not fooling anyone you know. Oh and throw in some more cute critters while you\'re at it. And choke on \'em.

Of course not but it didn\'t make it better or worse. just whatever. People are pointing fingers at the die-hards like our expectations were too high Maybe but I argue that\'s Disney\'s fault for marketing the movie the way they did. JJ already created intriguing mysteries that were changing he Star Wars lore. I don\'t know why critics are defending this movie saying sw fans don\'t want anything new. Are you kidding me? We\'ve been waiting for something new FOREVER. It\'s obvious that they didn\'t have a game plan for this franchise. I\'ll still see episode 9 but I don\'t know if I care considering what they did to snoke. The fans have been waiting for some backstory on this foool since day one and they trolled us. The worst part is they\'d knew we\'d be upset but did it anyways. I was nervous about jj coming back but now maybe not. If story continuity is synonymous with fan service then I\'ll take a fan service movie.

Then Rian Johnson walks into the room. He grabs the ships out of your hand and opens the top bay doors. He proceeds to drop his drawers and piss into the toy a few feet in front of your face.

Then just when you think he is done, Rian turns around and takes an actual dump inside the Falcon. Rian mercifully exits the room.<br><br>Despite feeling completely mortified and scarred by the experience, you gather yourself together and approach you cherished, childhood toy to assess the damages. Then, just as you start to get a new hope that the Falcon can somehow be cleaned up, Kathleen Kennedy and the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Gang from Disney come into the room and start stomping the Falcon into smithereens like it\'s a Friggin HOT DIGGITY DOG jamboree! <br><br>Holding back tears at this point, The Horror just continues.

Business ethics at its finest here. <br><br><br>Visual effects, and sound effects were stunning. There are a couple of cool action sequences in the movie as well. Otherwise, I\'d like to forget that I saw such a poorly crafted movie. I grew up watching star wars movies, playing with the toys, playing the video games, reading the literature, etc. This movie did not do justice to any of the original characters or newly created characters from TFA. <br><br>Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy have either never watched a star wars movie or were dedicated to destroying it. Johnson and Kennedy failed to create any scenes without breaking them up with forced slapstick humor, there were plot holes that my 9-year-old pointed out, cringe-worthy moments like Leia Poppins, more unnecessary throw away characters than you can count, zero character development, and forced SJW side-quest to justify useless Rose. <br><br>Furthermore, every man in this movie is either pathetic or incompetent. Thanks Kathleen Kennedy!! Keep telling your predominantly male fan-base how much they suck!! Finn is a cowardly defector, Poe is a reckless "flyboy," Luke is an incompetent jerk, DJ (Del Torro) is a backstabbing scumbag, and Hux and Kylo are just angry immature man-children. <br><br>SW is dead.

There are writing errors through out that are tough to detect but once you start to see them they become glaringly obvious. I wanted to like this film so much; but I am afraid that all it did for me is drag my opinion of it\'s predecessor The Force Awakens down with it. The films are supposed to be connected but Rian seemingly decided to throw the baby out with the bath water and do his own thing. Being a Star Wars fan since I was a child in the early 80\'s this is the first Star Wars film that I did not have an over all good time watching; including the prequels.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977046948/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/1960830357265982/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977046948/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> Dog shit of the year award goes to Kathleen Kennedy and Ruin Johnson.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Gus M."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977046855/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Gus M</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> Worst Star Wars movie ever...Star wars is dead</div> </div> </div>']
