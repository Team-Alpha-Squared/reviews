 Watched it, horrible. poorly written, took away everything that made the past Star Wars films great. The main past characters got trashed, the new characters are flawed, even the new fighter designs with compressor engine blades that split in half show just how poorly thought out the new franchise is. pure dribble compared to the past shows, ticket sales and toys sales tanking for a reason., ni,  Jeff B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/951028791/
 Luke vs rey and Luke vs kylo was good also kylo and rey vs protorian guards and ports ofcourse, 5.0,  Biscky D, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977056266/
 Honesty was the worst star wars movie a huge disappointment. Plot holes left and right., 1.0,  Gabriel H, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/895533337/
 I cannot believe that I am saying this, but, THE LAST JEDI is worse than PHANTOM MENACE. I never thought I would say that about another Star Wars Movie. This movie had a total disrespect for the original characters. But even if none of the original cast were in this movie, it is still a terrible story with ridiculous plot holes. They push a progressive political message. All the women are leaders and strong, all the men are either evil, stupid, or weak. I think Rian Johnson believes he is a woman, and one day he is going to announce he is transgender. The critics giving great reviews are obviously Progressives as well and/or terrified of Disney., 0.5,  Frank C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977056247/
 it is an... -ok- movie; im realizing that these movies are being made for a newer generation, not the people who were kids when the original trilogy came out. that makes sense. im sort of done i think, with sw. though, Rogue One was excellent., 2.0,  MARK%20 P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977056253/
 I wanted to like it, but it gave me too many reasons to question the plot and sub plots. It was not as good as the last two., 2.0,  Scott R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/710784925/
 Good Stuff-<br>Action Scenes: Fantastic fight scenes in and out of space<br>Sound and CGI: Great CGI and soundtrack<br>Bad Stuff-<br>Acting: Stiff and wooden<br>Plot holes are everywhere<br>and finally, the last straw for me was the damnation of Mark Hamill's character Luke Skywalker., 1.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977001207/
 After TFA, I was kind of worried that nuWars would supplant Star Wars in peoples' hearts and minds. Would the Resistance replace The Rebellion? Would the First Order replace the Empire? Would BB-8 replace R2?<br><br>After the dumpster fire that was TLJ I realized I need not have worried. Rian Johnson took what was a guaranteed home run, and tripped over his own dick. Instead of a movie, I got a 2+ hour PSA on feminist and anti-capitalist ideology - from the freaking evil empire Disney no less!, 0.5,  Brody R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/974275634/
 Similar to The Force Awakens, this might be a movie I'll have to re-evaluate once the trilogy is concluded. As it stands now, I liked it. But I did have problems with it, and more problems that are hard to ignore and more than The Force Awakens.<br>I'm just going to get the bad stuff out of the way. Finn's arc is pointless. It builds the universe more and gives some interesting commentary, but it felt really unnecessary. When it comes to the main story, there are some plot points that were built up and just dropped off a cliff. Rey's parentage actually didn't bother me, I kinda' liked it, but Snoke's role here just pissed me off. It felt like an attempt to be unexpected and edgy but instead it just came off like a disrespect for the mythology that was being created. The biggest problem though is how small the movie can feel. We're following the final remnants of the rebellion, but considering where the last film left off I find that kind of hard to believe. Additionally, this makes things feel very limited. Force Awakens had a lot of repeat, but the task they were facing felt huge. Here, they're really just running and trying to survive. That could be huge, the last flashes of the rebellion trying to survive, that could be big, but it never feels that big.<br>I only give Star Wars crap because I love it so. And the thing is, despite all its flaws, I did still like this entry. It is the next chapter in these character's stories, and even if the plot has issues the characters still work. I like seeing Luke again, even if he is older and grumpier he's still Luke. Finn and Rey are still enjoyable as our new leads, and Rey in particular goes through some serious stuff in this entry and I was totally invested in her journey. There's also some really solid action scenes, including a fight with those red guards who we never before got to see fight that is just awesome to witness.<br>The Last Jedi gives us a lot of awesome stuff, but it doesn't give enough of what I wanted to see. Still, if I'm distinguishing between what I wanted and what I got, what I got was still mostly solid. It's not perfect, and its flaws really bug me, but the characters are still great and it still feels like classic Star Wars. It leads the franchise in a direction I'm not sure what to expect from. Force Awakens brought things back on track, and The Last Jedi sends things in an unexpected direction. With where things end here, I am for the first time with Star Wars completely unsure of what to expect next, and honestly that's pretty exciting., 4.0,  Michael M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/795650964/
 what an absolute waste of time watching this was, 0.5,  Ian G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/957247463/
 The political overtones set forth by the last two movies were taken to extremes on this episode. Plus, the movie trashes the legacy of the original trilogy. Not a very bright future for the franchise., 1.5,  Samuel L, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/898144824/
 I love Star Wars. This was not good Star Wars. The more I think about Rian Johnsons reasoning behind what motivates the characters in this installment the more upset I get. For example, Rose crashing into Finn cuz he was sacrificing himself for the greater good (love) and then telling him the resistance will only win by doing things out of love left me dumbfounded. During multiple moments while watching the movie I remember wondering if a teenager wrote the script and purposely cut out everything that we were looking forward to just to say, "Gotcha". Yes, JJ Abrams left a lot of mystery boxes from "The Force Awakens" for Rian to answer but Rian decided to answer barely anything and if he did I was only left with disappointment. If I could give this review zero stars I would. I honestly wish this movie would be retracted by Disney but they just made so much money off of this low IQ film. I don't even care to see episode IX or the upcoming Solo movie. Disney and Lucasfilms (*cough Kathleen Kennedy cough*) are not giving the true Star Wars fans, who care about EU and lore, the movie that they deserve., 0.5,  Joshua B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977013948/
 I am 56 years old. I remember standing in line for hours to see this movie in 1977. Never before was there a line blocks long to get into a movie. Once you were in the theater it was a celebration but when the crawl began it became quiet and an almost spritual experience. The crowd held onto their seats and were enthralled. I was inspired. I wanted to be as good as Luke. I have loved the force all my life. You FUCKERS!!! What they did to the Skywalker name is a disgrace. Anyone who watched the 3 original movies KNOWS Luke is an honorable and faithful JEDI that goes to the core of his VERY EXISTENCE. NO WAY does he become the crumudgeon who yells at kids who cross his yard and suckles green tit milk. It must be Rian's fantasy. It is not mine. It is not any true Star Wars believer's either. Maybe if your a baby or into that kind of shit you will enjoy it. As for me, and MILLIONS of others, we're OUT. This did not happen, 0.5,  Karen R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977056087/
 Neither me nor my son enjoyed this movie., 1.0,  Silent S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977056134/
 Not only was the premise painfully stupid the way that Rian Johnson ruined the Star Wars mythology made the film hard to watch. Additionally he took one of the most important and brave characters (Luke Skywalker) and made him a bubbling, sniveling, wimp. <br><br>Hopefully JJ Abrams can save the disaster that Johnson has made., 0.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977056105/
 Star wars the last feminist is the biggest disgrace to the star wars franchise as a whole. It honestly felt like a parody of star wars with a forced diversity agenda. There was a strong level of feminism throughout blatantly labeling men as stupid and reckless imbeciles. I feel like Rian Johnson has never even watched a star wars movie before because nothing about his film has a resemblance. There wasn't even a lightsaber duel in a 3 hour star wars film....... are you freaking dumb rian? My only last wish is that Disney drops the star wars rights because they have ruined it for mostly everyone. Congrats., 0.5,  Anthony M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/962448934/

 An excellent Stars wars story. Fun to watch. Excellent new characters. Goes a bit long and the spaceship rules were a bit strange. Still fun., 4.0,  Korey K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977056072/
 I enjoyed it. I like that there is humour in the movie, and the drama, tension and emotions were portrayed well. Whilst some parts were predictable, overall I felt the movie fit in well with the rest, and is definitely worth seeing, 4.0,  Josh B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/812681042/
 A fresh take on the series that admittedly had a few missteps. Though not enough missteps to garner the hatred it's gotten from a lot of people, in my opinion. This movie makes me exited for the third and final film in the trilogy, which is exactly what one should want from this second installment., 4.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977055313/

 The numerous failings and flaws of this film have been pointed out so many times in the other audience reviews here, but I feel compelled to speak on a few issues nonetheless: <br><br>A). About "fanboys": Don't dismiss them. Star Wars created fanboys and fanboys are largely responsible for creating the Star Wars blockbuster phenomenon that has lasted for over 40 years. I was 10 years old when Star Wars (A New Hope) first hit theaters, and up to now its goodwill has carried me through, many times groaning (especially with the prequels), but never perturbed as I am now. As I suspect it may be for many, the Last Jedi is the last straw. <br><br>Maybe it is a conscious act by Rian Johnson to kill the past. He certainly seems to be enamored with his own genius in "giving us the Star Wars we needed" as opposed to what we wanted. It seems, however, that he was so busy trying to subvert expectations that he failed to produce a coherent script. Ultimately, Johnson opted to throw the baby out with the bathwater, summarily dismissing 40 years of Star Wars legacy and lore to prove his own brilliance in giving us something unexpected and new. Well, my expectation that the movie would at least honor the Star Wars legacy was certainly subverted, and it appears that many, many people feel the same way. Johnson, Kathleen Kennedy and the TPTB at Disney should not be surprised if by "killing the past" they also end up killing the goodwill the brand has carried for decades. <br><br>B) WTF plot points that haven't been discussed enough:<br>The story is essentially two battles book-ending Rey's long weekend with grumpy grandpa Luke, with everybody else literally trying to keep busy until that is out of the way. And the best Johnson could come up with is a slow chase in space? I, as many other people have, wonder whether he ever saw a Star Wars movie before. Its not just the fanboys and geeks in this camp either, as his script defies basic logic on its own. Set aside that this chase takes place in an established universe where hyperspace travel exists and ships have different speed and weapons capabilities - the absurdity of it all is still highlighted by inconsistent developments in the plot. To wit: <br><br>So Admiral Holdo's big, top secret plan is to limp along until they can all sneak out on transports, go to Crait and use the base to call their friends for help. And in the middle of this, Poe calls Maz Kanata, a known friend of the Resistance, without anyone on his own ship let alone the First Order being the wiser... <br><br>OK, maybe Maz was too busy with her union troubles to forward a message, but did Leia or Holdo not at least contemplate trying to get on the horn with someone they knew? Instead, they sit on their hands while Finn and Rose go on their excellent adventure for 18 hours, using a transport to hyper jump away - again without anyone on their own ship or the FO even noticing... <br><br>Hey, maybe Leia or Holdo or someone else with some juice could have gone to Canto Bight or somewhere to use a pay phone there. Or better yet, they could have tried to get as many VIPs out on all those other transports, that are capable of hyper space travel and no one seems to notice...<br><br>Except for DJ. Who somehow knows Holdo's plan, even though the only people from the Resistance he has met are Rose and Finn, who wouldn't have been there in the first place if they were in any way privy to said plan... <br><br>PURE, LOGIC DEFYING GARBAGE. <br><br>Follow DJ's advice - don't join in this nonsense., 0.5,  Net P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977055096/
 The Last Jedi has killed the whole Star Wars series for me from here on out. The plot is full of holes, lame attempts at humor, and is yet another one time great thing ruined by political correctness/SJW nonsense messaging. Really sad flick, and a waste of my money and time. A bad end (for me) to a series that began as a really uplifting and fun series of stories., 0.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977055256/

 Top 10 Things We Know After Watching Star Wars: The Last Jedi...<br><br>1. Released Dec 2017. Any critic giving a positive review because a film is 'visually stunning' should be ASHAMED. This isn't 1993's Jurassic Park. This is 2017/18. We can make CGI stormtroopers on our phones!<br>2. Disney decided to use multiple directors for a Star Wars trilogy (seemingly without the two communicating), because continuity in storyline, character development, and overall theme is just boring...<br>3. There is now gravity in space! Resistance fighters have to DROP bombs directly over the First Order ships, and ships slow down when they run out of fuel. Obviously, long ago in a galaxy far away the vacuum of space had gravity.<br>4. Slap stick comedy is now rampant in the Star Wars Universe. Return of the Jedi can now be digitally remastered again!! The force ghosts appearing at the celebration after the Battle of Endor can be played by Larry, Curly, and Mo!<br>5. John Williams still has it! One star for John Williams.<br>6. People can survive the vacuum of space! When opening the bomb bays of the WWII style bomber ships, and when sucked out of an exploded bridge of a resistance ship in the worst Peter Panning moment in cinematic history people survive in space. I mean, space has gravity so it might as well have atmosphere as well..<br>7. "This is Hollywood. No one cares if a move is good as long as it makes money!" --Mark Hamill <br>8. This film did have editors' names listed in the credits. No one is really sure what they actually did, though...<br>9. Star Wars has produced the largest fan base of any movie series--one that has spanned 40 years, three generations, and made billions in merchandise sales. Disney and this director who shall not be named decided to 'kill the past' and 'go in a different direction', because, wait......Why did they do that?<br>10. The audience has spoken. Ep. 8 is the worst Star Wars move ever! As annoying as Jar Jar Binks was, Ep. 1 brought us a terrific Jedi scene. The Last Jedi has no redeeming qualities., 1.0,  James B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977055199/
 Probably the worst of the entire Star Wars series... (Un)funny jokes, bad script, weak characters, and simply insultingly stupid, 1.5,  Kobak K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977055207/
 Terrible story, mediocre acting. Major plot holes within the movie itself and also regarding following up previous movie. Certain plot twists were just cheap gimmicks, and had no place or effect on overall story., 1.0,  Peter H, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977055211/
 Confused and Disappointed<br><br>I went to see this movie to the first screening. Waited 2 hours to get the tickets so I would say that Im a fan. After episode 7 I was excited that this might turn out something good. I enjoyed TFA but its far from the best Star Wars movie. I had my hopes up to this one but it destroys everything 7 builds up and these movies ruins everything OT and prequels have done to this franchise. They should have kept George's story and someone else directing the movies. These new movies are missing the "Star Wars feeling" George's Star Wars had. There were good scenes but most of them was ruined with some stupid humour. This made my rating to from 3/5 to 1,5/5. In overall if you are an Star wars fan you will see all the bad and the couple of good things in this movie. If you are an average movie goer, not a fan who has seen the movies 391491 times you will enjoy the movie., 1.5,  Sami K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977055176/
 To quote my son: "I really liked the reclining chairs and the button to move the seat."<br>This film should be hauled away as garbage as a disjointed uninteresting mess.<br>When I saw the original, I was given hope fun and a sense of adventure. NONE of those things exist here. If you are inclined to like the few lines of dialogue that are not somberly slow, then yes, it has a few lines of that - but this basically loses any fun from the original and now takes itself very seriously. I guess that's our age of deconstruction and a dark storyline.<br>From the first scene it proves it is a boring slow paced uninspiring dark sad mess with colloquial phrases (of course attack of the clones calling someone "Dad" started this trend), and reveals what a cash grab this film series has become. Disney has perfected the Pavlovian response and from the years of going to see films just to finish off a series and we all line up. I am done with this crap.<br>The film starts with starts with a childish insult fest between Poe and the Orders general. Really are they that childishly stupid? I guess so. Why not just send them an insulting twitter message?<br>The bomber crews slow strafe to the battleships and the fact that over 100 people disregarded direct orders to retreat show a lack of discipline and faith in their leaders. Leia has lost it, and it shows. <br>With the grabbing of a medallion which seems mystical but is not -- we are supposed to care that the moronic bombardier/gunner is dying and later her sister shows it as a connection. Just the fact that the character could not re-climb a ladder and is kicking the ladder to get a control is not heroic, but idiotic.<br>The next scene of Finn in a plastic bag leaking and NO ONE whom is running past gives a damn.<br>What the hell was that? Funny? No.<br>The fact that the rebellion even exists only shows how their entire cause is lost - the Republic fell in about 2 weeks - must be some crappy administration.<br>And their plan with 400 people is to run - yet as they get picked off, why didn't the order launch EVERY fighter form the half dozen destroyers chasing them?<br>Then when did Leia escape Krypton to learn to fly in space? Stupid.<br>Why can't we tell the head of the entire fighter wing what the plan is? Because. . .I don't know.<br>Don't tell the new Admiral of an idea to stop the tracking - that would make sense!<br>Luke as a bitter old man drinking a creature's milk is weird. Why leave a way to be found if you don't want to be?<br>I agree with him, throw the lightsaber, feh. He's done some am I.<br>Kylo Ren says it best, let it all die - Disney you are doing a great job of that.<br>How is it that Rey knows everything? In the original trilogy it takes 3 movies and time to learn Jedi things - here, 10 minutes. <br>Porgs, which are not named, why are they there? I don't know.<br>I could feel the coldness of the production form that Irish isle myself in the slow pacing.<br>The laziness is also apparent - there is the fight scene in Jedi and the assault on Hoth. And that throne room - if it was any more poorly designed you could have shown the backlot - a red screen. I don't get these story choice in the least - it is so recycled it hurts.<br>The casino scene was entirely unnecessary. In fact, think a moment - if they could escape with miniships in multiple directions at light speed, why didn't they? And again pandering to babies and children the end scene of a kid using a force power to grab a broom looking up to the stars. That's not hope or marketing - it's whining.<br>And as for the rebels - run out of gas and get picked up one by one.<br>The fact that no one answers the rebels distress call only show everyone has moved on -- so should we all., 0.5,  Matthew R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/832591234/
 I loved that this Star Wars film had actual meat on its bones, it really explored and commented on the nature of good and evil, not like it's previous films which assumed the nature of good and evil. I thought the acting was great, the script was fun and illuminating, the action up to par. Not sure what folks are upset about, The Last Jedi is a fine film, as good as the last., 4.5,  William D, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977055183/
 Wow... I just... don't really have the words for ths. I was not a fan of The Force Awakens, so I waited a while to see this one, but I wasn't expecting something THIS BAD. WTF was Disney thinking with this? The Last Jedi is a total dumpster fire of a mess - filled with over the top humor and lame gags, preachy political and social commentary, and completely lame characters in asisnine situations. I'll say the visuals were impressive and the music was fine (even though it seemed like John Williams just rehashed his entire line up from Empire Strikes Back). <br><br>All in all: This was NOT the Star Wars I was looking for. Disney should be ashamed of making such a ridiculous mockery of Star Wars. Wake up Disney! You gave me some hope after Rogue One, but this... ??? Sheesh!, 0.5,  James W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977055014/
 Cheesey lightsaber duels, poor special effects, weak story, this film was a failure in so many ways! Luke's story is awful. Projection duel? What a weenie way to kill off the franchise's most iconic character? Rey is all of a sudden afraid of Kylo Ren? She beat the snot out of him in the previous flick! Story wandered aimlessly into plots that went nowhere and/or were just dull. I.e. Luke training Rey, The pointless trip looking for the codebreaker, Kylo trying to nuke Luke. This is by far the worst film in the whole franchise!, 1.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977055140/
 The Last Jedi is the most complex story we have seen to date in the Star Wars saga. It breaks the white hat/black hat/light side/dark side formula that we've come to expect. This is not another movie from my or your childhood. That, perhaps, is the problem for a vocal minority of fans who don't like TLJ. Without risking spoilers, characters in TLJ do not act as we expect Star Wars heroes and villains to act. Instead of god-like and faultless heroes, we get failure and disappointment. The villains falter. Just keep in mind that one of if not the most important themes in Star Wars is redemption after the fall. This movie is filled with a lot of the latter and a bit of the former. Failure: dwell upon that notion and think about all of the Jedi masters we have encountered. Remember also that this is the middle of this trilogy's arc and that the heroes we see are not written as gilded statues but as real people with real flaws., 5.0,  Dave H, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/852923668/
 Doesn't deserve to have the Star Wars title., 0.5,  Chris B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/956802747/
 It's the worst Star Wars movie to date; with a couple of memorable moments and too much progressive agenda. Sexual diversity, feminism, minorities, are things that are appreciated when they are natural in history, not when they put on shoehorns. Writers do not understand the universe of star wars, jedi and / or the force. If it were a movie outside of that universe it could have 3 stars; but in the universe of star wars it's a crap., 2.0,  Abysmal letdown.<br>Basically felt most of the movie, like the director and writers were trolling the audience and braking lore and old characters core on purpose..<br>would not see again, will not recommend to anyone.. lost all interest in the franchise, will not go and see episode 9, even for free., ,  juuso s, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976951357/

 So deeply disappointed right now. I dearly wanted to love this movie. I remember emerging from the theatre stunned, saddened. The reasons are well documented by many here.

 So everything that was built up in the previous movie is just ignored. The character of Luke is a completely different person than what we have seen. The main character is not believable at all in terms of what she can do. Hint to movie creators: Flawless characters are boring. The theme of the film seemed to be "women are smart, men are dumb"., 2.0,  Brian V, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977054855/

 I have to be honest and say the people on RT writing a review saying " wow best movie ever! " or similar, and giving 4 or 5 stars.... why dont you take the time to write what you think is so good about this trash movie? the bulk of people that do not like it are doing that. When all you can do is say " great movie loved it! " you look like a troll. List the points of the movie you liked. The rest of us, the majority did not like it and can list point by point why.<br><br>Some glaring things I found insulted my inteligence or tossed out old star wars lore.<br><br>1) C3P0... from TFA to TLJ the timeline is only a few days, maybe a week from the destruction of the first oder star killer. The resistance / rebelion is under sige... but in all this chaos... someone decided to find C3P0 a new matching arm ? ( arm was red in TFA This was more important than...I dont know....suriving the battles with the first order ? " Oh my god were going to die ! But...wait ! C3P0 !....I know your left arm is ok, and it functions... but I cant stand the color....go down to maintence and get a new one to match your other arm! " Is this what has happened amidst all the chaos ??<br><br>2) As has been noted, the humor was stupid, Hux and Poe the telephone call was idiotic, and after that you could not take any of the first order officers as serious characters.<br><br>3) The timeline for TLJ is only a few days from when the resistance destroyed the first order starKiller base from TFA..... in that time the resistance has become a shadow of its former self, no support, no money, no people, no ships....nada. They have been fighting for 40 years, saved the galaxy from Darth Vader, the Emperor, they destroyed 2 death stars and the first order planet killer ....and have no support from the galaxy of people they have been saving " oh yeah, thanks for keeping my planet from being blown up... money ? ...support?? ... yeah...well you know times are tough..sorry cant help you... " At the end of the movie...the resistance now..less 400 people, no ships, no nada...and to hide behind a big metal door the great plan was to send out a message begging for help....seriously ? If no one wanted to help the resistance at its best, no one would be coming when they are at their worst. <br><br>Just 100% shit writing, lazy writing.<br><br>4) Rose and Fin. Underdevoped characters brought in ..it seems for comic relief. Casino planet was a complete waste of time.<br><br>5) The force now....teaches you everthing you need to know. Training ??! Who the fuck needs training ?! Not Rey she know everything, including how to best a jedi master ! And not the kid at the end of the movie moving his broom in ways that took Aniken years to master ! <br><br>6) Luke...the man that can find good in Darth Vader, spare his life... now at a moment of weakness....is going to kill his nephew, his sisters and best friends son...because he has dark thoughts...? Did the idiot writer not read a book, or see any of the previous movies ? What ? This is good writing ? this is good character developement ? This is ...new ? it is beyond stupid.<br><br>7) Leia....never using the force for anything, cant use the force to find Luke....but in one moment when she is sucked into the vacume of space, can become the most powerful jedi or sith that has ever lived before or since? Wow... more shit writing, just for have a extra movie subplot? Or what?<br><br>8) Snoke.... dont know where he came from, how he took over power, who trained him...nada. There is no mention of his name in any of the previous movies, books, cartoons nothing. A character with no backstory, killed off. <br><br>9) Yoda, now is almost a god. He can command lighting to destroy things. Where the fuck was he, if he was so powerful to give Luke some tutoring when he was teaching his students?' Where was Obi Wan ? They let him fuck up with his students, and basicaly from that mistake the first order rises up.... and ..they leave him a lone in his depression on the island... But ! yod decides to come out of ...hiding ? And tell Luke the old jedi books are no longer important, and uses the force to burn the old books ? Seriously ? <br><br>10) The Knights of Ren are....where ? Anyone know ? <br><br>11) Kylo Ren and Fin, at the end of TFA are both very injured, now, a few days later in TLJ... they are ok ? <br><br>12) sub plots with no point, misplaced humor, no character development or very poor use of characters. Captain Phasma..what a waste.<br><br>13) Social messages...... we need this in a star wars movie ? Men are evil, or stupid or both. Rich people are all bad and cant be trusted...? This last part I find almost funny, coming from people like Kathleen Kennedy and the Disney executives...these people make more in 1 week than most people will see in 5 lifetimes... but, obviosly they do not consider themselves as rich / wealthy.<br><br>I can go one and on, and on, as to why this movie is so terrible, just as so many other people have. it is a shit movie, on its own it is a shit movie, as a star wars movie it is a disgrace. <br><br>If you are making comments...and if somehow you feel this movie is good, and seriously worth more than 1 star ....for fuck sake tell all of us that cant stant this movie, why you liked it. <br><br>Dont be a troll to try to push up the rating on RT, it makes you look like a complete fool. if you have time to make a positive review, then you have time to write point by point and explain why<br><br>I give 1/2 a star for good visuals and music, the rest of the movie is trash., 0.5,  Albert B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977043214/
 The summary? Meh. It is an utterly beautiful film with incredible production values, and sound and visual moments that will truly make you lost for words. They use music and sound (and most importantly silence) to set the scene well. For the most part the characters are good, although they really needed to narrow down the number of simultaneous plot lines in order to make us properly buy in to the characters.<br>But. And it is a big but! The story is honestly terrible. I don't mean from the Star Wars fanboy 'oh Luke wouldn't have done this or that', but in a more general sense. The timelines make no sense whatsoever, and the number of plotlines prevent us properly investing in any of them. <br>All in all, it is a passable sci-fi film, but a disappointing Star Wars one., 2.5,  Sam C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977054809/

 Taken in isolation as a standalone film this is poorly written and edited. I was bored at the incredulous and lazy script within 10 minutes. I rate it at 2 out of 5 on that basis. However if you are a StarWars fan and/or want to experience this as part of a bigger story it is even worse. Great actors. Dazzling effects. Beautiful soundtrack. Unique and invaluable legacy of the earlier films (including Episode 7 which was pretty good). All trashed by disastrous script, storytelling and editing. I cannot understand how this is even possible. Has Disney just bought the single film franchise with the most potential and trashed it? No coming back from this one I'm afraid Disney....This film has turned most fans and film lovers off StarWars for good. Well done., 2.0,  J M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977054791/

 A lot of the value of a movie franchise is in its continuity. Regretfully the Last Jedi has fails to maintain continuity with the Star Wars Universe, with in the trilogy to which it belongs, but most importantly within the movie itself. The premises for the story and the plot devices are simply not believable and poorly thought out. There are entire sequences which could easily be edited out with no loss to the story. The characters are not very engaging and it is hard to see how they are going to evolve. The protagonist herself has no more growing or development to do. The villains have no real presence. Admittedly the movie is in a fantasy setting, but some realism and consistency in the physics of the movie does help in the immersion of the audience. Perhaps the director should have consulted with his local high school physics teacher early on in the production., 0.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977054738/

 Being an avid Star Wars fan from the beginning, I knew 5 minutes in I was not going to like this one. I tried really hard to look for something redeeming, but thelonger it went on the more annoyed I became. I can picture arguments in the back room between Disney and the Director/Writers with Disney winning of course. I'm having a hard time thinking of this crap as "Star Wars" as it doesn't feel the same and the story line and characters are just not that interetsing., 2.0,  jen k, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977055033/
 The Last Jedi...otherwise known as "it just doesn't matter".<br><br> I'm a huge Star Wars fanboy and I walked out of Last Jedi and the best thing I could say about it was "Well, it wasn't horrible"...and I felt like "Well everything about the movie was trying hard, but why wasn't LJ good?"... it took a few hours but it all distills down to this..." Nothing matters anymore" Last Jedi makes all the events of all the previous Star Wars movies not matter and says to the fans " everything you want to know about the new characters just doesn't matter "<br><br>...Were you intrigued about Snoke? "Well it just won't matter"<br>...Want to know who Rey's parents are? "Well, it just won't matter"<br>...Want more Phasma? "Well, it just won't matter" <br><br>Some other observations and questions...<br><br>...Why introduce Holdo to throw her away? Why not give her entire arc to Admiral Ackbar! It would of given a classic character more screen time and send him off in noble fashion! to obvious maybe? God forbid.<br>...Luke Skywalker threw in the towel and would rather let the whole galaxy fall to darkness? Really? REALLY? way to plant a turd right on top of the original trilogy.<br>...Why not use the canon method of "anti-lightspeed" by giving Snokes ship "intredictor" tech?. Too old school?<br>...Poe is a traitor that can't follow orders and literally gets off the hook by being cute...really? He should of sat in the brig the whole movie or even better-dead.<br>..The alliance bombers? why not just use B-wings? oh wait, gotta have new lego sets.<br>..And Star Wars has a serious vehicle "size creep" issue...Smaller and faster is good too...<br><br>The questions and issues just go on and on with this movie...<br><br>Imagine if you will Ruby Rhod reading off a list of everything you want to know about Star Wars and then lighting that list on fire with an over the top "But who cares!"<br><br>The whole "chase the command ship" felt like Battlestar Galactica, the Finn/Casino story line was in fact a complete and total waste of time as it went nowhere without a single plot ramification...except to preach at you and del Toro? over-hyped would be doing the term a disservice. Also what in the world was up with some of the dialog ..."Godspeed"? really? The scenes that worked or were nicely shot could not carry the weight of what fell flat and the last scene...oh man is that a Disney commercial... When all is said and done though it is still better than the all the prequels combined but that is not a high bar to jump..

 Yick, what an atrocious movie. I too created an account just so I can give a voice to what was wrong with this movie. This was a pretty movie that had Star Wars music, but it was not a Star Wars movie. The rules in that galaxy that we've come to expect no longer apply. There is corny humor throughout and characters acting contrary to their personalities. But, the most offensive part was the social commentary. I could have done without the preaching and heavy-handed poltical issues.<br><br>Since this movie was an obvious attempt at feminism propaganda, I'll discuss it by gender...spoilers follow.<br><br>Men <br>Luke - slightly deranged, cranky and weak<br>Poe - impulsive, brash hothead<br>Snoke - weak and stupid<br>Finn - empty and cowardly<br>Kylo Ren - petulant, moody and destructive<br>Hux - a joke<br><br>Women<br>Leia - fearless, wise, can fly<br>Holdo - smarter than all the men<br>Rey - most powerful Jedi ever<br>Rose - worst character/actor ever portrayed in any movie, ever<br><br>Droids and Chewbacca - a mere prop who shared a combined total of about 5 minutes of screen time.<br><br>None of the intriguing questions that the Force Awakens were addressed in any satisfactory way. Rules of space and gravity don't apply. Jedi lore and legacy trashed. Scenes that should've ended up on the cutting floor occupy a bulk of time. Time wasted on pointless, tedious scenes that go nowhere. Characters that annoy and spout SJW nonsense (ROSE = JAR JAR BINKS level annoying).<br><br>Really, just a terrible installment of what should have been an amazing story., 1.0,  Sloane G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977055001/

 Star Wars episode 8-The last Jedi- Directed by Rian Johnson, expected by many and high expectations, does not disappoint, the film lasts more than two hours but it keeps you stuck to the seat from start to finish.<br>In the visual, the special effects as always well achieved, combining with photography, the artistic edition, and the music of the master John Williams, who leave it bright.<br>This new episode reminds us of Master Yoda's teaching times, making it clear that strength, within the galaxy, is everywhere and that independently of the Jedi, it exists in all of nature, and in any person.<br>And that's how Rey, the daughter of some junkyards, has the power of force at the same level as Kylo Ren himself, descendant of the Skywalkers, at the same time giving rise to the possibility of more history within the Star Wars universe and not only focused on the Skywalker lineage.<br>The film has more humor and new characters that do not clash as Jar Jar binks did in his time, Luke also in this installment appears with more humor than usual, even though in past films did not see that of him, not out of tune.<br>As for the story and the script can be said to be interesting, there are surprising and unexpected moments, if you could say that some loose ends were left that could have joined in this episode to give more depth to the story, although we do not know if it was simply left for the next and last episode of the trilogy., 4.0,  Pororo%20 D, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977054975/
 What was done in this movie to destroy the Sate Wars Universe could not be matched by any of the other movies combined.

 I'm not sure what to think about The Last Jedi. I saw it twice within the two days of opening and I left both viewings feeling excited and somewhat confused. After the first viewing, I loved some portions of the movie, for instance, the throne room fight scene, the light-speed destruction of Snoke's ship, Yoda's scene with Luke, and Luke's face-off with Ben Solo. All of those scenes were incredibly well shot and choreographed, and delivered on the action you expect from Star Wars. But I left with a feeling of confusion that undermined the scenes I thought made the movie very good. The Canto Bight scene for one was just poorly executed along with the whole side plot of Finn and Rose. I was not a fan. The second viewing however, I enjoyed a lot more because I focused more on the scenes I loved and less on the ones that caused my confusion. It was a much more enjoyable experience. I saw it one more time but didn't really change my perspective. I've had a longer period of time to marinate on the movie and come to my final verdict. I ultimately have decided I like the movie, but it could have been so much more. The transition from JJ Abrams to Rian Johnson did not go smoothly and that's what caused the flaws in this movie. Johnson didn't like certain things that were created by Abrams in TFA(The Force Awakens) and thus attempted to fix these "mistakes" and failed in doing so. Snoke's death, for one, is an example of this. It is clear that Johnson didn't like Snoke because he killed him off relatively early into the film and wasted his potential. The whole romance of Rose and Finn lacked character and was Johnson's way to get rid of the Rey and Finn relationship. That last kiss felt empty and had no real meaning. However I will say that the relationship between Ben and Rey that has been created as a result of this movie is something to look forward to in Episode 9 and how that plays out. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley's scene in the throne room is arguably one of the best scenes in the whole movie and saga, although I wish Snoke's death and the scene were later in the movie. But, the biggest grip I have in this movie is the underuse of Mark Hamill. Luke Skywalker, the man we have all been waiting for, is misused in a lot of ways. His first scene where he nonchalantly throws his lightsaber off a cliff encapsulated perfectly how you feel about the character. In your hands and then thrown away. Oh well, at least JJ Abrams is directing the last one so maybe he can salvage the pieces to this story., 3.0,  Andrew R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977040484/

 I grew up watching Star Wars, my brother and I would watch the original trilogy almost every week when we were kids. I had all the toys, I made all the Star Wars legos. The Star Wars movies became something that felt near and dear to me and kind of felt like it was part of my family. When these new movies and the sequel trilogy started coming out I felt like I became even more of a die-hard fan, like I was a kid again playing with my brother and going to see this awesome story of the ultimate good vs the ultimate evil. And I loved the feeling that The Force Awakens and these new movies were bringing back to the franchise; I was overwhelmed after seeing The Force Awakens for the first time, like it was the movie I had been waiting for so long to finally see. Then I went into The Last Jedi also expecting to see this Star Wars movie that I felt like I had been waiting almost my entire life to finally see. And yet, as much as I want to love this movie, I just can't. I understand all of the criticisms that The Last Jedi has gotten, and the feeling that it wasn't really much of a Star Wars movie and that everything built up before it was thrown out: The mystery of Snoke basically getting thrown away, Luke's backstory and disposition in the movie, Kylo Ren's backstory as it related to Luke and Snoke, Leia's near death/force powers, some of the seemingly pointless plot lines, all of the forced/slapstick comedy. I can really get over all of those, and in a lot of ways I actually agree with a lot of those decisions and how they did a lot of those things in the movie. It was awesome to have something different and new, and add a lot of things that had never been done before in the series. I can understand all of the criticisms to the movie, and yet I can get on board with all of those story lines and the direction of every piece of the movie. Except one. I cannot get on board with Rey just "being a nobody", no matter how much I think about it. I 100% completely agree with the argument that anybody should be able to be a hero or be able to use the force, and that anybody can basically become a Jedi/be powerful with the force, and that it shouldn't be exclusive to just a certain few who come from a particular family. Hell in the prequels there were hundreds of other Jedi's and padawans who were obviously all force users. But yet having said that, I don't understand why they couldn't accomplish both. Why couldn't they show that anybody can be force sensitive and/or become a Jedi while also having Rey have a deep personal/family connection to the Skywalkers/Ben Solo? At its core Star Wars is supposed to be about the Skywalker saga, that's the main point of the entire episodic series. And having Rey, the main protagonist be a nobody, in a lot of ways ruins all of that. What made the other Star Wars movies great were the interpersonal conflicts between the main characters as being the main conflict in the story. Luke vs Darth Vader, his father. Obi Wan vs Anakin, his apprentice/best friend/partner. By having Rey be a nobody, kind of makes this sequel trilogy pointless in a lot of ways. Yes obviously Kylo Ren is a Skywalker/Solo, but he's not one of the 2-3 main protagonists that you as the audience are emotionally invested in or are supposed to share an emotional interest in. In the prequels that was Obi Wan, Anakin and Padme. In the original trilogy that was Luke, Lei, and Han. In this trilogy its Rey, Fin and Poe. By having Rey be a nobody, it's hard to really care about what happens to her or the people she cares about. Rey could die or go to the dark side or destroy the resistance in Episode 9, and yet nobody would really care, because she's a nobody in the story. The notion that for this movie the hardest thing Rey could hear would be that she was a nobody, feels extremely weak and short. That notion holds very little to Luke finding out Vader is actually his father, or Obi Wan finding out that Anakin had turned to the dark side and betrayed the Jedi order. This movie and sequel trilogy as a whole would be a lot more powerful and have a lot more meaning if Rey had a deeper interpersonal conflict with Ben, if say she found out they were actually brother and sister. These movies would be a lot more meaningful if Kylo Ren and Rey were pitted against each other, yet both were deeply conflicted because they couldn't kill their own sibling, the way Luke couldn't kill Vader, or Obi Wan couldn't kill Anakin. I'm trying to resign myself to the idea that I need to wait to see how everything comes full circle in Episode 9, to see if a lot of the holes and mysteries that have been put forth in this trilogy can be fulfilled in a more meaningful way, and that in my hopes they add much deeper significance to this piece of the story and to Rey's parentage/back story, meaning, and interpersonal conflict, and that is the only reason why I am even giving this movie a 2/5. I hate to say, but in a lot of ways this could honestly ruin much of the essence of Star Wars for me. If Rey was to somehow actually be a Skywalker and for that to come full circle in Episode 9, I would probably give this movie a 5/5 in a heartbeat. But if Rey is still just a nobody after Episode 9 and the "Skywalker saga" is to be finished and thrown away the way it is right now, then to me this movie and trilogy would end up being a 0/5, and most of my interest in the future of Star Wars would probably and unfortunately be gone., 2.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977055574/
 Although fundamentally a well-constructed film, and at times enjoyable, Rian Johnson in the TLJ has sought to deconstruct the underlying hero's journey, which is the underlying theme to the Star Wars mythology that George Lucas created approximately 40 years ago. Luke Skywalker, which for many fans was the quintessential hero has been repositioned as a lost soul who wallows in his victimhood and appears as a tragic hermit. In addition, the force and the concept of the Jedi, which over the last 40 years has gained an almost religious adoration amongst fans has also been deconstructed. Consequently, the dark and light sides of the force have been treated with an almost relativistic indifference and the films overt intersectional politics overwhelm character and plot development. <br>In this regard TLJ is essentially a postmodern reworking of Lucas' various underlying universal themes such as the hero's path, and the eternal conflict between the dark and light sides of the force. We are told by Disney executives that this reworking is in order to take the brand in "bold new directions". Hence in a scene, which almost breaks the fourth wall, Kylo Ren the new emo villain of the series outlines the new path of the franchise by stating, "Let the past die. Kill it if you have to...". Hence, one cannot help but come away with the impression that the film has been produced by disgruntled nihilists that believe that their vision will usurp George Lucas' vision. In this I believe they are mistaken. <br>The concept of a hero's journey is a universal one that transcends culture, religion and gender. It is a concept that George Lucas well understood having been heavily influenced by the work of Joseph Campbell and the concept of the metamyth. Unfortunately for Disney, the hero's journey is not compatible with postmodernism's inherent nihilism and victim reverence. Luke's fall has broken one of the central tenants of the hero's journey 'The Return' in which the hero returns having retained the wisdom gained on the quest and thus ultimately achieves bliss. It is therefore little wonder that Mark Hamill and many superfans were deeply hurt by the unwinding of Luke's hero journey. According to Johnson, Luke was a victim and not the hero many visualised. <br>I believe that the franchise has been irretrievably damaged by the insertion of this path into the SW mythos much in the same way that the New Coke/Classic Coke fiasco did to Coca Cola in the 80s. Although many preferred the taste of New Coke the decision was a disaster. Much like Coke Disney has misunderstood the power of the core tenant upon which a brand stands. Unlike Coca Cola fiasco, however, the damage will be a near impossible task to minimise less undo. I therefore cannot award this film anything but a half star as I believe in time this film will be seen as a franchise killer., 0.5,  Matthew M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977055414/

 Yes, I am a new user who created this account to rate this mockery of a Star Wars movie. No, I am not a troll, a hater , a white supremacist, or part of the "conspiracy group" to bring down Disney. And yes, I think the "critics" and the raving idiots giving this movie 5 stars are simple-minded, half-wits. First let me start off with the fact that I am more of "The Hobbit" and "Lord of the rings " girl, however I love Star Wars, and especially the The Clone Wars and Revenge of the Sith. I was not born when the original triology was released, but I found it to be mesmerizing. I don't really understand why the prequels are so despised by some fans since they told the story of how everything started, including the journey of Anakin Skywalker from a Jedi to a Sith. I loved Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kanobi and Hayden Christensen as Darth Vader. They both had depth and convincibility that the new characters lack in many respects. I even enjoyed Darth Sidius (the Lord Sith) manipulative and conniving ways, he knew just what to say and when to say it in order to bring the worst in Anakin.<br>The Force Awakens was passable, however I hated that they so quickly got rid off Han Solo, but I was excited at the promise of Luke Skywalker in the upcoming movie. What a mistake on my part...Instead of getting the Grand Master Jedi, who could have replaced Yoda as the leading Jedi, I lived to see this marvelous character milk a walrus, drink green milk , and catch the fakest looking fish possible. Then we have to listen to the stalest, most forced , copy cat dialogue between Rey and Luke. With Rey trying to talk Luke into training her so she can convert Rylo( another idea borrowed from previous Star Wars films). Then we witness Rey's 5 minute lesson on how to become a Jedi when she slices a rock and watches it roll down the cliff breaking the card of the poor frog looking caretakers of the Jedi Temple( one of the few comedic moments I found funny). Rey becomes so powerful that she even defeats her teacher Luke - totally unbelievable. Then we get the utterly boring and completely illogical space ship chase, the made-to look ridiculous general of the First Order and the absolutely annoying, condescending, arrogant and unlikable Admiral Hux, the purple haired lady. The only satisfying thing about her character was when se decided to stay in the mother ship and kill herself in order for the other pitiful bunch of losers to escape (one would think that such an advance ship would have autopilot and would not need anyone staying behind, but as I said I was overjoyed to see her go). If only Admiral Hux has told Poe and Finn about her plan, there would be no need for the Casino scenes, but the "heroic lady "did not want to appear as a martyr or a hero so she kept it all to herself. <br>And then we get those stupid looking birds-Porges. They were everywhere , in all the scenes, even in Chewbaka's spaceship...how did they get there..noone knows. <br>The Rose character with her ridiculous haircut, self righteous attitude and constant preaching made me want to puke...especially the forced kiss with Finn and the" we protect what we love" speech. And let me tell you that I do not believe it for a second that Finnor any other man unless blind and deaf would find this utterly unattractive, void of personality abomination of a woman- yes I said it..<br>Now we come to the supposedly ultimate villain Kylo Ren ( since the real Sith and villain Snoke was killed as easy as you chop a mouse). Kylo Ren's angry outbursts made him look like un emotionally unstable, almost hormonal mockery of a villain. We are now to believe that this semi-Sith without real knowledge of the Dark side, without any composure or will strength is supposed to be the number one Sith in the galaxy- weak, very weak and implausible. However, when one comes to think about it this parody of a villain might actually succeed because what is left of the resistance are a bunch of losers without manpower or weapons worthy to fight with.<br>And lets not forget the puppet looking Yoda who shows just in time to burn the Jedi Temple, after which bursts into crazy laughter and mocks Luke Skywalker for caring about the Jedi scripts. <br>Luke Skywalker trying to kill his nephew in his sleep without even talking to him first is totally unbelievable and illogical to his character, I would say killing someone in his sleep is low even for a Sith.<br>The "bold moves" and "twists" are nothing new but exact copies of previous SW films down to the scene when Kylo tells Rey that they should both rule the galaxy and create new order; a scene taken from Revenge of the Sith when Anakin tells Patme exactly the same thing before his fight with Obi Wan. <br>The end scenes with Leia were cheese and overly optimistic regarding the condition the resistance was in. Even though we know that at the end they will win, the characters themselves donot know it and should show more humility and contained hope rather than the sure belief in their success. That is what separates the SW from the likes of flicks like The guradians of the Galaxy. Believability, depth and substance over cheap tricks and overly arrogant good guys sure of their success which makes the villains look pitiful and kills the suspense.<br><br>The movie is a total mess, devout of any feeling or depth, the magic is gone buried in forced dialogue, illogical sequence of events and totally forced diversity , the only ethnic group the "creator" RIan Johnson forgot to include is the pygmy man...what a miss Rian, how could you forget the pygmy man?<br>Luke SKywalker needs to come back redeemed. George Lucas must to return.

 The Last Jedi was terrible. Not just because it was a bad "Star Wars" movie. It was just a bad movie period. I will not pay to see another Star Wars movie after this.<br><br>Spoilers. Ranked 8 of 9 Star Wars movies in my rankings. Hell people on Rotten Tomatoes gave Justice League a higher rating.<br><br>It wasn't just bad, it was stupid . Here are a lot of the problems (Many borrowed from Ben Shapiro)<br><br>1. The Force Awakens Apparently Never Happened. At the end of the last movie, you'll recall, the Rebel Alliance blew up the Starkiller Base,<br>devastating the First Order's capacity to make war. Or not.<br><br>2. There Is No Gravity In Space. The opening sequence features bombers dropping explosives on a First Order dreadnought.<br><br>3. Snoke Is A Throwaway. In the last film, JJ Abrams made a big deal out of this Snoke guy. Now, I'm not a fellow who spends a lot of time googling<br>whether Snoke is actually Darth Plagueis or whether he's Mace Windu. But if you're going to build up a big baddie who has the power to seduce<br>Kylo Ren to the Dark Side, completely override Rey's force abilities, and threaten Luke, you've got to tell us who the heck he is.<br><br>4. Kylo Ren Isn't Intimidating.<br><br>5. Rey's Backstory Sucks.<br><br>6. Luke's Weird Farmer Life Is Weird. Did we really need a whole day of Luke going around milking an alien seacow and drinking it?<br><br>7. Luke Is A Bad Teacher. Luke says that he's going to provide Rey three lessons. The lessons consist of him (1) telling her what the Force is (okay,<br>we already knew that); (2) having her touch a rock and see the Dark Side (she's drawn in by it but not seduced). There is no third lesson<br><br>8. Celebrity Cameos Make No Sense. Laura Dern with purple hair? Benicio Del Toro stuttering? What are these people doing here?<br><br>9. Poe Dameron's Story Arc Is Foolish. Poe is supposed to be newfangled Han Solo. Fail. First off, there is no new Han Solo. Second, Poe is a<br>dolt. And Admiral Laura Dern, working with Leia, has a plan they could easily just tell Poe and solve half the conflict of the plot. Why keep it secret<br>from Poe? We never find out. Instead, Poe runs around like a moron, making stupid plans with Finn that have no actual effect on the plotline.<br><br>10. Finn's Storyline Is Useless. Finn should have died at the end of TFA. He should have died at the end of The Last Jedi. Instead, he goes on a<br>random jaunt to Monte Carlo with aliens, and then rides a bunch of camel/horse/kangeroos to freedom while street urchins cheer. It's godawful. Then,<br>finally, when he's about to do something useful, Rose stops him from doing it. Why is he here again, except to have awkward hugs with Rey?<br><br>11. Rose Is Useless. Rose is added to the plot to give Finn someone to travel with and develop awkward romance with. But her presence is simply<br>not useful. She doesn't do anything particularly special. She does give Finn a lecture about income inequality, though. So I guess that's something.<br><br>12. The "slow speed" (in Star Trek terms sub-light) chase? seriously. "Fuel" has never been mentioned in 9 Star Wars movies (or the extended<br>universe or even the RPG). If Finn and Rose can jump away and back again the first order could have entered hyper space and jumped in front of<br>the rebel ships. Hell apparently they could have went to another star system (and maybe gambled and drank for awhile) and come back in front of<br>them or right next to them like Finn and stupid Rose.<br><br>13. Captain Phasma Is A Nothing. She's apparently a white woman who wears a cool suit, and then Finn - a dude who five seconds ago was a<br>janitor - beats her. Welp.<br><br>14. Luke Shouldn't Have Been A Hologram. Turning Luke into Obi-Wan Kenobe for purposes of the reset makes some sense. But his death made<br>none. Why is it cool for Luke to survive a barrage from AT-ATs if he's not even there? Why is it cool for Luke to best Kylo Ren in a light saber battle if<br>(1) Rey has already done so, and (2) Luke isn't even there? They easily could have brought Luke there, and had him do exactly the same thing, but<br>sacrifice himself - or perhaps just fade away in front of Kylo Ren.<br><br>15. The Powers Of The Force Aren't Magic. We learn that through the Force, you can now hologram yourself places, and that you can also survive<br>being thrown into space (Leia). Wut?<br><br>16. Light Speed Can't Be Used As A Weapon. You can't destroy ships by flying at them at light speed. If you could, the entire first scene would have<br>been unnecessary (forget the bombers, just shoot an X-wing through that dreadnought), and the Rebel Alliance could have taken down every Death<br>Star ever in the same way.<br><br>17. Why Would Luke Try To Kill Kylo? He tried to save Vader after Vader destroyed a planet and cut off his hand. He sensed good in him. He<br>senses evil in Kylo and for a moment wants to kill him? That seems like a mild stretch at best.<br><br>18. There Are No Interesting Characters Left Except For Kylo Ren. So, now everybody's dead. Han's dead. Luke is dead. Leia was never that<br>interesting, but Carrie Fisher died, so Leia can't stick around for long. That means we're left with the new characters - which is the point, since Star<br>Wars can't survive on nostalgia forever. But Rey isn't particularly interesting - they just gave her a crappy backstory., ni,  J S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976993886/

 Remake it, or strike it out from canon completely! I can't stand bad writing( i.e. Rey as a Mery Sue) as well as I can't stand blatant, blunt SJW/feminist propaganda and the fact, that for producers that political message was more important, than telling a good story. Only what they care about is money, but not quality. Propaganda and resenitment over Trump election is more important for them, over universal message and respect of legacy. Message of TLJ, and TFA as well, by the way, was political, wrong, and makes those movies very soon outdated, propably. What they wanted is an empowering feminist fantasy, but since they lack of creativity, they hijacked broadly beloved franchise, destroying it as "outdated relict of patriarchal dominance" and, on its ruins/corpse/remains, build their propaganda piece!

It breaks the white hat/black hat/light side/dark side formula that we've come to expect. This is not another movie from my or your childhood. That, perhaps, is the problem for a vocal minority of fans who don't like TLJ. Without risking spoilers, characters in TLJ do not act as we expect Star Wars heroes and villains to act. Instead of god-like and faultless heroes, we get failure and disappointment. The villains falter. Just keep in mind that one of if not the most important themes in Star Wars is redemption after the fall. This movie is filled with a lot of the latter and a bit of the former. Failure: dwell upon that notion and think about all of the Jedi masters we have encountered. Remember also that this is the middle of this trilogy's arc and that the heroes we see are not written as gilded statues but as real people with real flaws." End quote<br><br>????? WTF !! You do not make any sense, sorry. God like faultless heros? Um...did you note see the movie with Rey in it ? She is more a god now than...god. She has no faults, and knows everything. jedi in the past needed training..rey. hell no, training is for nerds or other people. failure?' I assume you aretalking about Luke. Luke failed a lot, in training and similar in the past, Go back and see some of the other movies or red some of the books.

The rest of us, the majority did not like it and can list point by point why.<br><br>Some glaring things I found insulted my inteligence or tossed out old star wars lore.<br><br>1) C3P0... from TFA to TLJ the timeline is only a few days, maybe a week from the destruction of the first oder star killer. The resistance / rebelion is under sige... but in all this chaos... someone decided to find C3P0 a new matching arm ? ( arm was red in TFA ) This was more important than...I dont know....suriving the battles with the first order ? " Oh my god were going to die ! But...wait ! C3P0 !....I know your left arm is ok, and it functions... but I cant stand the color....go down to maintence and get a new one to match your other arm! " Is this what has happened amidst all the chaos ??<br><br>2) As has been noted, the humor was stupid, Hux and Poe the telephone call was idiotic, and after that you could not take any of the first order officers as serious characters.<br><br>3) The timeline for TLJ is only a few days from when the resistance destroyed the first order starKiller base from TFA..... in that time the resistance has become a shadow of its former self, no support, no money, no people, no ships....nada. They have been fighting for 40 years, saved the galaxy from Darth Vader, the Emperor, they destroyed 2 death stars and the first order planet killer ....and have no support from the galaxy of people they have been saving " oh yeah, thanks for keeping my planet from being blown up... money ? ...support?? ... yeah...well you know times are tough..sorry cant help you... " At the end of the movie...the resistance now..less 400 people, no ships, no nada...and to hide behind a big metal door the great plan was to send out a message begging for help....seriously ? If no one wanted to help the resistance at its best, no one would be coming when they are at their worst.<br><br>Just 100% shit writing, lazy writing.<br><br>4) Rose and Fin. Underdevoped characters brought in ..it seems for comic relief. Casino planet was a complete waste of time.<br><br>5) The force now....teaches you everthing you need to know. Training ??! Who the fuck needs training ?! Not Rey she know everything, including how to best a jedi master ! And not the kid at the end of the movie moving his broom in ways that took Aniken years to master !<br><br>6) Luke...the man that can find good in Darth Vader, spare his life... now at a moment of weakness....is going to kill his nephew, his sisters and best friends son...because he has dark thoughts...? Did the idiot writer not read a book, or see any of the previous movies ? What ? This is good writing ? this is good character developement ? This is ...new ? it is beyond stupid.<br><br>7) Leia....never using the force for anything, cant use the force to find Luke....but in one moment when she is sucked into the vacume of space, can become the most powerful jedi or sith that has ever lived before or since? Wow... more shit writing, just for have a extra movie subplot? Or what?<br><br>8) Snoke.... dont know where he came from, how he took over power, who trained him...nada. There is no mention of his name in any of the previous movies, books, cartoons nothing. A character with no backstory, killed off.<br><br>9) Yoda, now is almost a god. He can command lighting to destroy things. Where the fuck was he, if he was so powerful to give Luke some tutoring when he was teaching his students?' Where was Obi Wan ? They let him fuck up with his students, and basicaly from that mistake the first order rises up.... and ..they leave him a lone in his depression on the island... But ! Yoda decides to come out of ...hiding ? And tell Luke the old jedi books are no longer important, and uses the force to burn the old books ? Seriously ?<br><br>10) The Knights of Ren are....where ? Anyone know ?<br><br>11) Kylo Ren and Fin, at the end of TFA are both very injured, now, a few days later in TLJ... they are ok ?<br><br>12) sub plots with no point, misplaced humor, no character development or very poor use of characters. Captain Phasma..what a waste.<br><br>13) Social messages...... we need this in a star wars movie ? Men are evil, or stupid or both. Rich people are all bad and cant be trusted...? This last part I find almost funny, coming from people like Kathleen Kennedy and the Disney executives...these people make more in 1 week than most people will see in 5 lifetimes... but, obviosly they do not consider themselves as rich / wealthy.<br><br>I can go one and on, and on, as to why this movie is so terrible, just as so many other people have. it is a shit movie, on its own it is a shit movie, as a star wars movie it is a disgrace.<br><br>If you are making comments...and if somehow you feel this movie is good, and seriously worth more than 1 star ....for fuck sake tell all of us that cant stant this movie, why you liked it.<br><br>Dont be a troll to try to push up the rating on RT, it makes you look like a complete fool. if you have time to make a positive review, then you have time to write point by point and explain why<br><br>I give 1/2 a star for good visuals and music, the rest of the movie is trash."<br><br>End Quote., 0.5,  Carter R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977031684/

 This is a smug, charmless mess of a movie that sets new lows for screenwriting arrogance and incompetence. TLJ is paradoxically too clever for its own good and also profoundly stupid. A few visual masterstrokes can't redeem glaring plot holes or shallow, underdeveloped characters. <br><br>The ruination of once-beloved icon Luke Skywalker is unforgivable, especially in the service of a lazy low-stakes story. If a franchise feels compelled to destroy a cherished character it should at least be for a believable reason, not because the writer's a creatively-bankrupt nihilist. <br><br>Throughout this insipid slog writer/director Rian Johnson exhibits sneering contempt for the audience, the franchise, and every single one of his [vastly superior] creative predecessors.

 I hated Luke in this! This old selfish, Kermit, bum, coward loser tried to kill his cousin in his sleep &amp; doesn't even show up in his face, He's Not Even There In The Physical Form! And Luke commits suicide by Astral Projection, well that's a bad way to go out! 2 Lightsaber battles vs Kylo Ren &amp; none of them lasted 40 seconds. Christopher Reeve in Superman IV went out better than Mark Hamill did in this movie, that's sad. What did Luke do? Assassination attempt, Trains Rey &amp; Commits Suicide. This is the movie he died in? Wow. Nothing Memorable. I still enjoyed the film &amp; thought it was fun, Kylo &amp; Rey vs the guards was choreographed well &amp; was the best scene in the movie. Luke in this film should've been a carbon copy of Obi-Wan in Episode IV. The only way to make up for this is some type of "Days Of Future Past" time travel in the next film &amp; ERASE what happened in The Last Jedi. Give Mark Hamill a 5 minute Lightsaber battle vs Kylo Ren or a New Villain, have an old Chancellor get Assassinated in the beginning of Episode IX by a New villain &amp; at the end of the film, you find out this Rebel was the new villain, Now that sounds Compelling!, 2.0,  Brock G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976861496/

 Like so many, I prepared for this film properly - early bird ticket, no spoilers, no reviews and zero expectations - only to flee the theatre afterward in a fitful state of bewilderment and dismay.<br><br>This film was so terrible, it drove me to an immediate second viewing in disbelief, then tears and finally Rotten Tomatoes to comment.<br><br>A must watch if you appreciate endless plot holes, ill timed slapstick humor, tonally disjointed scenes, Jedi skype calls, laughable villains, pointless side quests, uninspiring new characters, force ghost lightning (wtf), low gas tanks, absent autopilot and droids, light speed crashes, lazy subversion in place of quality consistent story telling ...and pairing the truly abysmal assassination of Jake Skywalker (see Hamill's interview) against the all powerful, yet unrelatable Mary Sue (see internet)... and of course, porgs. <br><br>Keck. <br><br>I would like to include a special thank you to both directors - and perhaps Disney - for allowing our once beloved hero, NOW warped cynical deranged defeatist coward, to greet Rey in TFA in FULL "Sunday Best" JEDI ROBES - before pitching his Father's light saber over a cliff in pure slapstick fashion, choke on milk from a quadriplegic sea sloth and repeatedly retreat to his hut in fear in TLJ.

 This movie is a special case. After lots of thinking, I've decided that this is my least favorite Star Wars movie. Overall, it was boring. There was almost nothing memorable, and what was good didn't last. The movie was bogged down with politically correct bullshit that was boring and stupid. I absolutely hate the Rose and Finn arc, the Poe and Leia stuff was ehhh, but the Luke, Rey, and Kylo stuff I actually liked. They put aside characters I actually like in order to give the new characters, that I absolutely hate (Rose and Holdo) some shit to do. Overall, it was forgettable and just hit or miss., 2.5,  Ryan T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977036381/

 I had been a lifelong fan of star wars until I saw this movie.The plot holes in The Last Jedi ruin not only this movie but ruin the entire franchise for me. In particular, what was done to Luke Sykwalkers character in this film did not make any sense, nor did it do any justice to a true hero., 0.5,  Greg%20 L, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977054241/
 Excellent cinematography and good special effects can't hide that this is a really crappy movie. The plot makes no sense, the characters appear all to be irrational and their actions are usually stupid. The portrayal of every male character is insulting, with nearly all of the men portrayed as hotheaded fools who can't control themselves. The portrayal of Luke Skywalker is insanely out of character and an insult to long time fans of Star Wars movies, games, and TV shows. The attempt to defame everything and dismiss everything from the previous films prior to Disney's buyout of Lucasfilms is even more insulting. The ridiculous ignorance of Star Wars setting basics, consistency, and compatibility even with the immediately previous film in this so-called "trilogy" is an insult to the audience's intelligence worse than any Star Wars I've seen since the Star Wars Holiday Special (oh the horror of that one). Rian Johnson appears to have gone out of his way, and quite overboard in insulting the fans. I will never see another Disney Lucasfilms version of Star Wars again. Nor will I buy their junky unwanted merchandise that's related to this film. It's such a horrible movie, I wish that it were possible to erase my memory of The Last Jedi's existence. This is an awful film. It's trash. Garbage., ,  Alan C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977055871/

 Disney Destoyed Star Wars! Very bad movie and storyline!, 1.0,  Brian N, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/918552166/
 The worst Star Wars movie ever. So many plot holes. Nothing was built off the previous film. It's almost like the force awakens never happened. I thought the second movie was supposed to build off the first? How could Disney executives allow this film to be made?, 0.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977054786/
 A lot of the value of a movie franchise is in its continuity. Regretfully the Last Jedi has fails to maintain continuity with the Star Wars Universe, with in the trilogy to which it belongs, but most importantly within the movie itself. The premises for the story and the plot devices are simply not believable and poorly thought out. There are entire sequences which could easily be edited out with no loss to the story. The characters are not very engaging and it is hard to see how they are going to evolve. The protagonist herself has no more growing or development to do. The villains have no real presence. Admittedly the movie is in a fantasy setting, but some realism and consistency in the physics of the movie does help in the immersion of the audience. Perhaps the director should have consulted with his local high school physics teacher early on in the production., 0.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977054738/

 I left the cinema with mixed feelings after being extremely excited for the movie. The more I think about the movie the more dissapointed I find my self. I am sure I will just parrot many others but I there were just so many things wrong for me. Seems like the new director just shat on everything JJ set up in episode VII, starting with Luke throwing his sword away and that trend continues through out the whole movie. I won't even get into all the blatant agendas that were shoved down pur throats in a fantasy movie ... that being said, I am still cheering for SW and I hope the next one will be better., 2.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977054723/
 Good things:<br>1. Visuals. <br>2. Actors play. Good performances especially of Adam Driver, Mark Hamilton, Daisy is not so bad at all but she could ride her convoluted always-look of confusion - it is not even matching her character of being independent. Suprisingly, even the characters were pissing me off, the actors did the best. This is what everyone can agree to be honest.<br><br>Bad things.<br>1. Plotholes.<br>2. Unnecessary b-plots (like Canto Bright)<br>3. There is no logic in this movie. Bombs pulled off vertically because there is gravity in space, Leia blowed up to the space and then flying back to the ship with force.<br>4. Twist-over-twist. I think the critics like the film because it subverts all your expectation. Who is Snoke? Meh, nobody. He got killed by a brat who is supposed to be the next intimidating villain. Haha, I do not get it and I am not excited. Who are Knights of Ren? Meh, who cares. So you have to say, its subverting ALL expectation a good thing itself? Well, if you cannot write a story that is consistent, definitely not. It is easy to subvert expectations just by not telling anything.<br>5. Deconstruction and destruction of Luke Skywalkers character. The symbol of good, honesty and HOPE (Episode IV's name "The New Hope" was not in vain!) turns out to be grumpy, whiny douchebag. He tried - against all the hope and all people - turn his father to good knowing he is a mass murder. But just sensing that could be darkness in his nephew - son of his sister and best friend with whom he gone to the war - he said - e, f*ck it, lets kill him. <br>6. Ideology. There is so obvious propaganda in this film and it is served with every second line. Anticapitalism, pacifism, animal rights, children rights, forced diversity among the cast, feminism: all important position on Rebels side are held by women, wiceadmiral Holdo bashing Poe Dameron for having overtestosteron dose, all white men are a) fascist yelling at everyone around, b) life failures (starting with Han Solo who made divorce with his wife and left his child). When you have put ideology like that - at least be subtle and do it with consistency and artistry. <br>7. There is no difference at all - there is no originality. Just because The Last Jedi does not tell anything about main points made in TFA and subvert this way all expectation of the fans - but is not originall at all. Crate is nothing like Hoth (I suspect that in original cut of the movie this was the beginning of the film), Dreadnought is nothing like Superdestroyer, Luke is living like a hermit just as Yoda did, Rey is new Luke, Imperium chase the ship(s) of Rebels, we have speeders fighting on Hoth, pardon, Crate. The same old, but with new merchandising creatures and just edited in slight different order. <br>8. Sense of humor and merchandising creatures - Disney at its best. I must say, nothing like plotholes, lack of logic, lack of motivations was telling me to leave the cinema before end like this retarded attempts to be funny. Yo mama jokes in Star Wars? Luke and cow with blue alcoholic milk? No.<br>9. One of the main arch in movie is the chase of imperial ships trying to get the rebels ship. This was so slow and lacking of any logic I could spent five hours to telling how stupid it was. Why the imperium ship did not just make jump into hyperspace once and then jump again to get closer to the rebels? Why not call for help the other parts of the fleet? <br>10. Rose character. When you saw the film you know why. It is not of surprise than the Chinese people turn against the film. If Rose character was to catch the chinese audience it was doing in the most insulting way possible, because Rose is dump retarded idiot that was used to express ideology and not to make any sens at all. And Chinese are people with commons sense and they did not buy it and this is why in the second week the revenue of TLJ was dropped in China by 94%. <br>You could say the same for the Afroamericans, the film tries to be diverse, but honestly, Finn was no less idiot than Rose. He had a chance for being hero, but the Rose destroyed it by... flying into his ships and make dumbest comment ever. When Finn was a white male from my country, I would be feel offened by the way Disney has seen me. Nice job, Disney Diversity - in the end, you even screw your own assumptions., 0.5,  Kamil K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977054714/
 "Critics Consensus: Star Wars: The Last Jedi honors the saga's rich legacy while adding some surprising twists -- and delivering all the emotion-rich action fans could hope for."<br><br>^^^ That is an outright lie. The Last Jedi did not honor Star Wars legacy at all. The biggest thing I could see was a giant middle finger to The Force Awakens. It mockingly destroys every plot point brought up before this movie.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, the movie wasn't horrible it's just that it wasn't good either. The visuals were stunningly beautiful and the sound was excellent. The plot, or lack of, is the biggest problem. The writing was also lazy and horrible.<br><br>Was there a feminist agenda? Some people claim yes. If there was, they did a really bad job of it. All the women in TLJ were horribly written and very shallow. <br><br>Luke Skywalker - Badass Jedi? Nope, grumpy old man that doesn't believe in good any more. I get that Disney wants to move forward and leave the original characters behind. That's fine. But if Luke is going to die, why couldn't he really fight Kylo Ren and be defeated by the Dark Side? THAT, would have been good controversy. <br><br>Rey - Badass woman, because you know, magic. She had known about the Force for all of 3 days and can beat a guy that has trained for YEARS with the most badass Jedi of all time, and also trained at least a little by Snoke. She is a nobody from nowhere? Fine, nothing wrong with that. But knowing things by magic is just poor and lazy writing.<br><br>Poe Dameron - Best pilot in the galaxy? But he's bad and stupid because he is a man. Retarded logic. At least he was actively trying to save the Rebellion/Resistance.<br><br>Finn - Also bad and stupid because he is a man. This leads to the pointless subplot, why? The only thing it accomplishes is more woe for the Rebels. Lazy writing.<br><br>Kylo Ren - Probably the only good character in the entire movie. He is emotional and unstable, that's great. I actually like that. It flows with the plot that he was turned or seduced by the Dark Side.<br><br>Leia - wow, what a shake my head character in this movie. She can survive the vacuum of space and Mary Poppins back to the ship because... she is a woman and needs no explanation. It's almost a disgrace to the memory of Carrie Fisher. I mean she passed while this movie was being made. That would have been an excellent time to write her out of the story with dignity.<br><br>Admiral Purple Hair - Commander of the Rebels... because she is a woman. Good leaders do just that, lead. Subordinates trust them and follow orders. She had a disregard for Poe because he was a man. There was no need to let her people know the plan? That only created more havoc than good. <br><br>Captain Phasma - Good lord! Why hire an actress like Gwendolyn Christie and not use her? There was so much potential there! Again, I think this was a knee to the groin of The Force Awakens. She was on screen for less time than TFA!<br><br>Chewbacca - I'm surprised they didn't kill him too.<br><br>C3PO - What happened to the red arm?<br><br>R2D2 - one of the only truly great scenes in the movie, which was also just a rehash/replay of A New Hope.<br><br>Admiral Akbar - dies (?) off screen, nothing to see here...<br><br>Rose - almost a good character, but involved in the pointless subplot. She stops Finn from sacrificing himself for the greater good because "to win save the ones you love, not kill the things you hate." Great message, but you just killed all of your Rebel buddies because the cannon now fires on the base. And love? They knew each other for like what, 12 hours?<br><br>Terrible, terrible lazy writing. <br><br>The Good<br>* Visuals, sets, and sound<br>* Finding the map that leads to Luke<br>* The Force connection between Kylo and Rey<br>* Force projection<br><br>The Bad<br>* Pointless subplots<br>* Poor writing, script, dialog<br>* Casino planet<br><br>The Ugly<br>* Seacow Alien Milk<br>* Poorly timed jokes and one-liners<br>* Snoke - unimportant bad guy<br>* Luke's heart attack, 2.0,  Ian V, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/780959481/
 Hugely disappointed that this seems to have been a missed chance. TFA created so many great characters to be further developed and questions that were yelling to be answered and it is as if TLJ film creators looked at all the great fan theories and said wouldn't it be funny if we just said none of it really mattered! With gender, race, equality and corporation issues shown to us on a daily basis, it didn't need to be so overly brought over and emphasized in a galaxy far far away. The creators seem to have brought modern prominently young sociaties issues and layered them throughout this film that in the end it looks like Star Wars but no longer feels like the Star Wars. Kylo Ren says 'let the past die, kill it if you have too' which should have been the films tagline as well as a warning to all long-standing Star Wars fans to let go of all your nostalgia for the previous films or this movie will kill it for you., 1.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977054664/

 I loved the visuals! Everyone I know loved the visuals! Those bird things were adorable! I also loved...<br>No, I take that back. That's all. Apart from those things, I really hated everything else about it. The story has more plot holes than a flour sift. The characters are outright revolting. The effort being made to merchandise this filth is ridiculous! Fin is a coward, Rey is pathetic, and frankly those are the only descriptors I can give to almost any character I see in the story. Before the end, I wanted to shoot that weenie Luke myself, and watch that hacker fly away with the Falcon! It would have been better ending than the stupid slackers we saw flying away with it.<br><br>No, this stands as proof. Proof that the Authors and Directors of this film have no concept of integrity, virtue, or ethics. A monument of delusional ignorance in our generation.

 We all know The Force Awakens (Episode VII) is a rehash of the original (Episode IV). The best thing it has going for it is Rey, the first believable female Jedi to appear in the onscreen saga. So the only reason millions of fans flocked to the theater to see Episode VIII was to see Rey's story - to find out where she came from and how she received her powers. Essentially, J.J. Abrams pitched a softball to little Rian Johnson, the kid who eats paste and drools on himself, and somehow that kid dropped the ball. <br><br>Instead of receiving satisfactory answers to the questions that have haunted us these past two years, the audience received a diaper full of poo flung at its face. More disturbing, critics ate it up with a poo-eating grin and said, "Thank you, Disney, for making a strong feminist statement." And 49% of moviegoers wrote about how bold and unexpected it felt to have a diaper full of poo hurled at their faces. They denounced fans who questioned its integrity, asking, "What did you expect - the same old Star Wars movie you've seen before?" We can all agree on one thing - this is not the Star Wars movie we were looking for.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I appreciate The Last Jedi's originality. However, there exists a nearly infinite number of original plotlines not involving a diaper full of poo. Specifically, by "poo" I mean Poe, Poe prank calling General Huck Finn of the Costco Empire, Finn, Finn running around leaking bodily fluids around the spaceship, the spaceships chosen by the Costco Rebels that either used 1940's bombing technology in zero gravity or run out of fuel after one jump to hyperspace despite their enormous size relative to the smaller craft that can jump to hyperspace without a care and travel to pointless subplots such as the rescue of The Codebreaker from Rainbow Bright, everything to do with Rainbow Bright including the disappointment resulting from the misuse of Benicio Del Toro in a pointless role that exists only to set up another film that Disney expects us to pay to see rather than utilize him as either The Collector from the MCU and profit from a crossover or better yet have him play a more vital role in the establishment of the First Order whose origins remain unexplained and who have somehow managed to resurrect themselves in a matter of days following their defeat in the previous film, all of the questions from the previous film receiving a middle finger from the writer of this piece of trash who answers questions like a drunk dad trying to get his kids to go to sleep ("hey dad, how did Rey get her powers?" "who cares, her parents were deadbeats who sold her for drinking money!" "hey dad, why did Kylo Ren destroy the Jedi Academy?" "because Luke Skywalker is an a-hole who walks out on his family!"), the complete desecration of the beloved hero of the Star Wars hero Luke Skywalker by showing him not only drinking milk from the tits of a sea monster but willing to murder his nephew yet unwilling to face him as demonstrated by his massive effort exerted to create a holographic likeness of himself to pretend to face Kylo Ren across the galaxy, this effort resulting in Luke's unnecessary death which would have meant something if he had chosen to die fighting Kylo Ren face to face in the first place . . . basically the entire movie - you get the idea, right?<br><br>Dissecting this movie is exhausting, because it is a labyrinth of confusion. Why? Something to do with feminism and proving that anyone can be a Jedi. Accordingly, the film introduces a purple-haired feminist caricature, who we will call Admiral Gender Studies, to put Poe in his place. First of all, we have established that no one really cares about Poe. More importantly, the film had unique feminist icons in both Rey and Leia already, characters that we do care about. Rather than compose great stories about these beloved characters, the writer chose to drone on about some nonsense built to support his hollow agenda. I say this because his is a) a man and 2) a rich, white man hired by a massive multi-national corporation to create a blockbuster installment in the most profitable money-making franchise in movie history. How about making a movie about how anyone can become a screenwriter? There are hundreds of people with MFAs in screenwriting working as baristas who would give anything to have the chance to write a Star Wars script. Yet Disney gave the golden ticket to this unworthy fellow, this spoiled hack who can't write his way out of a paper sack, this fraud who has the audacity to tell kids that anyone can grow up to become a Jedi, standing on the shoulders of giants while he laughs all the way to the bank.<br><br>This film is not just a bad movie and not just an insult to millions of fans. It is an act of malice, much like Luke attempting to burn the Jedi scrolls. It is an affront to humanity, for if this is the most we can achieve with millions of dollars and the most creative minds hard at work, then we do not deserve to survive as a species. God might have mercy on The Phantom Menace because at least it respected the legacy, but The Last Jedi deserves to burn in Hell., 0.5,  Private U, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/799268131/
 The Last Jedi is the worst Star Wars movie yet and a terrible follow-up to The Force Awakens, which I thought to be overall a decent reboot to the series. Over half of the plot in The Last Jedi could have been completely removed from the movie and it would make no difference to the overarching storyline. There were unanswered questions from the last film that were answered in the most absurd and disappointing ways. There is also a plethora of plot holes, and the SJW agenda is blatantly obvious and unnecessary - I went to see a Star Wars film, not a propaganda film. The only redeeming factor in this whole movie is the visual effects, but that should be expected of any Star Wars film with a similar budget. Don't let Rian Johnson anywhere NEAR episode IX. I will not be rewatching this one., 0.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977054596/

 Episode 8 Character Assassination. The more I analyze this movie the more angry I become at it. Never have I experienced a property that so callously dismisses and insults its source material. Disregarding the idiotic plot holes, obvious sjw political agendas, the treatment of the character of Luke Skywalker is enough to warrant a bad review. One more thing, the character of Rey IS a Mary Sue. Compare her character arc to that of Luke's, by the second film she has defeated a trained Jedi in Kylo, mastered the Jedi mind trick, mastered the light saber bested Luke FRIGGIN Skywalker, all with NO TRAINING! By Empire Luke had been trained by two Jedi masters, had to be saved several times by Obi and Han, was nearly killed on Hoth and realized that Yoda was right, he wasn't ready. This point was demonstrated when he tried to face Vader and lost his hand after getting his ass whipped. Rey hasn't struggled or overcome anything. She is the definition of Mary Sue. If that offends you then you are likely a man-hating sjw snowflake, an idealogue like Johnson and Kennedy that just ruined this franchise., 0.5,  Robert%20 T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977054567/
 I got my rotten tomatoes account because of this film. While visually beautiful, musically pleasing, and great sound effects, that is about it. Character development was a waste, there are numerous plot holes, and Disney has tried very hard to push both forced humor and social agendas. Ive never rated a film before, but this was bad. Disney has its clutches around some of the best franchises in the history of entertainment, but if TLJ is any indication, we can expect those franchises to die mediocre, sloppy, joke ridden, merchandise driven, money grubbing, visually impressive deaths., 1.0,  Peter R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977053976/
 Seriously flawed movie., 1.5,  Adam H, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/799863205/
 Appalling! Rey's suddenly a nobody. Snoke is a nobody. Luke is a nobody. The story dumps on any good idea the rubbish, fan pandering Force Awakens had. The writer/director of The Last Jedi should never work on this again., 0.5,  Mark A, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977011461/
 I think all the hundreds of reasons why this movie was so mind bogglingly terrible have been explained in prior posts. I just wanted to more describe the experience of watching this monumental pile of wet bantha poodoo at my local theater. The audience was completely silent except for some nervous chuckles. I saw it late at night and there were a lot of millenials there who for the most part probably didn't understand the power and magic the OT had if you were a child growing up with it. I vividly remember seeing Ep. 4 at the age of ten and the crowd cheering and laughing loudly... it was an integral part of the experience, just goosebumps over and over. Fast forward to 2017 and I wanted to and should have walked out of this trash compacted garbage heap during the casino planet disaster... but have been waiting since 1983 to see my childhood hero Luke Skywalker come back and kick some butt. (SPOILER) Then he turned out to be a hologram... and then he just died for no explained reason. It tore the soul out of my body and urinated on it.<br><br>Also Luke never told Leia or the like 20 people left in the Resistance what his plan was - to stall the enemy. Really good thing they figured it out and left through a tunnel to be miraculously picked up by Rey in the Falcon. A side note Anyone wonder how the First Order didn't notice it sitting there plain as day on the surface of Crait? I mean it was only like what a mile or two away from the base. Wouldn't the skies be black with tie fighters??? Anyway as I left the cinema all the millenials filed out silently staring at their smart phones... it was probably the most depressing moment of my movie going life. Never going to give another dime to Disney for what they did to me. Unforgivable... the end., 0.5,  Brian J, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977053838/
 I'm a recent fan, like less than a year, and I'm not attached to the canon that took place before The Force Awakens. The character that intrigues me the most, and who is the reason my interest in Star Wars has not only continued but grown, is Kylo Ren. I wasn't sure what to think of him in TFA; I felt disgust and horror at his actions and immaturity, but also reluctant admiration for his strength and stamina. That's one powerful, messed up guy, and as a writer, I'm simply fascinated by his character development. I've seen TLJ four times in theatres--unprecedented for me--so that I can watch the interactions between him and Rey; I swear every time I notice more nuances in his expression and demeanor that have me rethinking his motivations. He seems to wear his emotions on his sleeve, yet I'm never convinced I know exactly what he's thinking. Rey, on the other hand, is as easy to read as a large-print book, but that suits the character. All of the performances were great, but in my opinion, Adam Driver is exceptionally talented.<br><br>What I could have done without in this movie is everything to do with the Finn and Rose storyline. I don't care that much about Finn as a character (I was okay with what he wanted to do at the end), and though I do like Rose, I was so engrossed in the rest of the story that I was impatient for their irrelevant scenes to end. I know which chapters on the bluray I'll be skipping--and I know which ones I'll play on repeat. <br><br>I liked Poe more this time around, liked BB-8 less, wanted to stand up and cheer for Holdo, wanted to smack Luke upside the head (with affection, like Gibbs), and I'm still torn as far as Leia's concerned. On one hand, I'm saddened and disappointed that she wasn't the mother Ben needed, and on the other, I sympathize with and have respect for the strong woman who survived so many trials and tribulations. I mean, no one can do it all, and it's interesting that she's a better general than mother (which is debatable, considering how much ground the Resistance has lost). Usually it's fathers who take that stance. I cannot imagine what they'll do with her character in IX without Carrie Fisher (R.I.P.).<br><br>I'm very excited for the next episode; I would much rather see IX this year than the Han Solo movie., 4.5,  Danielle S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977053657/
 Lol at all these people not getting their perfect Star Wars film. Complete idiots. This was a really good Star Wars flick that I thought ran a bit too long. I love the fact that the director poo-poo'd all over the JJ Abrams setups from TFA. Also, finally someone is acknowledging that the force is somewhere between good and evil. Good riddance to the Jedi, let the Force forge its own path!, 4.0,  Matt W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/971731164/
 Finally! A Star Wars made in the spirit of the original Star<br> Wars. I think and and all true Star Wars fans will enjoy this movie. Wish I can give it 10 STARS. Loved it!, 5.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977053831/
 Average at best. No real plot twists and plot all together was bad. Killing off Snoke right away??? Looked like they were going to expand on the force and didn't. What was that part when she was in the pit..no explanation. Also Kylo goes from not being sure if he's good or bad to being bad and killing all the other students? That made no sense. Everything was kind of rushed through. No good character development at all. Lukes acting was average. I didn't mind how he died at all and actually thought it was one of the few bright spots his final fight. Just nowhere near the force awakens. I guess because all the summer movies sucked Hollywood is grasping at straws. Effects were decent.. I love the guy who says if you don't like the movie we don't like diversity so now this is a diversity thing hahah oh man. Great way to rate a movie. Bottom line Johnson is not a good director at all. Bring back Force Awakens director!!, 2.0,  John R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/868140888/

 This movie will go down in cinematic history as the best/worst example of what not to do with a middle film in a trilogy of movies with established series/lore.<br><br>Despite the fact this movie is visually stunning and sounds amazing the story was depressingly dull with no world building, no arc, no tension giving us characters<br>unbelievably stupid (especially if they were male) <br>with cringe inducing comedy moments that systematically trashed any chance of drama. <br><br>The movie systematically either ruined or ignored all of the interesting questions and mysteries of the TFA and criminally shoe horned politics into the narrative at the expense of <br>story at every given opportunity.<br><br>Rian Johnson took a giant dump on this franchise and I am astonished Disney let this slide. Easily the worse Star ars movie ever put to screen. The huge fallout and reduced<br>sales should be enough to let Disney officials understand that ths movie was not good enough. Star Wars is not bullet proof. Not good enough., 0.5,  Simon H, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/937010014/
 This movie was an absolute flop for multiple reasons. (SPOILERS AHEAD)<br><br>To start, dry humor is continuously forced down your throat in the beginning of the movie, only to suddenly drop off without warning. It is awkward and poorly paced.<br><br>People outside of the Skywalker family having Force abilities IS NOT new. It has been established in canon multiple times. It is nit groundbreaking or revolutionary. It is just untasteful repitition in attempt to be quirky.<br><br>The destruction and regression of the charatcers is another huge thing. Remember, this movie takes place a day after TFA and is about a span of a week. Rey, who absolutely DESPISED Kylo to begin with, ships herself into the enemy's hands because she has apparently forgotten all of the stuff Kylo put her through. Leia barely bats an eye after losing her husband AND her brother literally days apart. Also she suddenly gives you on her son, literally after stating that she believes there is still good in him?<br><br>Luke. Possibly the worst. A man who saw the good in his father, who killed children and innocents atop many other things, when no one else would. Luke would never DARE think about killing a SLEEPING CHILD, who hadn't even turned to the dark yet, because he was "scared". <br><br>Finn barely developed and that is sad. Have you all forgotten that Finn came from nothing? And yet Rian reduces him to practically nothing.<br><br>General Hux did not fear Kylo or Snoke and was terrifying, yet he's reduced to a coward and a comedic relief.<br><br>Snoke and Phasma were unceremoniously killed off after greatly teasing their importance and the mystery surrounding them.<br><br>Also, the forced romance was NOT needed, it was actually repulsive. Kylo abused Rey and manipulated her, yet she feels compelled to help him and symphathize with him? Rose suddenly loves Finn after knowing him for two days? Yikes.<br><br>And ultimately, Star Wars has ALWAYS been about family. If you want something new, then the Skywalker epilogue isn't for you.<br><br>Let me make it clear that the reviews for this movie aren't bad because some "men despise the female lead". If it was truly about that, then TFA would have suffered the same way. This isn't just a bad Star Wars movie, it is just a bad movie in general. Rian Johnson has poor writing abilities. It was his job to tie TLJ to TFA, yet he chose to ignore almost everything and made something that lacks continuity.<br><br>I would suggest not wasting your money and time on this movie., 0.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977053733/
 The Last Jedi has some good moments but that makes the entire thing more disappointing. The direction taken with characters like Luke, Rey, Poe, Hux, and Finn are all disappointing.

 I loved the movie, great effects, no too many slow parts. However there were a couple head scratching moments. One would be how short Rey's training with Luke was. It was basically two scenes, while Luke's with yoda back in the original trilogy was much more in dept and longer. The other moment would be the whole Finn and Rose and the code breaker part which just never needed to happen. They basically put themselves in danger for no reason at all.

 Absolutely atrocious! Zero out of five stars is too easy of a decision. Not only a horrendous Star Wars movie, but also one of the worst movies I've ever had the misfortune of watching. It made the prequel trilogy look like masterful work. I don't see how this dumpster fire ever made it to the screen. A complete money grab with an elementary school level plot, if you can call it that. It's like Rian, JJ, Kathleen Kennedy, and Disney have never seen Star Wars or decided to murder franchise. And that they did. They've killed a beloved franchise., ,  Eric T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976973771/
 Possibly the best Star Wars film I've seen since the 80s. It's a tad too long but has a lot to explore and unpack in its run time.

 Omg.. that movie had three different endings.. it felt as though the writers took 5 different scripts and couldn't decide which was best so they took elements of a lot of different stories then tied them into one. There were several "jump the shark" scenes that felt unnecessary but probably were there just to keep the story together. SO disjointed.. I defy anyone to make sense of the major gaps and contradictions in the film. It gets you cheering for one set of characters then makes you doubt their purpose and in the end there really are no heroes.. was that supposed to be the point?? Ugh.., 0.5,  Noe G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/975883011/

 Utterly heart-breaking. While there were a number of good moments, the overwhelming feeling leaving the cinema was that this film was not merely a missed opportunity (Snoke, Akbar, Luke etc.) but a trashing of the franchise, killing off its best characters and setting up a real turd of a finale. As good an actor as driver is, he lacks the menace necessary for this franchise; Rei goes in to the final movie as woefully underdeveloped as before; and, well, who is left? This was not The Last Jedi but The Last Star Wars; I hope the director enjoys his 30 pieces of silver for this effort: he will certainly go down in film history. The series is now, in my view, unsalvageable. <br>As for the positive critical reception, please Google (or better, use DuckDuckGo) 'Gamer Gate' - its a total con job; these people were either paid off or are sucking up to someone big time. Totally dishonest. You've heard about the fake news; open your eyes to the fake media. Disgusted., 1.5,  Armchair C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977054472/
 Absolutely brilliant movie!! I loved every moment. The visuals are spectacular the story is great and yet again the cast does an amazing job. Rian Johnson did a great job in my opinion, John Williams Score was yet again beautiful and was put in the film perfectly, and action sequences was spectacular. I personally don't get the hate, I found the character of Rose was good, the comedy worked and Luke's story was very believable. I know a lot wanted nostalgia seeing Luke as the great hero again and I would have too but I get why they changed the way he is from what happened in those previous years. Overall "The Last Jedi" is pure escapism at its best.. Highly Recommend., 5.0,  Movie F, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/971699059/
 This so called Star Wars films does a disservice to the original characters, story and fans. It dishonors the saga and replaces it with a dumbed down, reduced galaxy and one dimensional characters.

 This is a Disney by-the-numbers type of film. Notice that all the hero's are minority or women actors and all the bad guys are white men or white women? There some subtle brainwashing going on right there.<br><br>Looks like Disney is in the process of making the most politically correct star wars from here on out so that means if you are a white male, you will automatically be cast as the bad guy because, you know, white males are bad.

 Good visual, sound and of course John Williams always make a great score. But the writing destroyed a lot a story tread that was set up in the previous film. Il also seem to want to destroyed the lore established by the 7 previous film. Some plot line seems totally pointless in the overall story of the film. The caracther has almost no real devellopement except for a contrive romantic story line that is cringe worthy. Star Wars has always had a politcal message in it's undertone but never a star wars movies has ever been so overtly politacal and make the watching experience very ackward at time. Overall it is not a good star wars and it feel more like a end than a middle of a trilogy., 1.0,  Renaldo N, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/811999189/
 When I originally saw this film I was releived that it was not copy paste episode 5, like 7 was of 4. However upon further reflection I have come to the conclusion that while containing interesting exploration of The Force as a... well force, the rest of the plot is so convoluted and horrendously bad that the recent film Jumanji had a better and more clear plot than anything this film has to offer. This is not only a disgrace to the legacy of Luke Skywalker. This is a slap in the face to the far more talented theory channels dedicated to bringing to life small explanations or fillings in that are more entertaining and captivating than cantobyte and the slow drawn out "chase" sequence that comprise this films runtime. This is the equivalent of if the opening of a new hope were made into its own film with unoriginal planets of "not Hoth" and "not Yavin 4", excepting cantobyte which is entirely filled with political commentary more fitting of a news station than an action adventure film. This is of course not mentioning the unbelievable and ludicrous "love" story between Finn and Rose. Why are they in love, they have been together at max twelve hours and most of that was spent having them at each others throats or sneaking around. But I digress. Having recently rewatched the entire series (minus TFA) I can definitively say that this movie is not deserving to be called finished as it was released, let alone a Star Wars movie., 0.5,  Matthew%20 F, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977054196/

 Left theatre so disappointed. I'm a casual franchise fan and enjoyed The Force Awakens. Like the new characters but this film did zero to advance the plot or make me care about what happens next.

 This movie opens up so many doors for the Star Wars universe. It added much needed depth to Kylo Ren, as well as giving much better insight into Rey. I appreciate the time spent getting to know both of these characters better. It dawdled in a few places, and had a tendency to use uninspired logic to move the plot forward. (Running out of fuel? Really?) The new characters that were introduced were fairly interesting, if not often unnecessary. The twist at the end was fantastic, and this movie included one of the most iconic Star Wars scenes ever. With a few tweeks in the script, this could've been a solid 4/4.5 star movie., 3.0,  A C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977054147/

 This is the first time I have revised a rating based on a multiple viewing. I watched The Last Jedi for the second time, mostly because Ladybird was sold out. While I enjoyed it the first time, the flaws screamed out on the rewatch. The plot is pretty minimal, Finn's side mission is pointless, and our hero Luke Skywalker is just depressing to see. And I'm sorry, seeing Rey as a super charged Mary Sue is agitating. You can't root for a protagonist who excels at almost every challenge and seems to have the wbility to best everyone at everything. It took Luke Skywalker almost three movies to become a strong Jedi, and Rey is all that right off the bat along with an ace pilot, mechanic, and basically anything else the plot calls for. At the end of the film I had one thought - how is one ship full of about 35-40 people supposed to present any real threat to the still powerful First Order? I guess it's Rey against the galaxy, and in this trilogy Rey will probqbly take everyone in a cakewalk., 1.5,  Bill S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976871547/

 I walked into the theatre expecting all of my questions from episode 7 to be answered, and left sorely disappointed. Plot holes were completely thrown out, and new ones were created. The writing was horrible, and Disney's humor just doesn't feel right inside of a Star Wars movie. This movie would be summed up as an hour and 30 minutes car chase through space, an unnecessary romance used for filler, and concluded by what was hands down the biggest letdown of the entire movie. Fans of the franchise will be disappointed, and folks new to the franchise will probably think it's fine. Either way, after watching it, it's pretty obvious how episode 9 will play out. I expected more from Disney., 2.0,  Austin F, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/890869414/
 The fail is strong with this one. Horrible writing and directing. Filled with wasted time, plot holes, tone mess, attempts at humor that ruin serious scenes, and shallow characters with no development clearly put in to fill a checklist for the social justice, diversity, and feminist agendas that were the overpowering themes in this movie.

 I'm a big fan of Star Wars, but not this one. Jokes, one liners, and unnecessary CGI mar what is a blah plot line that is filled with holes. It is obvious that large parts of the story were cut out, even though the movie runs long. Most of the film's subplots are inconsequential in the big picture and really only involve stalling, the all-powerful villain is mishandled, and big problems seem to have simple solutions that come off as cop-outs. In an effort to seem progressive and teach a lesson it fails to entertain as we expect from Star Wars movies. Laura Dern's Adm Holdo is only superseded by Jar Jar Binks as the character that was most infuriating/disappointing., 2.0,  David H, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/851337690/
 Way too many SJW references. Humor was out of place. Pacing of the film is terrible. Pointless characters and scenes. Underwhelming music score by Williams. This is a terrible Star wars film but an ok sci fi at best. The original trilogy really is in a galaxy far far away. This film has no respect for what makes a good star wars film and has instead butchered all the good things from force awakens and had left us.

 I really don't get all the hate for The Last Jedi. It's a rich story that honors the Star Wars legacy as it transitions to it's new heroes. It's as emotionally engaging as any previous offering. John Williams' score is amazing as always.<br>To the haters: get over yourselves., 5.0,  John L, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977053984/
 After hearing other people talk about the movie I figured I'd still probably at least enjoy the movie even if I wouldn't love it like the last one. However I am shocked at how disappointing this movie was! Snoke was nothing more than a plot device with zero payoff to who he is, Rey's parents end up being nothing, Luke's death at the end is totally "wat," and it basically made every male in the movie into either a blundering idiot or a villain while every female was righteous, smart and valorous... I'm all for equal male/female treatment but this was not equal at all. The story was filled with holes and totally broken. It had a few cool action sequences which were neat and some humor here and there but otherwise, a major disappointment. I would rate this one as being just as bad as Phantom Menace., 0.5,  Addison S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977053482/
 Absolutely NOT the disastrous mess people are making it out to be. While a little over-long (needs 15 mins trimmed off) it's still an unexpected and enjoyable film that even brought some emotions out of me from my Star Wars childhood., 3.0,  Tim S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/806959122/
 Everything that JJ created was S'd on in this film, 0.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977053433/
 As a fanatoc, i can say that the film is very disjointed. Finn and Rose basically run around the whole film doing nothing to advance the plot, though they do meet Del Toro's White Lando analogue. Rey and Luke's story is a total nightmare, where we are treated to a retconned version of the Force that violates decades of precedent across nine films and three cartoon television series, where the dark side, previously an aberration is now just a spook, because neither dark nor light exist or something. Luke also seems to be a completely different person than he was last we really met him in RotJ, in ways that remain perplexingly unresolved. When he says that it's hubris to think the light will go out with the Jedi Luke makes a grossly false point. You see, the Jedi are merely a group, yes, but they are clearly needed, and any group to rise up in their stead would have to have the same doctrine (since canonically the Qui-Gon had the true and correct interpretation of the Force) simply through existing through the Force, but it's important to not that it took the Jedi thousands of years to develop their ideas, so it would be selfish to try and kill the Jedi and set the light back in such a way. At some point Luke is confronted by Yoda's ghost, lamely as a puppet, who can apparently physically touch Luke and summon thunderbolt. Both things never demonstrated before! Yoda also goes on to call the most sacred texts of his order, which he'd no doubt memorized in his youth, BORING and says that Rey already had the teaching inside her, an impossibilty. It's freaking insulting. Rey goes into an "evil" cave, sees stupid visions which couldn't possibly mean anything. All this while waiting outside Luke's but a la Project Mayhem's membership drives from Fight Club. There are great moments, but they're kind of lost between all the jokes (one every 5 to 10 minutes) and all the story that doesn't go anywhere. Kylo's plot is sort of interesting, but when Snoke makes fun of Kylo's mask it totally took me out of the film, since as recent as 2016 Disney put out books saying that those masks carry a religious, cultic significance. His Pope just made fun of his cross, man! Kylo and Rey's subplot is stupid and violates so much about the Force... also, it's shot poorly. It uses dialogs to explain things to the viewer that they should have just showed us.<br>There's just so much dumb going on in this film... for instance, it seems to start weeks or months after TFA, and picks up with the Republic being disbanded and all remaining Resistence and Republic forces now number a mere 400. Which is a weird place to start. Last we saw the Resistance they were celebrating a major victory. <br><br>I actually kinda liked the astral projection bit, and Luke's final scene was well shot, but unemotional since he's such a jackass for no good reason the whole film. This is honestly in my opinion the worst Star Wars film as of yet.<br>I&gt;III&gt;V&gt;IV&gt;II&gt;VI&gt;Rogue One&gt;VII&gt;TCW&gt;VIII, 0.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977053380/

 I personally loved this movie. Yes there parts that I didn't agree with like the whiole Finn and Rose arch, Canto Bite, the comedy, Snoke, etc... But the thing that I had the problem with the most was how they handled Luke Skywalker in this movie. A Jedi wouldn't give up, he would never let the Dark Side of the Force get to him/her, infact Yoda once said Fear is the path to the Dark Side. Having grown up with the original trilogy, I just don't agree with the choices Arian Johnson made about Luke Skywalker. But if you put all that aside it is a really a great movie. I don't think the movie is perfect. Like many fans this isn't the Star Wars Film that I expected or wanted, but I still really like it! This is just my own opinion and you don't have to agree with me., wts,  Nolan B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977053382/

 Absolutely dreadful movie. Beautifully filmed with great fx - in fact possibly the best-looking Star Wars movie to date - but in every other way a pile of rubbish that desecrates the legacy and memory of a beloved franchise. I thought that the Force Awakens had already killed Star Wars and found it depressing; but this piece of incoherent tripe stomps on the grave and spits on the headstone - and it makes me angry., 1.0,  Peter George S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/908868574/
 The Last Jedi is amazing. The 1/2 star spamming on RTs is RIDICULOUS. Not liking the film is fair, but dont buy into the 1/2 star trolling.

 From someone who's seen all of them in the theater, this is easily the worst Star Wars movie yet. It's an agenda movie, written and directed with the sole purpose of literally changing everything and attacking every criticism of TFA and Star Wars in general in order to appeal to critics. TFA copied Ep4? This copies 5 and 6 together while changing eveything solely for that purpose even though it it breaks story logic and character motivation. It truly is a broken movie that achieves critical success by taking a red marker to the concepts that "modern audiences" find quaint about the originals, focusing bluntly on current affairs politics and presenting it under the star Wars banner; what Lucas originally created "a story of good versus evil for 12 year old boys" and Disney uses as a 2.5 hour toy commercial., 0.5,  Core I, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/967794357/

 Destroying the iconic character of Luke Skywalker!<br><br>I grew up with Luke Skywalker who saved his evil father out of compassion and fought for his friends. Only a shadow of this character is left in The Last Jedi. Instead we see a grumpy and angry old man who wants our new hero Rey to leave him alone. Fine so far, if this changes over the course of this movie, but nope, that is the Luke&amp;Rey dynamic in this whole movie. No emotional and personal bonding. We learn what happened between Luke and Ben (his nephew) and in this Luke entered with an ignited weapon the room of his nephew because he sensed some darkness and had for an blink of an eye the idea to kill him. Yes, just throw the whole original Lucas trilogy out of the window for this. I call this lazy writing to make Kylo look better and a character assassination.<br><br>So we can follow Rey, who should then be the eyes of the audience? Nope, she acts stupid and listens to evil Kylo, despite that this guy tortured her in the last movie and killed and injured her best friends. Rey also needs no training and like in the last movie, she just lest the force in and can do everything without training. Luke does not really train her and instead tells he why the Jedi should end and why he came to the island to die. Another big failure. Rey and Luke even fight and of course the Jedi master Luke is beaten by a not trained Rey...what a surprise.<br><br>We come to another big issue of this movie the slapstick Marvel humor entering Star Wars. Poe making a prank call to Hux, Hux ridiculed by Snoke in front of the other First Order soldiers. Then we saw some of Luke's daily life and I wish I could get the scene out of my head with Luke milking this big pace creature for green milk. We also got a scene in which Luke wants to burn the temple tree after Rey was gone, but cannot do it and then Yoda appears and shows him that he did not learn anything in 30 years, because Yoda is still the master and force lightning style burns the tree.<br><br>We also have some other characters in this movie like Finn and newbie Rose, but who cares, because the plot does not care and her casino planet mission was useless and failed in the end. It was only there to have them something to do. The plot of Poe and Holdo as both competitors for military leadership was again a sign of bad writing and Holdo simply telling Poe about the rescue plan would have saved us the usleless Finn&amp;Rose mission. <br><br>The last appearance of Luke, after no one else came for rescue was another rollercoaster of bad writing, bad execution and simply bad directing. It starts with a nice goodbye scene between Luke&amp;Leia and so we expect a showdown between Luke and Kylo. Yes, the First Order shoots everything at Luke, but we already wonder where did Luke get his hair cut and dyed + bis beard trimmed on the way to this final confrontation, but whatever. It looked exciting first, also when Kylo finally ignited his saber to battle Luke, but then we learn Luke is just a force projection. We see him meditating on his island while crating the projection....impressive, but wait...the next second he falls down on his meditating rock, crawls back and with pain in his face fades away. So Luke Skywalker dies and this was it what he achieved = nothing, only a handful of rebels escaped in one ship! Of course we saw wonder Rey at the end levitating rocks and helped them escaping, but is this enough together with broom force boy to bring me back into cinema for episode IX? Nope, that was it for me after over 30 years sadly!!!, 1.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977053264/

 I found this movie quite honestly, a 2 and a Half Hour nostalgia-filled childhood movie.

 Star Wars is dead. Disney holds the knife.<br><br>I'd give this movie a lower rating, if one existed.<br><br>I'm a Star Wars fan, and have been for years. This film was a deliberate kick in the face to people like myself. Worse, it was a shovel full of shit to the face. Never have I felt so disrespected before in film history.<br><br>Here's a question that I want answered: Why the f*** would I ever watch a Star Wars move after this one again? There is nothing left, no story thread worth pursuing. Anything that was interesting from this universe has been erased. Every character that made Star Wars iconic has been killed, and in a very unsatisfactory manner. <br><br>This film goes out of it's way to insult the viewer. Maybe the prequels weren't going to win any Oscars, but at least I didn't feel like George Lucas wanted to punch me in the face, or that he despised me and wanted me to suffer. They are masterpieces in comparison to this garbage. <br><br>The writers of this film obviously have a deep, bitter, seething resentment. They take it out on the fanbase (no surprise as to them probably 80% of Star Wars fans are old school straight males). Superfeminist Kathleen Kennedy and gay man Rian Johnson have a vendetta against the viewer, and they really go out of their way to make us suffer, probably for the crime of being born.<br><br>Let me say I don't give a damn about politics. I'm a liberal, I believe in letting anyone do whatever the hell they want, as long as they don't bother me. I wish films could be free of political agendas but sadly this is becoming less and less common in our world.<br><br>The creators sacrificed good storytelling in lieu of pushing an agenda. The story is pathetic, badly told, full of plotholes and pointless. It has no beginning, middle or end. They do not even mildly follow the story of TFA. It's like a reboot of a reboot, no continuity whatsoever. There is a casino planet full of evil white people (I challenge you to find any "diversity" amongst the tuxedo-wearing, stuck up , wealthy patrons), an asian chick that has no point in existing. Even Finn's character was butchered, reverting into the coward he was in the beginning of TFA.<br><br>But the biggest coward of all is Luke Skywalker. Things got rough so he fled the known galaxy, spending his days cut off from the force, doing practically nothing and milking the tits of a purposefully disgusting, revolting, alien just to survive. Luke, who defeated Vader and was a hero of the rebellion, who stood unarmed before the emperor with no fear, left his sister alone to fight against evil. Even when he found out his best friend Han Solo, (who on several occasions saved Luke's life), was killed, he just cries and whines some more, and remains unmoved. <br><br>Our childhood hero, the eternal optimist and the bravest soul in the galaxy, was absolutely and completely butchered. Quoting Mark Hamill, "This is not Luke anymore. Maybe it's Jake Skywalker, but he's not my Luke Skywalker." He was purposefully humiliated, and his character destroyed.<br><br>I will never watch a movie from these filmakers ever again. If someone enters your house, smashes your toys and shits on your rug, that is not "being bold"; that is insulting. You never invite that person over again.<br><br>These movies are statement pieces, nothing more. They are meant to deconstruct cultural icons, trash them, and replace them with concepts of "diversity", and "feminism". They destroy Luke because he symbolizes classic heroism,and knighthood, embodied in a simple man. Cultural Marxists abhore tradition, traditional mythology, and traditional ideals. Destroy the world, and rebuild it into what you want it to be. They clearly state for you exactly what they want to do with this franchise; let the past die... kill it if you have to.?<br><br>Avoid at all costs.

 I am not going to give this movie a half a star like so many other people are, but let me first just say that this is the worst SW film of all time. It's even worse than Attack of the Clones. Yes, really. <br><br>The movie itself is shot well and is visually fantastic. The sound effects and soundtrack are on point. That's basically all this movie has going for it. I literally only signed up for Rotten Tomatoes so I could review this movie. I am a life-long SW fan and own all of the movies, played basically all of the video games, and I have also read dozens of the books. I am a bit of a super fan you could say. <br><br>TLJ suffers from a number of problems. There are serious plot holes, plot elements which simply do not make sense, failed attempts at humor that come off as immersion-breaking rather than genuinely funny, and oh so much social/political pandering. Every woman in the movie is a strong, brave badass leader type and pretty much all of the men are bumbling idiots or totally evil. I don't care that the movie ran long, but what I do care about is that a lot of what is in the movie is utterly pointless and doesn't serve to further the plot. The character development in this film is basically non-existent. You learn absolutely nothing whatsoever about Snoke before he is killed. NOTHING! You learn nothing about Rey aside from the fact that her parents were poor nobodies, yet she is able to knock Jedi Master Luke Skywalker to the ground in a duel and master basically everything she attempts to do with virtually no training whatsoever. The existing Star Wars storyline before Disney bought Lucas out was fantastic and could have provided material for dozens of movies taking place after the original trilogy and even thousands of years before and everywhere inbetween. Disney rendered almost all of it non-canon and now we are left with a lukewarm bowl of poop soup. <br><br>I could go on and on and on detailing every stupid thing wrong with this movie but I am sure those points have been mentioned countless times by other reviewers. I'll sum it up like this:<br><br><br>PROS:<br>-great visuals<br>-great sound/soundtrack<br>-old school puppet Yoda<br>-some good battle scenes both in space and lightsaber duels<br><br><br>CONS:<br>-terrible character decisions make by Disney / Johnson<br>-weak dialogue<br>-no character development at all<br>-numerous inane plot holes<br>-pointless quests that people go on that just waste screen time<br>-sociopolitical pandering <br>-feminist agenda b.s. <br>-new uses of the Force never seen before that simply do not make sense<br>-some parts were very confusing and didn't make sense <br>-classic characters like R2D2, Chewbacca, C3PO, and others under-utilized<br>-unlikeable and/or annoying new characters (Rose in particular), 1.5,  Vincent B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977053566/

 I saw the last showing of THE LAST JEDI at my local theater before it was replaced this weekend one month after it's release. It's a small theater. <br>Everything STAR WARS about this film seems to be stripped down to its bare bones with a few basic plots developing as a primary and secondary nervous system, then the body is being rebuilt with the same genetic coding but due to different environmental factors the final entity is coming out looking quite different. It also seems due to the inclusion of the aging previous generation this film is growing out grey in its philosophy of the Force. <br>Failure and learning from failure seems to be what this movie's about. Characters make illogical choices, which turn to mistakes that must be dealt with. Some of the survivors learn from their errors. Coping with, and even accepting failure, is a tough story for the characters. Not everyone makes mistakes in the film. Some have mentors to guide them out of their failure. Rey's story arc is an organic exploration of the Light and the world around her, and the Dark and herself. <br>Tonal shifts, from seriousness to comedic, raging anger to laughter, emphasize the struggle for balance between the Light Side and the Dark Side. Some of the comedy is dark comedy. <br>Some character choices and revelations refreshingly clear the air of speculation. Of course I had my theories about a few things based on the previous seven episodes. For example Rey's parents. Rey as Luke's kid would've been the obvious guess. My more radical guess, she was a clone of Anakin Skywalker with the Y chromosome changed to an X so she wouldn't be noticeable as an Anakin clone. But her origins are none of those. Not everyone important needs to be a prince or princess. Some people can rise to notoriety from nowhere. The direction the film does take, the galaxy feels open to the possibility that Force users could pop up from anywhere. <br>I also like how Kylo has chosen to be irredeemable. His mother, uncle, and Rey have given up on him. Even if he begs for forgiveness now in the IXth episode, they may not forgive him. When Hux found Kylo lying on the ground and reached inside his coat, was one of the best small actions in the film. <br>It has space combat, hand-to-hand combat, starships, alien worlds, alien creatures, the Force, and characterization. This fantasy/scifi space adventure is fun, moody, desperate, some thrills, and exciting. There's blatant and subtle uses of the Force. The Light and the Dark. What I take away from this episode is that decisions and consequences are unique to each character. The story also takes refreshing and unexpected turns, which help distinguish these characters and this episode. As much as they talk about hope, there're still only as many resistance fighters as can fit in the small freighter as they fly off in the end., 4.5,  Eric W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976574572/
 Snoke ended up being a cookie cutter villain, and Kylo Ren is one the most underwhelming villains I've ever seen., 1.0,  David C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977053580/
 There is so much wrong with this movie it's hard to decide where to begin. So I'll just give a basically a list of my main complaints. The first half of this film is a bloated, disjointed mess that has minimal influence over the second half of the film. The main conflict of the first half moves at a snails pace, apparently to give enough time for an additional handful of subplots that ultimately go nowhere. Character decisions must have been made based off a roll of the dice instead of the situations presented in the story. The few crumbs of character growth are forced and not natural. There seemed to be a push to add as much humor as possible, which most of the jokes were out of place and fell flat. On top of being just a bad movie in general, it also wasn't a very satisfying star wars movie. It has very little regard for any star wars material preceding it ( including TFA). Characters don't behave as has been established, they don't use Star Wars "physics", OT characters are dispatched like they are in Game of Thrones. It doesn't even feel like a Star Wars movie. Which some may argue is a good thing but I can't agree that opinion. In summary this neither succeeded at being a good movie or an enjoyable Star Wars movie., 1.0,  Robert K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/964732538/

 The Last Jedi is fantastic. It goes to new places brilliantly, and brings familiarity with finesse. Fantastic performances and excellently directed. This is the most ambitious Star Wars film to date and it pays off in a big way.

 **SPOILER FREE REVIEW**<br>I have now seen this film three times: with my younger brothers (11 &amp; 14), with my parents (late 40s) and with my girlfriend (21). All of us loved it and it got better every viewing. The action was exciting, the cinematography was beautiful, the humour was funny (a lot of complaints about this, I didn't find it to be the case at all), and the story continued the journey well.<br><br>Many complaints are about Luke's character, I found him to be engaging, more so than the original trilogy in which he was relatively boring character-wise. He is different, but why is that a surprise considering all that has happened? All of the characters have been progressed and enriched by this film. The plot holes are easily explained and are no more significant than in any of the other films.<br><br>To conclude, The Last Jedi was a thrilling ride from beginning to end, moving the Star Wars universe forward in an unexpected, but necessary, direction. Everyone I've spoken to loved it, don't dwell too much on internet opinions. One minor qualm is that a subplot was extended dragged on slightly, but aside from that, it was great., 4.5,  James T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977053215/

 The allegation that all the terrible user reviews are politically motivated, work of white supremist groups is a laughably poor excuse to explain the movie going public's disgust with reviewers who have clearly been bought off or pressured into giving poor films great reviews.<br><br>Read the average review by an average fan-critic and they will explain the numerous lazy, illogical places the script leaps off the rails. Del Toro's role, which took up a sizeable chunk in the middle dealing with a casino, was a completely needless Mcguffin. The "romance" in this film was laughable fan boy junk. There was absolutely no attempt whatsoever to build any convincing back story (or tell one) regarding most of these characters. Virtually zero. It seemed like a rush to get in all of these different characters into the film and then consider the diverse reach and merchandising opportunities selling them.<br><br>This is certainly the last Jedi. The spirit and the care in crafting characters we get to know and care about is lost in this film. It's all about "images" - we can pit a female white hero, a black hero, an Asian hero, a white knowitall, an alien villain without having to explain a darn thing about what magical Force it is that protects them... other than the need for a sequel.

 An obvious political agenda with the propaganda in this movie. If you want to spread your political agenda at least do it from within the context of the story. Disney ruined an entire franchise.

 This was a good entertaining movie. However, this was not the GREAT movie that the star wars series deserves. I really wished that they told a star wars story that flowed and made sense. I have no problem with any political undertones, the side of the rebels has always been an inclusive side. I just wished it was a story that made the star wars universe seem like such a large, genuine place like the other movies did. This film doesn't make sense and it is a knock to the star wars series. It was entertaining the first time through but I will not be re-watching., 2.0,  Nick D, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/937177323/
 All I want to say is that it is not a bad star wars movie. Its a garbage movie cinematographicly speaking. And im not a die-hard-the-original-triology-is-the-best-fan.Every production has its flaws as it is normal. But this one...JEEZ. Im a fan of movies in general and this was just a disaster. I entered the cinema with 0 expectations and still came out pissed. Useless, annoying and random characters doing useless, annoying and random sh*t, the so called "war" was the first order army versus a few petty resistance ships, still didnt explain why Rey is so goddamn overpowered, dumb, out of the blue situations that were just there for no reason (freeing the animals on the casino planet for example), Snoke's death was pathetic, Luke became the Joker, Yoda firing lightnings and topless Kylo...seriously? These are just some thing that literally crashed in front of me and made the movie...just bad. And lets not forget the capital cinematographic failure of the year, the scene with princess Leia in space. You cant just make this sh*it up, nor can I forgive it for existing. At least if it had some cool saber fights, but no, just slo-mo clumsy swinging. To conclude, I consider this movie to be an absolute attrocity, regardless of it being Star Wars or not., 0.5,  Roshko G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/950437648/
 Visually stunning. Outstanding score. Beyond that, it's an abomination. <br><br>Episode VIII will have the same effect on Episode IX as Batman vs Superman had on Justice League. &lt; $700 million in box office revenue and fighting to reach the black.<br><br> I will never pay to see another Star Wars film unless Disney wakes up and replaces the executive team at Lucasfilm and their ironically-named "Story Group"., 0.5,  Scott B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977053032/
 I won't dig in every single detail and nitpick everything I find silly in this movie. The main thing it has going for it are visual effects. The real problem with this movie is the writing. The jokes mostly fall flat, the character's reactions to events are odd. But don't take my word for it, Mark Hamill said ''I fundementaly disagree with virtually everything you've decided about my character'' to Rian Johnson. Hamill is an excellent actor who has played this role for decades. This to me, sums up the movie's writing., 2.0,  Louis-Albert L, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/975144816/

 I didn't particularly like TFA (mostly because of Rey, but other elements as well). But I didn't think it was too bad considering that ep VIII might explain some things. And explain them it did, in a way that just screams lazy screenwriting to me. Rey continues to be a massive Mary Sue, and even more so than in TFA. Poe is shown as an idiot even though all of the actions he took were the correct ones. And purple hair lady (I do not remember her name) is not just one of the worst movie characters I have ever seen, but also the worst admiral to have ever existed. Luke died in an extremely unsatisfactory way, and there wasn't a single lightsaber duel in the entire movie. And then there's Snoke, who for being so incredibly powerful sure seems like a nobody. Nothing about him is explained. <br>Basically TFA was bad, but it could have been redeemed and explained in this movie. It wasn't, not even in the slightest. I feel bad for JJ because of what he has to clean up now. None of his plot points were even remotely addressed by Rian Johnson and the movie is just a huge disappointment overall. The only good thing about it are the special effects, but that is to be expected of Star Wars, so they don't get any extra score for that., 1.0,  Tim N, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977052983/

 Spoilers: a bloated movie made for the sake of twists had so many poorly developed characters and illogical story-lines. Massive plot holes such as gravity bombing in space. Fleets run by reactors running out fuel after 1 hyperspace jump. All-powerful bond-movie like villain that can do anything except for seeing the lighsaber next to him spinning to point at him.

 I walked out of the theater feeling satisfied, but after a few days of contemplation I realized that Disney succeeded in accomplishing a near-impossible feat: they actually managed to polish a turd. Looks great, sounds great, even feels great at first...but when you strip away all the trimmings and glossy overcoat - you find one of the most absurd, nonsensical, soulless, universe-destroying piles of dung in cinema. The Last Jedi feels nothing like a Star Wars movie, and now I'm left feeling like, when all is said and done, the new trilogy will pale in comparison to the prequels., 1.0,  Molnar D, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/963728837/
 Far superior to The Force Awakens in every way, this movie feels like an entry to Star Wars that isn't a rehash of what we have seen before. Instead, this is a harder tale of friendship, teaching, love and death with a darker vibe on the ongoing war. The character of Ren is much more relatable in this movie and Poe/Finn bring a wonderful dynamic to the series, in much the same way that Solo/Chewbacca did. A worthy entry to the series., 4.5,  Nate J, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/909840246/

 As visually stunning as this movie is, it can not make up for its flaws in virtually all other departments.

 Ruined Star Wars forever. I've been a lifelong fan. I had all the action figures growing up (during the remastered original trilogy release). All the toys. I played the shit out of SWTOR, read expanded universe material (Shadows of the Empire, The Thrawn trilogy) and some graphic novels. Watched all of Clone Wars cartoon series (never got around to Rebels). I'm a defender of the prequels. However, I will NOT be seeing the 9th entry of the Sykwalker series in theaters. Disneys has irrevocably ruined this universe. Luke Skywalker's character arc was completely destroyed (and made no sense), weaponized lightspeed negates all warfare in the universe as we've known it, and none of the women in the movie eared their abilies/power (asian chick, purple-hair chick, Mary-Sue Rey, Mary-Poppins Leia). If I mentioned everything wrong with this movie I'd be here all day and this post would be a novel. I will say, it looked awesome. That's the only kind thing I have to say. If you're distracted by shiny objects and don't care about the Star Wars Universe at all, then give this movie a watch. Otherwise, please don't give Disney your money. Rian Johnson can go to hell., 0.5,  Kevin I, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976931289/
 One of my favorites. I think it is okay to dislike this movie, but for the audience to rate it worse than the phantom menace is ridiculous. I personally liked the twists and Mark Hamill had an amazing performance. Rey and Kylo had an amazing connection throughout the film. people need to stop getting on the where did snoke come from train. We didn't know anything about the Emperor until the prequels and no one had a problem with him.

 Star Wars The Last Jedi was the film set to right all of the wrongs of The Force Awakens and the prequels, while also promising to be satisfying to fans old and new.

The Last Jedi takes many of the complaints of the previous films and has a knee-jerk reaction, going so far the other way that the film has completely divided its faithful source of income, its fanbase. While trying to be something for everyone, it has stretched itself out to the point of losing what made the original trilogy and to some extent parts of the prequels so beloved.<br><br>Parts of the film are good, even enjoyable to watch, but for every time there is a scene that is a love letter to the fans, there are two dear John letters right after it, stabbing the viewer in the back after getting the fans to let their guard down.<br><br>Considering the financial success that The Last Jedi is, the inevitable sequel to it has a lot to make up for to earn back the broken trust of many of its fans., 2.0,  Caleb J, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977051689/
 Loved the original trilogy, was expecting something different with the prequels, and mildly liked Force Awaken even though it felt like a ripp off. <br><br>Last Jedi is a total disgrace on an epic level.

Totally uninterested in seeing any Star Wars movie ever again. Thats how bad Last Jedi is!

 Not a perfect film by any sense, and I understand a lot of the criticism but I don't agree with most of it. Canto Bight was for the most part unnecessary / could have been done better, Rey's powers need serious explanation, but every other criticism I've seen for the film can be explained away. <br>Finn / Rose: established at the beginning that Rose sees Finn as a hero. They have a fun (from the characters' perspectives) adventure together. Rose experiences a whirlwind of emotion from the loss of her sister, hopelessness of the Resistance fleet, elation of being their potential saviour, being locked up in jail, freeing all the horse things, almost completing their mission, almost being killed, crash landing back with the Resistance, and being on the frontline suicide mission to stop the First Order. In one day she goes from being a technician to an adrenaline fuelled hero of the Resistance, the whole time joined by Finn. Of course she's gonna feel some strong emotions towards him by the end, and he clearly didn't kiss her back in that moment because he's not as overwhelmed as she is having experienced all of this before<br>Luke: having put a stop to the Empire and established his own order in peaceful (ish) times for about 20 years or so, one day it dawns on him that evil is back. and it's his nephew. he raised a school to be the next generation, he's old, he's already dealt with all this shit before, he's sick of his family turning evil, for a very brief moment he's consumed by darkness (just like that time he exploded at his dad and very almost killed him). this darkness lasts about 5 seconds, whereas last time it was a good couple of minutes. that's a pretty big improvement I'd say, and even Luke Skywalker can't be a perfect man with no mistakes. anyway his mistake costs him his nephew, all his students, everything he's worked so hard to build for a couple of decades. makes sense to me that he'd be sick of this shit and runs away from it all. from his perspective he's just created Vader 2, and he saw first hand what Vader 1 did. surprised he didn't kill himself after that tbh. as for the ending, it's already established that Rey couldn't be behind her and Kylo's link because she's "not powerful enough, it would destroy (her)". so to project oneself across the entire galaxy, to the entire resistance and first order troops, for so long, through the power of the mind, especially after only just reconnecting to the force after a good few years, is probably a SUPER hard thing to do<br>Holdo / Poe: Poe was demoted to captain after getting a load of people killed, he's in no authority to be disclosed every piece of information. simple as that<br>Snoke: Just like the Emperor in ep 5 &amp; 6, there was no time or relevance in this story to delve into who this guy is. There'll be a comic series or a book devoted to that, which all the hardcore fans can read because the average movie goer probably doesn't care that much anyways<br>Porgs: after the entire galaxy was saved by Ewoks, I'm surprised there's anything said about the little things that did nothing major for the story other than making Chewie feel a little guilty. Course they were made to sell toys, but at least they weren't the reason the First Order was defeated<br>Timeline: Rey and Luke's arc was clearly picked up from the second TFA ended, but there's no reason to suggest there wasn't at least a week in between Rey leaving the Resistance and the First Order finding them. It's perfectly plausible that the chase sequence arc started a few days after the Rey / Luke arc, which also explains Finn's recovery<br>Super Leia: yeah, it looked dumb as hell. but it's always been established that Leia's in touch with the force, and despite other movies showing the opposite, it's scientifically accurate that you wouldn't die the second you enter space. Not that Star Wars needs to be, or has ever been entirely scientifically accurate. also when entering the ship again, the smoke when the door opens suggests an air lock to me. I'd need to watch again to know if that's the case<br>Blue milk: the way I read this the very first time I saw it, was Luke staring into Rey's eyes to say "look how gross I am. fuck off"<br>Poe / Hux joke: Han did something very similar when they broke Leia out of detention cell 2187. Hux was dumb but it's been established outside of the movies that he gained his position because of his dad, and likes to take a back seat in war. He's supposed to be a pathetic slimy dirtbag <br>I'll admit, Phasma was a waste again, Kylo's abdomen injury was forgotten (or perhaps fixed offscreen because do you need to see every single detail?), some of the CGI was jarring, DJ was a whatever character and the tone was very distracting at times. But I'd happily watch this movie every day if I had to and still enjoy it, 4.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977051704/
 The film that finally killed Star Wars. <br><br>What can I say. My love for this amazing story started in 1977 and grew as Empire and then Jedi were released.<br> <br>When Timothy Zahn's novels came out (the REAL Episodes 7-9) it brought back the magic. <br><br>When the Episode I was released, there were some things I definitely had a hard time with but we got Maul... Qui-Gon Jinn... a plotting Palpatine... John Williams amazing score... and spectacular lightsaber battles. And with Episode 3, we actually got some great moments of drama, emotion and pathos.<br><br>When Force Awakens came out, I had high hopes.<br>For me, it was Rogue One that alerted me that something was wrong... that Disney was cynically exploiting our affection for Star Wars to push its agendas and ideologies. <br><br>Then Last Jedi came out... and that was it. <br>As Luke said in Return of the Jedi: "Then you are truly dead.", 0.5,  Martin%20 H, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977051737/
 It's just plain and simply terribly written. I had formed an opinion of Ruin Johnson after watching his most famous piece of work to date 2012's Looper. That opinion being that he has no original ideas in his storytelling. Decades ago when cars were not as sophisticated as they are today, crooked dealerships would create one new car by welding together two totalled cars and they were called cut'n'shuts. Ruin Johnson does this cut'n'shut technique with well known blockbusters. Taking the good stuff from Matrix, Terminator, Akira (manga) etc. And he distracts you with these selling points and the end result is you can remember what you thought going in to the movie but you sure don't remember the story arc of his film. All because he just cannot tell a good story! Soon as I heard they let him write his own story for Star Wars The Last Jedi I knew he was not up the the caliber of director such a movie deserves. This new generation of movie goers are satisfied with well done cgi and set pieces and the basic story telling is not of high importance. Star Wars just seriously deserved more than what a rookie director writer like Ruin Johnson, 0.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976961397/

 If you see this movie, you will be treated to really gorgeous effects and a great soundtrack, with solid performances by Mark Hamill and Adam Driver. There are many scenes and sequences that are exciting, and there are interesting new places and creatures. But overall, not much happens. Which just makes this a flashy, yet forgettable throwaway. And if you aren't a Star Wars fan, you can go see it on that basis and be relatively entertained. But for fans, this is a much more mixed proposition, and for a movie that is part of a series... it does not succeed. Any questions set up from the last movie (The Force Awakens) are dismissed with utter laziness from a story-telling perspective. The phrase from the trailer "this I not going to go the way you think" seems like a weapon aimed at assaulting Star Wars fans by giving them nothing to fulfill any expectations. Instead you get a ho-hum plot and incongruous character portrayals. The pace of the main action (chasing rebels through space) is slow and dull, and makes all the leaders (both rebel and first order) appear incompetent and absurd. There is also a habit of disrupting any true interesting tension being built in the story with the insertion of dumb jokes, negating any sense that any of it matters - making it hard to conjure up any real interest or investment in the story on the part of the viewer. The truly sad part is that this movie minimizes and subverts the old characters, especially Luke Skywalker. If the new characters grew or did anything interesting, perhaps you could forgive a bit. But that didn't happen either for the most part (Kylo perhaps being the exception). I think the filmmaker was aiming for "dark," but honestly the film is just depressing and certainly doesn't leave you wanting more. I think many fans will wish they had just stayed home to watch the old films and pretend this never happened., 2.0,  Lorey S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977051696/

 This is such a disappointment. I really, really wanted to like this movie but sadly it has, for me, failed to deliver. True, the last 30 minutes are spectacular but getting there is so verbose and tortuous that I almost gave up the will to live. There are certain aspects of the plot that could have been clever and exciting, but they are lost in stodgy, dull scenes in which nothing of consequence really happens meaning there is little sense of peril or excitement. I knew that there had to be a handing over of the Star Wars cannon from the old guard to the next generation and the previous instalment filled me with hope and expectation but The Last Jedi is a bitter disappointment. We have an overly wordy plot, some cheap, infantile laughs and some very poorly realised characters. Top of my list is the usually dependable Laura Dern as Admiral Holdo, the supposed battle hero who looks more like she should be advertising bath salts from the 1980s. Mark Hamill does himself no favours whatsoever either and is, frankly, annoying. As for poor Carrie Fisher, I can only assume she was shown an early cut on that flight back to LA.

 Somehow they managed to ruin everything that made the story established by The Force Awakens interesting. There was so much potential for the story, so many ways for it to develop in interesting ways, and this movie literally destroyed it all. I honestly don't know how they can have a sequel to this movie. It felt very final. I have no idea what they can do with the story now. This was the first Starwars movie I've ever seen that I wanted to end because of how bad it was. I literally didn't want to finish the movie. What a bummer., 0.5,  John D, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977052328/
 This movie was actually pretty bad in relation to the first several in the franchise. There were kids (lots of them), a Naval admiral dressed in a formal gown (that is, no uniform), and several CUTE scenes.

 I enjoyed The Last Jedi. I don't have an essay to write, but it did feel like Star Wars to me, and I walked out excited to see what happens next. The original trilogy has been put on a far higher pedestal than it deserves, and now these films suffer from overhyped expectations. It was a good movie.

 Enough has been said. The people behind this movie has no respect for the franchise. Even Mark Hamill hates it. They should apologize and declare it non-canon then do it again, with Leia dying in that attack to the bridge, because that is the only way to pay due homage to Carrie Fisher.

 The Last Jedi is a rehash of Empire Strikes Back which starts where it ends, going absolutely nowhere. The film offers up heaping helpings of nostalgia, like a super group from the Seventies that have become parodies of them <br>selves. Disney of course is trying to please the prequelle <br><br>generation and in comparison, the Last Jedi soars. But, that does not make Jedi a good movie. My Thirteen year old son, who Disney is trying to sell on the franchise, thoughts the movie was just so so and pointed out the many plot holes. Regardless, as long as the Franchise continues to sell tickets and the critics on Disney's pay roll, continue to hype what gets churned out., we'll continue to get films that don't stray too far from the recipe. But each and every one will fail to capture the magic of the first and second films. And that's a shame., 1.5,  John P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977052199/
 A visually stunning mockumentary of the franchise not to be taken seriously.., 3.5,  Ryan G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/961365139/
 This was the worst Star Wars movie ever created, including the prequels. Uninteresting characters, poor acting, awkward humor, an incoherent plot, and I could go on and on. Save your money and your time. Go watch Rogue One again, whose creators were infinitely more inspired than those who came up with this Last Jedi steaming pile. It was so bad, it made the Force Awakens look decent by comparison., 1.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977052216/
 Rian Johnson did the impossible and made fans like George Lucas again. Lucas may have been inept as a storyteller when he created the prequels but at least he did not trample on everything that means anything to a SW fan. <br><br>The good bits first: Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver deliver great performances and their scenes together really worked. The Rashomon reference was very nice in principle but just didn't rhyme with Luke's established character. <br><br>A total lack of feel for established characters is where the deplorable misfortunes of TLJ start but not in the very least end. Given that Luke had risked his life based on a glimmer of hope that some good was left in his evil father, it just does not work to make him even consider killing Kylo Ren. <br><br>Yoda's brief appearance is exemplary for a number of systematic issues with TLJ: 1. Characters are used in a throw away manner. They appear from nowhere, are disrespected and disappear to nowhere again. No proper introduction, development, or closure. 2. Yoda's demeanour does not befit his established character. Instead of being a wise sage, he comes across as someone who has sniffed too much cocaine, commenting on the Jedi texts as "page turners they are not". 3. He is able to have an effect on the real world. This kind of playing loose with established rules of the SW universe(it happens a lot in TLJ) is not creative; it simply undermines everything that happened in all the episodes before. <br><br>Anything that seems to drive his twisted story or creates shock value appeared to be par for course for Rian Johnson, no matter how jarring the experience for anyone who cares about SW. If you were tasked with creating a skit that mocks SW, would you be able to come up with something more contemptuous than Luke throwing his light sabre over his shoulder? Would you be able to come up with scenes that are more absurd than Luke soiling himself with milk from a four-teated sea cow, or swinging from cliff to cliff with a preposterously long spear for no apparent gain? <br><br>Another major issue is that the numerous attempts at humour constantly misfire. The jokes are not just daft, targeting Kindergarten level, they just don't work. These constant misfires also destroy any kind of consistency of tone. The inflationary use of bathos may have become normal (in the sense of "regularly encountered") in today's flicks but it certainly has not become good. <br><br>One could go on and on about the many issues this film has. The script is filled with illogical scenes and decisions. Even if Rian Johnson did not trample on everything SW fans believe in and everything TFA had set up, the ridiculous script on its own would catapult any sensible audience out of their suspension of disbelief. <br><br>My gripe with TLJ is not that it did not fulfil my expectations. I had none. I did not read any extended universe literature, I did not follow any fan speculations, I did not even watch any of the trailers. I have no problem with a struggling Luke either. My problem is that the film itself is just bad. Like the prequels, it completely and utterly failed to make me care about any of the characters for more than a split second. I liked the fledging relationship between Rey and Finn in TFA and loved their reunion in TLJ. But then Rian Johnson throws another spanner in the works by introducing Rose. Rose has no chemistry with Finn whatsoever but is artificially forced into the story as a new potential love interest. This makes as little sense as her egoistic stunt with which she prevents Finn from saving all his friends with a brain dead comment about not destroying what one hates, but saving what one loves. Wasn't Finn exactly trying to save the people he loved when Rose sabotaged his manoeuvre? Finn was not even targeting people. I'd be fully on board with a message along the lines of "stormtroopers have kids as well, so let's not kill them by the dozen if you can help it." However, Finn was just targeting a weapon. He was making a self-sacrifice (a well established theme not only in SW but all of literature and even used in TLJ) to disable a weapon. Was his alleged "hate" going to hurt the feelings of the battering ram? Let's not even contemplate as to why Rose and Finn even make it to this point under the bombardment of the First order, or how they get back safely unprotected across the battlefield. <br><br>It is a sad day, but TLJ managed to kill a saga not just for me, but for many, many fans. I couldn't care less what Disney does with Episode IV., 1.0,  Thomas K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/906328817/

 Holy shit what a fucking film I love it. Star Wars the last jedi was one of the most incredible and outstanding films I ever watch in my life it had a lot of twists and so many answers you have to put them like a puzzle and I understand it when i put them together plus so much sci-fi action in this and so many creatures I really love the progs they are so cute and you got to love the light saber battles and the blaster battles as well. very artistic the film as well with the set pieces in the film and of course lovable characters from the force awakens and luke skywalker the best jedi ever and I fucking love it. Overall Star Wars the last jedi was one of the best star wars film i ever watch I don't care what people say about the are not true fans of the saga only true fans love the films like I do but what a film and just fucking love it. Well done director Rian Johnson you made a well crafted masterpiece of a sci-fi film and the best trilogy I ever love in my life. well done and good fucking best star wars film ever. rest in piece Carrie fisher and my the force be with you,always., 5.0,  David G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/965981562/
 This is such a disappointment. I really, really wanted to like this movie but sadly it has, for me, failed to deliver. True, the last 30 minutes are spectacular but getting there is so verbose and tortuous that I almost gave up the will to live. There are certain aspects of the plot that could have been clever and exciting, but they are lost in stodgy, dull scenes in which nothing of consequence really happens meaning there is little sense of peril or excitement. I knew that there had to be a handing over of the Star Wars cannon from the old guard to the next generation and the previous instalment filled me with hope and expectation but The Last Jedi is a bitter disappointment. We have an overly wordy plot, some cheap, infantile laughs and some very poorly realised characters. Top of my list is the usually dependable Laura Dern as Admiral Holdo, the supposed battle hero who looks more like she should be advertising bath salts from the 1980s. Mark Hamill does himself no favours whatsoever either and is, frankly, annoying. As for poor Carrie Fisher, I can only assume she was shown an early cut on that flight back to LA.

 I don't like what they've done to Luke Skywalker. The once enduring hero of the entire Star Wars brand whose rise from an obscure feeble boy to overcome insurmountable odds and unimaginable cosmic adversity, rose to eliminate all evil and restored order to the galaxy.<br>This was only made possible because he himself arrived at the pinnacle of his highest potential, as is the Jedi Master. Established as one with the inner all pervading, ever present indomitable force for all time. <br>Hence even his screen presence without a script in the previous movie was enough to empower the audience to a sense of the highest authority which one comes to expect within the full embodiment of all things associated with such a Master of the force. <br>The full value of Star Wars is built upon the unshakable principal that the highest good is found within a selfless heart that can and will overcome evil. And at the basis of everything there is a force within us that sustains all existence. By sacrificing the limitations of ones own divided intellect and submitting to the holistic force albeit under the enlightened tutelage of two Masters (Obe One &amp; Yoda) you are can rise to become One with the force. <br>Now Skywalkers character has been degraded from the all powerful timeless Master of all things to a disgruntled, dischevelled train wreck who accepts wise counsel from his novice disciple. May the force be with you...What a travesty! <br>Whilst it's the role of Hollywood to create drama the twists to this character has effectively thrown the very principles which made the Star Wars a franchise under the bus. <br>Hollywood might not rate too high on the topic of enduring core values. That's precisely why Star Wars has been world class franchise because the story until now had remained true to its values. <br>What a shame., 2.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977051576/
 ***SPOILERS***<br><br>I saw Episode IV in 1977 and consider it the best of them all.<br><br>Where to begin with this turd.<br><br>I get it, it's sci-fi fantasy. But there's a level of reality that must be kept otherwise why not have all the characters flying around like space angel Leia shooting space angel love beams at each other. This movie crosses that line multiple times.<br><br>Rose, I believe her first line is "I fix pipes", then goes on to piloting spaceships and fighters. Apparently in that galaxy far far away pilots are not in great need because every lowly shlub can pilot. Very uninteresting character.<br><br>Finn, no wonder the first order is doomed, everyone in that organisation from high to low knows all their secrets, secret codes, when the codes change, how often they change, layout of ships, how to navigate through ships, weaknesses of ships. I Like the character, but honestly what role would a once lowly stormtrooper have after joining the rebellion other than being their version of a ground pounder.<br><br>Raye, she's just a hobo and with no training squares off with multiple personal guards of Snoke, and wins. Just a repeat of the last movie where she takes on Ren/Ben and bests him. Like the actress and character, just needs more attention to detail.<br><br>Kylo Ren/Ben, most uninteresting main bad guy ever. Really whiney, kind of like young Vader. Hux was more interesting, Tarkin was more interesting and his only memorable line was "you may fire when ready". I actually fist pumped when Snoke yelled at him to take that stupid mask off...I couldn't understand a word he was saying.<br><br>Luke, thought Hamill did a good job.<br><br>Benecio Del Toro, good character, reminds me of the kind of people Han Solo would run around with except maybe a step or two worse.<br><br>Fairly dopey and uninspiring speeches scattered throughout in an attempt to bolster morale, some painful to listen to.<br><br>Some funny parts, some parts tried to be funny but were lame. Whoever came up with the holding for Hux part should be punched in the face repeatedly and never allowed near a Star Wars movie again.<br><br>The movie breaks down into 3 boss battles, there should really only be one:<br><br>First, dreadnought is destroyed by level bombers...in space. last I heard bombs don't drop in space. They've managed to figure out how to travel at the speed of light but not how to create stand-off fire and forget missles.<br><br>Second, battering ram, happens to take just enough time to charge up so the heroes can swoop in to destroy it...except miracle pilot Rose stopped it from happening, can't have Finn dead and she managed to survive too.<br><br>Third, Snokes giant ship and the entire first order fleet wiped out by Laura the miracle general/pilot Dern. Advice to rebellion, just make drones out of your giant ships and hyperspace them through your enemies...saves lives. Don't worry, you can move your people around in cloaked dinghies because that's apparently a widely available technology, not sure why everyone doesn't use it if you can put it on dopey escape shuttles.<br><br>At what point do the bad guys go "Hey, I've noticed everything we build gets vaporized due to some stupid design flaw, lets focus on fixing that"?<br><br>Apparently the movie is an advertisement for PETA, SJW and child trafficking. Poor animals, people are so evil. Poor kids, evil adults, someone cue up Randy Watson singing children are our future. Female characters, evil males get put in their place, hell even Poe gets slapped. What the creators did is blatantly obvious. Because it's obvious that makes it forced and unconvincing. If they didn't try so hard then it might have worked. Back in 1977 before all this nonsense, Leia was a great female character in episode IV. You thought "Oh a princess needing saved", then quickly came to realize she was much more. Now every female in the movie has to try to be a tough guy.<br><br>My intention was not to see the movie just so I could be that guy.

 It looks like a star wars movie, it feels like a star wars movie, it can be enjoyed like a star wars movie, but something fills off , there is something that stops it from actually being a star wars movie.... oh yes... killing frekkin Luke Skywalker before he had an actual normal lightsaber duel, or ...

 This is very heart wrenching to say this, about something I have beloved so dearly since a young child. Last Jedi is the absolute worst SW's movie in the history of the franchise. <br><br>I don't even know where to begin. Everything from the bizarre, depressing portrayal of Luke Skywalker, to the uneventful backstory of both Snoke and Rey, the horrible plot lines, unimaginative storytelling, to the unsexy weird love triangle between Finn, Rey, and Rose. The comic relief was cringy at best, and anyone over the age of 25, could easily see a huge leftist political agenda being shoved down the throats of the audience.<br><br>The artwork and the special effects in TLJ, are nothing short of spectacularly beautiful. The action sequences are nothing short of thrillingly fantastic. Hats off to Rian Johnson and the art/special effects team for delivering a visual masterpiece. <br><br>What TLJ makes up for in art and action, it's lack of depth and emotion are about as shallow as the Gobi desert in mid summer. Sure the movie is a thrill ride, but there's no guys and glory. There's nothing fantastic, nothing magical and mysterious leading you up to the drop off, instead it just immediately drops off. <br><br>It would be the equivalent of going to an amusement park and the every ride you get on just immediately drops to second you sit down. There's no long pull upwards looking down at your possible impending doom, there's no looking around at the majestic world around you to get caught up in, as you begin to feel like a God climbing to the heavens above. There's no dragging you and any of the characters through the "muck". Therefore you don't get emotionally attached to any of the characters in TLJ, I never once felt despair or pain, or fear, or happiness and joy for anyone. <br><br>Infact the only two emotions I could muster up the entire film, was anger and frustration at the writers, directors, and producers of this poorly crafted film. I guess you could say Rian Johnson really brought the "Darkside" out me. I'm not sure if that's a good thing, considering I had high hopes for this trilogy. <br><br>My 8 and 5 year old children could have told a better story. I could have written and produced a more emotionally in-depth movie, and I know countless of other Star Wars fans who could have did it even better than myself. Rian Johnson deserves the credit he gets, which is for making something pretty to look at. Everything else is just a travesty. I would advise anyone who is a long time SW's fan to save your hard earned dollars if you don't want to see your dreams shot down in flames. Which brings me to another point.<br><br>I understand they want to do away with the old and bring about the new, and I'm perfectly fine with that as long as it's done the correct way. However, it wasn't done the correct and honest way. It was done as a quick cash grab, which is aggravating. There was no homage paid to Luke, or any of the old heroes. Where was the lightsaber battle for Luke? What the heck happened to his hope? You can't get me to believe? that Kylo Ren, who at best a lesser powerful Darth Maul, could turn the most hopeful Jedi in the galaxy, into a despaired hopeless hermit. You're talking about the guy you turned one of the most powerful and evil sith lord, back to the light side. <br><br>I didn't have a problem with the astral projection tie in with the force. I thought it was a cool idea, yet it was poorly executed. I also have a problem with Rey and her unmatched skills. You're telling me that an amateur at best, beats Kylo Ren? Which is why I can't take Kylo Ren serious, and why I say he's at best a lesser powerful Darth Maul. You also make her best, Luke??? Why don't you just go ahead and hand her the victory on a silver platter, and hand Kylo Ren a trophy for participation... Rey is like a Jedi God, she can do no wrong, she has no trouble but only triumph. I want to see her suffer, so I can feel for her character, I want to love Rey as a hero. I want to go through her pain and tragedy, and her joy and victory. <br><br>What was up with the casino scene? That whole gimmick was just a terrible time filler, which could have been used to show Luke training Rey! That whole casino scene was probably one of the worst scenes in the history of cinematography. Totally unnecessary, and boring.<br><br>Snoke, where do you even start with this guy? Wow, what a let down. We wait two years and all we get is about 15 minutes of an old man in a golden bath robe, showing off extremely powerful skills only to be cut in half? Where's his backstory? Who the heck was he, and how did he rise to power after Vader and Sidious died? <br><br>There were so many really good angles they could have took when dealing with Snoke. What about the Darth Plagueis theory? What about the Jar Jar Binks sith Lord theory and tying in the prequels? What about the theory about Snoke being a master of both the light and dark? Why were all of these awesome theories, just brushed aside like nothing matters?<br><br>The Last Jedi, had the potential to be the best SW's movie ever, it had the chance to the everything together, and it fell short due to whatever insane reasons Rian Johnson had in mind. The Star Wars franchise was a franchise, that seemed like it would be impossible to ever drop the ball with. However that's exactly what was done here. <br><br>What's sad, is not only did Disney drop the ball, they might as well just destroyed the franchise. Maybe they're? looking to appeal to the younger generation, but they could have still done that and interwoven the old heroes in with the new, while eventually passing the torch.<br><br>What Disney and Rian Johnson did to Star Wars, is borderline blasphemy., 0.5,  Chris L, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977051343/

 My favorite Star Wars film of all time!! This movie has two of my absolute favorite Star Wars scenes and I'm old enough to have seen A New Hope in the theater 6 times.

 This movie is the worst star wars film and the only one that I have not enjoyed. They established and set up so many plots in the previous film (such as the knights of Ren) that they completely got rid of in this film.Luke Skywalker deserved better. Someone please explain to me how in the span of at most a couple of days the new republic fell. Rian Johnson should be fired. J.J.

 (5.5 out of 6)- The force that binds hope<br>When we see others don't give us a chance to revacuate when they see the time to strike is now to give little to no chance to get out. When what time others give us we see we return to those the thing that's there's, when they are wanted again to give the Jedi Order a chance in others. When what time we have left we see we don't have when others found new ways to limit our chances of escaping when they are able to detect and follow us. <br><br>When what time we see others have had to complete their training we give another chance. When what chance we have in proving ourselves, we see the time to retailiate is now. When what thoughts time can provide we see we don't have a chance in fulfilling the dark sides will when we fail to take out those who stand in our way. When what time brings to us is what we already possesed when we are the heir of a Jedi to use the force for another chance. When we see we have little chance when our weapons and machines are destroyed we see only to escape when time is all we have left. <br>*Rey's parents sold her? * Who sold the weapons? *Hyperspace tracking think tank since Rogue One<br><br>When what little time others have we see there training is complete when they have it in them already what they needed to see. When we see time ravishes us all to not give such things like the force a second chance when it has lead to so much destruction, death, and no use against the dark side. When we see that time away from such forces we see that we give a second chance when we need to see that special connection with those we miss &amp; love. When we see that the time for the Jedi is to end when we make sure no one gets a chance to manipulate or become one to destroy it all. When times of hope &amp; fear we see others make us see who we are to give us a chance at what we are meant to do when they have guided us along the way, when they are our master. <br><br>When what we see what others get a chance in becoming they see over time a connection they have with others like them to be bound by such unknowing connections. When such connections are manipulated into being real when the dark forces brings two in seeing souls to have a chance to join together when the time is right. When what we see is not what others saw to see that the dark side over time gives a chance to those to decide which side they want to be. When what time we feel others could become if we give them a chance to become one we try to kill, but see they are far too powerful when they are our nephew. When we see that what chance we have in winning is not within those on our side but those on the dark side when time is of the essence and we need those to join our side. <br>* Why doesn't the Dark Side know Luke's location through Rey? * Tarkin Initiative engineers perfected similar plans as in Rogue One * Erso &amp; TF?<br><br>When what we don't see in those who are far too powerful we see what they see is their time when such connections didn't happen by chance but by manipulation. When we don't see the powers of the energy the force brings when it's everything within everything that energy surrounds itself to control time and all chances we don't see but the force sees it before it happens. When we see that the force can't bring back those over time when they are our parents to have another chance at having a family. When we see that what we possess and feel that came from places over time that we were seen worthy to have a chance at possessing such power. When we don't see that the force has given the resistance a chance in us to fight for them when the time to fight back is now. When we don't see why the force chose us when it's given everyone a chance to become one with those guiding them over time to become one, when they are not heirs, or privileged, but those who see what's right and fight for what they believe in. <br><br>When what we see as too dark and powerful to stop, we see that there is not enough time or training to defeat those to have our chance as Supreme Leader to only make our chance and claim what is ours at the right time to strike those without looking. When we see we can join the dark side to give the chance we know is right to the resistance we see the last time those we tried to save. <br><br>When we see that there is no time to send those to places to give us a second chance when they got a plan. When what distress we are in we see the resistance destroyed or doesn't answer the call when loyalists see it's not their time to fight back. When we see a place full of chances when time stands still when your having too much fun, money and power to care in such places the galaxy goes to gamble. When our only chance lies with a codebreaker that buys us time to escape. When what we endup with are the limited chances when time only can get us in and out with the next best thing. When what we put our chances on we will see in time when time is important to us but money is to others. When being in such places we see what are chances are like when over time everyone in the galaxy has been supplying weapons to both sides to fight for profit. When we don't see another side to the galaxy when they manufacturer a war they see over time put their chances on the dark side to win when they are most profitable. When we see those we inspired but stuck in such places who believe in what we do is right but too young to fight, see over time their chance one day.<br><br>When we don't see the double Cross in those only looking for profit to see others don't see it as our time when they don't give us a chance to win. When what little chances we have we again rely on the best timing those we don't see saving us when they are mechanically inspicous. When what chance others in returning back to those who we were once under we see our time is ended to have a chance to fight them, when we fight for our side. When we see that such ideas for second chances didn't work to resort to our last possible chance when time and great leadership can only buy us that much for us to escape. When others must stay and command we see they give us a second chance when they sacrifice their life to buy us time to escape. <br><br>When we see we reach places in time to have another chance to fight. When what doesn't want us to have another chance when their out numbered, out machined, out weaponed and out of time to escape, we see we choose to runaway, buy time or fight to the end. When we see those return to give us a chance, buy us some time, make right with those who we haven't lost and do what we are meant to do when all hope is about to be gone, fight back.<br><br>When we see what chances we hold, when time has given us something to be in a place of great happiness that the light side still exist, that there are those willing to sacrifice their life for it, that there are now others who bring hope, and fulfill our roles when they believe in us as much as we believe in them. When we see that it's not time to end the Jedi when time has given us a second chance to make those a Jedi. When we see it's too late to save those who have no chance or time to join us to show the dark side our power. When what time and chances we are given to escape, reach such places and regroup we see what the force bound everything together, from those unlikely souls meeting and saving one another, to those finding their way through the dark side and back, to those knowing when to fight, when to escape and find away out and those that guide us from our past to the present, who were right by us at the right time to give the resistance another chance., 4.5,  Galvy F, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/971257172/
 Enough has been said about why this movie sucks.<br>But what about Rotten Tomatoes manipulation of the audience score?<br><br>Below, I've CUT and PASTE an important analysis form "Wes B."<br>And keep in mind, he's INCLUDING all the suspicious '5 star' scores left by user account which don't exist!<br><br>*****************************************************************<br><br>I believe I can show that the current audience score of 49% which RT displays for the Last Jedi is false. I can only speculate as to why they are lying but they clearly are. I did a statistical analysis of all of the audience reviews I was allowed to view. There are nearly 2000 pages of reviews and I was able to access 46 of them. This is a perfectly reasonable sample size which I believe represents an accurate reflection of the overall audience opinion. A five star rating system translated to a scale of 1 to 100 means that each star is worth 20 points. A half star is 10 points etc. Here are my results...<br><br>.5 stars - 339<br>1 star - 173<br>1.5 stars - 66<br>2 stars - 90<br>2.5 stars - 23<br>3 stars - 19<br>3.5 stars- 12<br>4 stars - 26<br>4.5 stars 25<br>5 stars 95<br><br>A sample size of 868 audience reviewers awarded a total of 23390 points for an average user score of 33.8594. Less than 34%. <br><br>I don't know why RT is lying to the public, but they are clearly preventing the audience score from falling below a certain level. If RT is protecting Disney's interests then this is a conflict of interest of the highest order and this site cannot be trusted. <br><br>*****************************************************************, 0.5,  Seth W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977051940/

 I've spent hours listening to critical reception and fan theories, and short of a miracle this movie could not have turned out better.

 My post on Rotten Tomatoes. I gave it one star out five. <br><br> Disney has found their greatest platform upon to stand and wave their banner of leftist, feminism rich, anti-everything masculine and anything to do with the true story of Star Wars. <br> Ryan Johnson is a yes man to the true villian of the galaxy in Kathleen Kennedy and was rewarded for his destruction of the franchise with a new trilogy for his loyalty and his deplorable script and nothing short of a parody that slaps Star Wars fans in the face. <br> Ryan Johnson you are no friend of Star Wars and no friend to the Star Wars fan base. It is clear and undeniable, in my opinion, that little Ryan was tasked with destroying the film, the story, potentially the franchise and did so with extreme predjudice. <br> The franchise is dead in the hands of Disney as far as I'm concerned. It would take two more films minimum written and directed by Gareth Edwards with no interference, rewrites, and reshoots to put this scattered story back together and put the WAR back into Star Wars and squeeze the story free of every last drop of the political venom that little Ryan and his momma (Kennedy) has had injected into and poisoned the story and soured the most dedicated fans., ni,  Daniel M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976986476/

 This is the film that killed Star Wars. Character destruction (Luke), poor character development (every major character).

 Honestly, I was so bored by the halfway point that I was hoping Kylo Ren would prevail and wipe out the rebellion. At no time did I feel the urgency of the rebel cause, mainly because the characters are so subdued. Even Leia was way understated. And, the CGI Emperor did not help the credibility of the story. Nothing like Vader's boss., ni,  Douglas L, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/975081523/
 A disjointed mess. A few interesting ideas which, much like the characters, are not allowed to develop or interact with one another and are ultimately frustrated. Moments that are laughable for the wrong reasons, and others very rightly infuriating. Adam Driver's Kylo Wren a surprising bright side. Otherwise, frequent repetitions of tired tropes, editing that leaves you weaving between incompatible tones and half-baked secondary storylines, and many many missed opportunities, 1.0,  Diego B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/912501216/
 This movie killed star wars for me. The goal here was not to tell a star wars story, but to push a leftist agenda down everyone's throat. Bad story telling, Bad character development and motivations. Visually beautiful, stunning. The art team done an incredible job, but all that is rendered meaningless when there is no meaning. I can't sit through the third one., 0.5,  Geo H, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977051234/
 Unfortunately for Rian Johnson - this review is not going to go the way he thinks it is. The Last Jedi is not only just the worst Star Wars movie in the franchise but it is just a bad movie in general. It comes across as a B-movie that whilst having great special effects, contains a storyline with no substance and dozens upon dozens of plot holes. There are literally hundreds of videos on YouTube that go through all these plot holes so I'm not going to rehash them here. Suffice it to say that this film spectacularly manages to not only destroy the course of its own trilogy but of those that came before it. It's a complete betrayal to Star Wars fans insulting both their intelligence and essentially disrespecting them on many levels. The Star Wars Xmas Special was better as at least it had a feel good factor. <br>I'm giving it a half star just because of Mark Hamill's performance (otherwise it would get zero) who despite the total evisceration of his character Luke Skywalker, played this altered ego with utter professionalism. I was genuinely excited when it was first announced that the late Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill would be reprising their roles but the way they have been depicted in this new trilogy has just been very disappointing. Disney said that each movie was to be a story about each of the OT characters - err no - it's a method to kill each one in turn whilst extracting cash from mislead audiences. "Let the past die, kill it if you have to" - well no actually that's such a dumb philosophy. Are blockbuster movie writers so weak nowadays that they can't interweave characterisation's and storylines with both new and old characters. Ask yourself - just why exactly do the original characters need to die? To make room for new ones and for the story to progress is nonsensical. I used to be so excited about hearing about new Star Wars movies (Rogue One was excellently done). Look where we are now - the whole of the resistance basically fits into the Millennium Falcon which according to Wookiepedia suggests a max capacity of about 16. In a galaxy of trillions of sentient beings, billions of planets and thousands of massive space armadas we're left with a resistance band who can fit into my front living room. Episode 8 tells us a story about one of most powerful Jedi that the galaxy has ever known bested by a girl with absolutely no training and then later on fades into nothing because he's depressed. A man who left a map for people to find him because he doesn't want to found. Really? This is the best you could come up with? I really don't see what there is to look forward to in Episode 9 and beyond., 0.5,  ItsATrap A, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977050503/

 This all falls at the feet of Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson. Rian Johnson is a joke. This shabby excuse for a story doesn't go anywhere. None of the characters were consequential and none of the stakes were real. NOTHING MATTERED in this film. TLJ was a nihilistic example of all glitz and glamor with zero substance. Rian Johnson in one foul swoop not only undermined The Force Awakens but literally delegitimized the most important protagonist of the original trilogy... LUKE SKYWALKER! What the hell were you people thinking allowing the hack who created "Looper" to make a Star Wars film? I'm done with Star Wars as long as Kathleen Kennedy is in charge. I refuse to see another film and I refuse to buy any more merchandise. You've ruined Star Wars. You BROKE a no brainer franchise!

 Personally, I needed a break with the usual Star Wars stories which can become repetitive. I enjoyed this film and thought Rian came with fresh ideas and huge potential. There has never been a more action packed Star Wars save for RoTS. TFA was an incredible film, however it was a rehash of the original which was its biggest flaw. Rian came to do something completely different and to open up Star Wars by combining old Star Wars characters and known places with new places and ledgends based material which is great to see being used. This film is being panned because it doesn't adhere to typical Star Wars, yet it would be being personally I'd give this a clear 4slated if it was a r same people. This film deserves far more credit than it has been given by the fans, I enjoyed it and hold it as one of my favourite in the series. I didn't think it was a good idea to bring back JJ for IX before I went to see TLJ but now I feel he is the right person to bro g in and complete his story. As he was the principle creator of the characters. I think when episode IX comes out people will appreciate this film more as it may make more sense to the people who just don't seem to get what Rian was going for, or the people who genuinely just didn't like it. But it doesn't deserve 49%. I'd say it deserves a clean 85% ., 4.0,  Don L, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977051192/
 Bad Writing, riddled with plot holes, dropped subplots from the force awakens. Took characters in directions that made no sense with other continuity in star wars cannon. Very busy movie with too many plot lines that tied together very poorly. Special effects were astounding and actors gave the best performances they could with the script as bad as it was. Two thumbs up to the special effects team and the acting staff. Lost opportunity overall. Shame., 0.5,  Nick S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/798755568/

 After reading comments claiming that people who didn't like TLJ are any number of negative names, I wanted to revise my review to answer these ridiculous ad hominem attacks before getting into the review itself. Our complaints are substantive and cannot be dismissed with name calling. Please read the many negative reviews that go into great detail, of which there are hundreds. You might like TLJ, but you can't reasonably deny it had major problems that could spoil the experience for many viewers, including myself. If you liked it, just tell everyone what you liked about it and leave it at that.<br><br>Like many others, I created a Rotten Tomatoes account just to rate TLJ. I'm not fussy when it comes to movies like this. I liked John Carter, The Force Awakens, and Rogue One despite their flaws. Rogue One grew on me as I watched it a couple of times on Blu-ray. The Force Awakens was derivative, but it was OK. It set up Episode 8 pretty well.<br><br>I start with 5 stars because Star Wars. Subtract one star for what they did to Luke and Yoda. Subtract one star because Rey is a Mary Sue. Subtract one star for the weak plot and generally poor writing. After thinking about it for a week after seeing TLJ. I'm also subtracting a one star for the blatant political messaging. That leaves 1 star. Many other reviews go into the details - no need to repeat them.<br><br>It's disappointing. We know Disney can make a decent Star Wars movie (TFA) and even a good one (Rogue One). With a $200 million budget, you'd think they could do better. Maybe JJ Abrams can salvage Episode 9, maybe not. Disney damaged the Star Wars IP with TLJ.<br><br>*** SPOILERS FOR EPISODE 9 ***<br><br>Mirror Scene. Rey's parents are "nobody". Title of Episode 2. Wink, wink.

 Last Jedi is a nihilistic, deconstructive postmodernist crap to deconstruct star wars! I say lets deconstruct Disney, starting with our wallets! Disney is truly the Empire, the dark side, and is pushing to lure us all into it! It tries to create a new morale (a corrupted one) by destroying everything u knew, u loved, u cherished, all moral codes, religion, tradition, burning ancient books, eradicating all you believe in and bringing and imposing their new believes, their new religion! Brain washing at its highest level! No effort is required anymore, no studying, no sacrifice, no work at all... everything should be given to us just because... we deserve everything just because... U can become the most powerful jedi in the universe by just closing ur yes, taking a deep breath... and thats it! A political travesty, a dystopia where there is no good and evil, and all your values are thrown to the recycle bin! Be very careful with this movie... is poison, dont expose ur children to this sjw communist postmodern orwellian dystopic garbage... and it killed Star Wars at its core and all that it once meant! Dont watch it, just download it if u have to! Disney.... Im done with u for good! "From now on, we are enemies!" (A.Salieri), 0.5,  Rodrigo d, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/866313079/

 My Humble Theories....<br><br>Well.... Where to begin - the 'fan'atical hatred for this episode, the questionable 4/5 star reviews, plot holes, lack of character development / arcs / jarring behaviour, coincidences, running time etc, etc, ETC <br>So much to choose from. it would seem.<br><br>A life long fan of the Original Trilogy (yes, afraid I'm one of those "I was there at the beginning, you don't know how good it was!" *Spaced Ref*), which I freely admit have some questionable moments, but seemingly not so many. <br>I've decided rather than regurgitate those much discussed elements to offer some theories as to the thinking behind these decisions.<br><br>Firstly I believe a 'new direction' was needed, many people complained The Force Awakens was a retread of Episode IV or a Star Wars Greatest Hits compilation, but The Last Jedi seems to have had no end of the same accusations as well, some of the people - some of the time.<br><br>Defying Expectations - As we now live in an interconnected world, where for the last 2 years virtually every conceivable idea has been debated over endlessly by 'The Fandom Menace'. It must be increasingly difficult for Writers &amp; Directors to make a film (especially a Star Wars film) that entertains, surprises and meets expectations. So perhaps being an almost impossible task, Rian Johnson decided to defy expectations, just look at his CV and style of filmmaking.<br><br>Mythology Verses Reality / Child verses Adult POV - while we'd prefer more logic and believability, these are after all fantasy films, so a suspension of disbelieve is required, which is easier for a 10 year old than, say a *cough* 40+ year old. Note-obviously I don't know the age spectrum of the disgruntled fans, so this is all theoretical.<br>As the characters have to face some hard truths, so too do the adult audience - heroes are not always immortal, people do change over time, not necessarily for the better and they do make mistakes which inevitably have repercussions.<br>Possibly Rian and Disney are trying to tell the old guard (people who were kids at the time of the Original Trilogy) it's time to move on....<br>These films are for children, that shouldn't mean OT fans are not considered as important by the corporation, but they are probably thinking of the long game.<br>Show Business is a money making endeavour primarily and it's doubtful Disney bought Star Wars because they were interested in furthering the storyline, completing the original character arcs or building the mythology.<br><br>The fact is this franchise has a built in audience spanning 40 years with an unquenchable curiosity, stratospheric expectations and an overwhelming desire to be entertained.<br><br>And I imagine shall continue for A Long Time To Go, In A Galaxy Far, Far Away...., 1.0,  arjay k, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977050971/

 First one was bad, a rerun, but hey, it was still Star Wars....this movie sucked. Too many deus ex machina moments, gutless rebels, all the males are useless, all the women are wise leaders...*spits* It's one thing to be politically correct--quite another to shove it down everyone's throats. Disney sucks, and it's bleeding through. 8.1 critics are shills because this movie was flat out bad.

 Most everything has been said. This movie was a big disappointment to me. I knew it would be bad when the way Chewie reunited with Luke was kicking in his door.

 [[Spoilers]] Having waited for such a long time, excited for the new Star Wars movie, I was, like most fans, completely immersed in fan theories, and giddy to see what they would do to develop the new characters, and how they would expand upon the old. Many fans wanted to see Luke in combat, or training Rey. Many fans wanted to see Snoke do something noteworthy. Many fans wanted to see a Star Wars movie, with it's massive, well told story arch, and a complex set of events that just so happen to allow the rebellion to live on in some form. What the fans received was a spit in the face. All fan theories, were outright ignored, which in itself is not a problem, until you count in the way they turned the movies instead of towards the theories, simply killing off certain characters who where the focus of majority of the theories. Other characters had their story lines destroyed, or otherwise negatively impacted. The only interesting thing to happen throughout the entire movie was at the very end, and even this display was not enough to use as the final scene for such an important character in the series as a send-off. The plot of this movie, was a disgrace. It was the plot of all prior Star Wars movies, compressed into one 2 hour film. Many of the event that created the story line were laughable. I mean, flying through space? Really? All of the ships being split in half when only one ship was hit? Why? And then you get the message that took place on the Casino Planet, which essentially told the viewer that Capitalism is a bad system, which only benefits "bad guys". The prior movie, The Force Awakens, was comparatively, an amazing story, and gave them so many setups, of which, they utilized none. The movie was a flop. The critics are biased. At the time of me writing this review, the rating is a stellar 49%. This movie has no bearing on what most fans want the Star Wars universe to look like. They destroyed Luke's character, changed the cannon on Force Ghosts, had characters make blatantly stupid decisions as plot armor. and ultimately, the ending was a deus ex machina. While Star Wars movies of the past have had a history of similar endings, those were always accomplished by the main character's use of the Force, and the light prevailing over the existing powers of the dark. This is the first Star Wars movie to have the end outcome of the rebellion surviving be caused by the absolutely stupidity of an Admiral seeing a ship moving to face towards his massive dreadnought, and simply declare that it's empty. The ship was clearly moving, and being piloted. To simply declare it empty, and ignore it, is ridiculous, and blatant plot armor used to allow the suicidal tendencies of the purple haired admiral of the rebellion to somehow save the day. This entire film, and I hate to say it, I really do, but this entire film was all just progressive propaganda. I don't want to believe it, but there is no other reason that explains half of the occurrences of the film. This is not what I want my Star Wars to look like. This is clearly not what the fans want their Star Wars to look like. I'd say that the highlight of this film was the love Arch between Finn, and that random Asian girl that showed up out of nowhere. The movie was, and is a flop, rating even worse than The Phantom Menace, despite being more modern, with a nearly unlimited budget. And look how that worked out., 0.5,  Jake G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977050950/
 Say New Hope in 1977 as a kid. Fan ever since. Was hopeful for Last Jedi but sadly disappointed. Counted over 20 major flaws that could have all been avoided while still accomplishing Disney's PC social commentary. Lazy writing and horrible plot development Hoping Solo is better with Ron Howard. No hope for SW9 as Kathlene and JJ are driving this bus., 0.5,  Tim%20 D, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977021630/
 Visually impressive as always, Rian Johnson's take on Star Wars is unique and refreshing! The character development of Rey and Ben Solo is particularly strong. Definitely some crazy twists I did not see coming. The action sequences are breathtaking, and are some of the best in Star Wars history! I cannot wait to see where the next movie takes us in this saga!!, 5.0,  Slade H, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977050956/
 This was a horribly written film. Terrible editing. Zero character arcs. Plot holes<br> you can drive a truck through. And this is just on its merits, or lack there of, as a film. Now let's address its place in the Star Wars cannon. <br><br>There is nothing resembling the spirit and myth is of the first six films in the most popular franchise in all of film history. Most especially the original trilogy. The social commentary throughout the film took priority over any semblance of character development. The tragedy is that there is no way to welcome this film into the series. It destroyed anything Abrams set up in ep 7. And it had an obligation to the series that Johnson just flippantly disregards. <br><br>There is no way I will ever see this movie again. I would recommend to anyone that they save their money. Do not support this trash. It's an insult to everything that came before it. And it's a shame., 0.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977050935/
 This movie was awful and I don't believe the score that the pros gave it. A 90% whilst the audience score is holding at 49%?? How can that be?<br><br>This movie was so disappointing in so many ways. If you want to take this movie franchise in a whole new direction, why not just write something totally different? You don't get to inherit this movie, its lore and characters and then shite on them.<br><br>I disliked the explanation of Rey's origins. I disliked what they did to Luke, character assassination comes to mind. I disliked Leia's role. I disliked the underused Captain Phasma. I disliked Yoda, he seemed slightly unhinged. <br><br>I hated the jokes, they were out of place in this movie. I hated Rose, she is a horribly annoying person who ruined any scene she was in. I hated Snoke's demise, that was a big letdown. I hated the flying Leia scene, this was so corny I laughed out loud.<br><br>I will not see this a second time in the cinema, or even at home. I am anxious (and not in a good way) about what they will ruin in the next episode. RIP Star Wars., 1.0,  Clarise E, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977050901/

 Concidering that this movie even gets beaten by mediocre Horror movies and geting harsh criticism in Aisa, for disrespecting the IQ of the viewers and having bad taste, in choice of actors...<br>(Not my words. Its what the Asian audience thinks.) <br>Well I saw the last episode and even rouge one. <br>I was disapointed by the "the farce awakens" weak writing, pointless plots and seriously rubbish design for Crybaby-Kaylo's "Saber". <br>Rouge 1 was a masterpiece of Fanfiction compared to both EP7 and 8<br>Fanfiction nontheless. <br>But still better than anything JJ could pull of since ITD.<br>You seriously think disrespecting Lukes heritage, making a "nobody" out of Rey, putting unknown actors in the places for the main characters and even disrespecting the lore (That disney themselve!!!) did create, with comicbooks and TV shows, would create a worthy sequell to the main storyline, after Return of the Jedi?<br>Wrong! <br>I don't care about the visually stunning special effects. <br>i need substance.<br>I need FANTASY when i watch Star Wars!<br>Bullshit is Bullshit and stays Bullshit even if, it is riddled with diamonds,shaped like modern art and covered with gold.

 This garbage has completely turned me off of any future Star Wars movies. I have zero investment in any characters that remain in this series and don't care what happens in the future with this franchise. Congrats to Rian and Kathleen, you turned something that you could count on Billions of $ for years to come into a series that will fall apart now that you have effectively eliminated roughly half of the fan base. Worst Star Wars movie ever, terrible story, what are supposed to be fan favorite characters now have no emotional connection to many fans any longer so I imagine a huge drop in ticket sales for Episode IX, I know who's money they won't be getting. I can't imagine how anyone likes this crap., 0.5,  Scott F, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/973668958/
 This whole story sucks! Every male character is ether a coward or a hot head . All female characters are hero's. I am not sexist but kinda weird. Also Luke Skywalker story is terrible. He is coward hiding. He did not want to be found but made a map within r2-d2. Stupid. Also the jokes are stupid. If I wanted to watch jokes with Star Wars I would watch Star Wars robot chicken. Not one light saber connected during this movie. That like watching a medevil movie and no swords hit. Also there are no auto pilot in Star Wars. Lady can't get on escape ship because she has to pilot the ship. Stupid! Also she did a Kamikaze into ship which pretty much wiped them all out. So now they will make ship with robots that will Kamikaze into ship!!stupid. Also the 1st order is chasing the resistance why the hell didn't they call in other ships to cut them off. The shop was supposedly going faster than the 1st order ship so why were they able to stay right behind the whole time. Stupid!!! Learned more about stupid rose than snoke. Luke has a light saber that Kylo and Rey broke but Kylo does not notice. Stupid!!! Luke goes it like bitch. And it only takes 3 lessons to be a Jedi. Terrible writing. I loved Star Wars my whole life but now it is dead it took Gearge Lucas 4 years to release a movie. So people say prequels suck but at lease they made sense this movie made no sensel!, 0.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976986450/
 The movie was ok. Just meh to me. The acting was good, visually great, Rey and Poe storylines were cool. But I felt disappointed when leaving the theater. The character 'Supreme Leader Snoke' was wasted. Such a great character but he is killed off like nothing and no answers to how he came to be in charge of the First Order, or how he formed a relationship with Ben Solo. No mention of The Knights of Ren. No explanation of what Rey saw in her force vision from episode 7. Actually no good explanations to many of the plot points from episode 7. Generally I like a saga to follow all the story points from one to the next. I dont like to be given cliff hangers, wait 2 years and then get nothing. That was very very disappointing. All that is bad and yet there is worse, this movie destroyed the heroic legacy of Luke Skywalker. The way he goes out is pathetic and cowardly. Rian Johnson made bad decision after bad decision with this movie and most of it's characters. MEH, wts,  Chris C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977050484/
 In short I found this to be a really boring movie, it felt way too long, it managed to make me not care about any of the new characters and so have no interest or investment in what happens to them. <br><br>The plot holes have been well-documented in other reviews and are so glaring as you watch the movie that they take you out of the moment and disengaged from the film. Although some people seem to have wasted considerable time trying to subsequently work out explanations for these plot holes, if they mean you don't enjoy the film whilst you are watching it, what is the point? <br><br>For some reason the ponderous chase plot unfortunately reminded me of the OJ police chase from 94' and just about as ridiculous. <br><br>Lot's been said about the juvenile casino side plot and I so I don't need to explain why I found myself constantly rolling my eyes and looking away from the screen often during this portion of the movie. <br><br>As has also often been noted, Rey is two-dimensional with no interesting back story/characteristics/development; I like Daisy Ridley as an actress - but what a god awful character for her to work with :( <br><br>I also hate what they did to Domnhall Gleeson in this, I felt so embarrassed for him; he is a way better actor then the dreadful comedic 'Hux' role. It actually made me sad to see him portrayed this way...<br><br>My overall impressions:<br>- The acting was good in places (especially Hamill) but the characters (especially Rey) were poorly written. Some of the dialogue was dreadful to the point of making me cringe.<br>- Visually, it generally looked good.<br>- Plot was absolutely dreadful, lazy and just made for a poor, poor experience for me at the cinema.<br>- Humor was more miss than hit and felt really out of place in this.<br><br>When a movie makes you want to walk out and you feel as though you have wasted both your time and money, how can I give it more than 1/2 a star?<br><br>As a side note, whilst I have read, understood and agree with many peoples criticisms of this movie I find a lot less information about why some people also seemed to like this film. Honestly the positive reviews I have read provide very little insights into the 'good' aspects of this movie but rather often seem concerned with insulting or bashing the people who genuinely did not enjoy this experience.<br><br>If you enjoyed this movie, great, I respect your opinion, please also return the favor to others who really, really did not., 0.5,  Johnaghhh A, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977032414/

 I am a huge fan of the original trilogy, absolutely cannot stomach the prequel trilogy, and immensely enjoyed both The Force Awakens and Rogue One. If you're of a similar mind, then you're in for a treat.<br><br>Some fans derided The Force Awakens for being too similar to A New Hope. While The Last Jedi has elements that will remind fans of The Empire Strikes Back, the movie follows its own path and introduces surprise twists that virtually insure that Episode IX will be unlike any of its predecessors.<br><br>Addendum: There have been many fan reviews giving this movie 1/2 star and calling it every name in the book. These ridiculously negative reviews are not in keeping with either the critics' reviews or the reviews of ANY Star Wars fans I know personally. Most of the really bad reviews seem to come from several camps:<br><br>(1) There are some fans out there who want ALL Star Wars films to be all about Luke, Han, and Leia, starring the original cast. I get it - we loved the original films and crave more, but their part in the story has already been told, and the torch has been passed on, just as it was (retroactively) passed between the prequels and the original trilogy. Sorry to say it, but Episodes VII-IX were NEVER going to be "all about the old gang", no matter WHO directed the films. If that's all you care to see, then fine - put Episodes IV-VI on auto-repeat.<br><br>(2) There are some extremists who are still butt-hurt that Disney scrapped the Expanded Universe, and so they will deem ANYTHING Disney does as "the worst film ever made". These people have no interest in posting honest reviews - they're basically pouting and throwing tantrums because they didn't get their way.<br><br>(3) Let us not forget the creatures known as Internet trolls, who exist to anonymously heap invective on anything they can. Plenty of those out there, many of whom are also in camp (2).<br><br>There are, I am certain, people out there who genuinely didn't like the movie for one reason or another, and that's fine: to each his own, as they say. For my part, I'll say this: I have thoroughly enjoyed A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, The Force Awakens, Star Wars: Rogue One and The Last Jedi and give them all grades from A- to A+. All had their flaws - none were perfect - but I enjoyed all of them immensely, unlike The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, or Revenge of the Sith, which I would grade D+, C- and B, respectively., 4.5,  George D, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/972649209/
 Wow.. how to totally screw up the new Star Wars Trilogy in one movie. Not only does the writer/director seem confused by his own narrative, but actively contradicts his message at the same time. Luke Skywalker is a complete and utter disappointment. And all the characters and relationships we love are hardly touched on, and they hardly interact through the entire movie. I would've loved to see more Chewbacca, Luke Skywalker, R2-D2 and old characters developing relationships and interacting with new characters. But we get none of that, instead our time is wasted, and the movie is dragged on by the silliest plot lines, and not only that, but the reveals are terrible. Not one thing happened, that revealed something interesting. A complete disappointment., 1.0,  Azoth S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/969548485/

 it didn't scare me enough then..<br><br>Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi<br><br>When Luke Skywalker says, "..Han was Han about it..", Rey smirks slightly for just a frame on the screen this shows that not only is the movie written explicitly on paper but also executed with all the dedication and excellence. The Last Jedi checks off each and every fantasy of a fan, whether it be complex concept, dreadful characters, awe-struck moments or one of the finest unpredictability natured script of Star Wars. The sense of urgency that was present in The Force Awakens is still kept alive with a tightly packed screenplay especially in the last hour of the movie (which is the ace in the hole and also reminds you of Inception) where the movie holds you on the edge of the seat proving you wrong about every prediction you might have created in your mind (Literally Luke Skywalker's dialogue comes alive, "This is not going to go the way you think!"). A marvelous background music by John Williams, stunning visuals and Adam Driver's presence on the screen are some of the bright colors that paints this stunning craft that Star Wars is. This is Rian Johnson, Star Wars and a cinema at its peak, without any doubt this is the best installment of Star Wars Series till date., 4.5,  Arth%20 J, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977050666/
 I am sorry about this movie, making Luke's character for this. This all with the student Kylo, and actually everything, it doesn't come through to me. I waited so long to see Luke again, and what I got... this teleporting nonsense. There is a martial art wisdom, a shaolin qoute, B.Lee says it in one of his movie: "A martial artist has to take responsibility for himself and accept the consequences of his own doing." I could write tons of words why I hate that movie. At least we have the Expanded Universe, where Luke is really a great force-user. The prequels had some weekness, yes, but I never felt disappointment, only by this Last Jedi nonsense. I hope in the next 2 years Disney is making the lessons needed to understand. Rouge One was great, tuching the Force through Donnie's character, but this now was the deep water, and Disney failed, to me, in that., 0.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977050672/

 They ruined Luke's character - he just wasn't Luke - period. Mark Hamill told them they were wrong and they should have listened. Rey was our best new character from the series and they've cheapened her story by leaving out any possible opportunity for character development in this movie. Instead they introduce Rose, the new Jar-Jar Binks, to take a trip back to prequel-land in Vegas and waste a half hour of another great new character's time. Meanwhile some lady from the Hunger Games is wasting the other half of the movie in a low-speed, super boring and pointless chase scene. JJ Abrams set this guy up so perfectly to make an awesome movie - so many cool new characters, interesting mysteries to be answered. All of that was either glossed over, left completely unaddressed, or resolved in some lame jokey way. In an interview with this director in Rolling Stone, he said when he got the job someone gave him a model Millenium Falcon. The first thing he did was threw it across the room to see if it would fly.

It will render childhood memories obsolete. <br><br>I saw it twice.<br><br>The first I walked out of there thinking, "do I hate this or love this?<br><br>Had to see it a second time, and said, "omg, I hate this movie" <br><br>I despise Arianna Johnson for what he did to my Star Wars. I hate Disney for what they did to my Star Wars. Was so pissed, I canceled my family trip to Disneyland. Going to Legoland instead. Kids not too pleased. Son understands. He was bored. <br><br>They need to bring George Lucas in and fix this! For the dvd release, PLEASE reshoot this movie. Save this thing!

 Utter shite. Nuff said on this disgrace, 1.0,  Paul G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/949397115/
 Infuriatingly bad. <br><br>This movie seems to be a vehicle for the director and the disney execs to push a political agenda while trampling everything that was interesting about star wars.<br><br>The plot dispenses with every thread created in the force awakens, and ignores the existence of previous films, established themes or characters, including the motivations and menace of the empire, first order the rebels and the key characters the franchise is built on.<br><br>Nice graphics, that's it.<br><br>The plot is willfully weak, no explanation or back story of key characters, those that get a little ie: luke, are treated with disdain, made into idiots or cowards, ignoring the entire premise of who these people are.<br><br>All the male characters are bumbling fools in this movie, and constantly told so by the female characters, who I think are supposed to be seen as strong but instead, can simply do everything for no reason and with no training, yet make super bad decisions with no goal in mind other than apparently teaching lessons to the stupid men?<br><br>There is no menace from the first order apart from a few seconds of snoke, who looks almost like he is going to grow into a real classic powerful villan, who seems almost like he is about to give us some insight into who he is, where he came from, why he is so powerful etc. . . .but no, then he is killed like he is nothing, without developing the story line at all.<br><br>The first order is more powerful than they were in the force awakens, why? no explanation. No setbacks from having lost starkiller base, they now reign apparently. we know this because the opening scroll tells us, not because it is demonstrated anywhere, no lived in universe, no time has passed to show us that they are in control and that there is a reason to fight them.<br><br>The force is treated as a mcguffin, it can do anything, anyone can use it, without training, to do whatever is needed. a joke <br><br>The Fin and Rose story arc is shockly contrived and poorly written, it removes all urgency as the characters dont seem to focus at all on the peril of their friends, but then again, heroism is bad in this film anyway, so maybe thats the point? They run off to casino world, and then spend a huge amount of time making political points on animal rights and rich people benefiting off poor people and so on.<br><br>other plot points ruin the universe and the premise of star wars in general, they weaponise hyperspace, now any ship can destroy an entire fleet, why exactly was the empire a threat, why would starkiller base or the death star be a significant threat?<br><br>This is a terrible movie for so many reasons, I could go on, but its depressing. Plot, Story, Characters we care about, struggle, real struggle to achieve power, reasons for wanting it, backstory, motivations, character consistency and development, this movie has none., 0.5,  Adrian F, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/797437020/
 How disappointing, did the writers even see a Star Wars movie? I thought it was maybe a generational thing but my kids were disappointed. Disney, when you buy the most iconic movie series in the history of film, you need to bring your A game, this is an F game.

 I guess I shouldn't be surprised that there are so many negative reviews on this site for The Last Jedi, Yesterday I saw it for the second time. I still think this is one of the best Star Wars movies ever. I saw episode 1 when it came out in 1977. It's hard to overstate the impact that movie made on films in general. It was so innovative, it set a new bar for flies, and ushered in the beginning of an era, where film makes could create movie out of anything they could imagine. It also had an allegory for the times, as the country was just emerging from the horror of Watergate and a President determined to ignore the law and constitution in a dictatorial manner. Fast forward 40 years and the technology has continued to evolve, but the story telling has improved immensely. No movie is likely to approach the impact of the first Star Wars. Before seeing the Last Jedi, my son and I binged watched every Star Wars films in chronological order of the story, including Rogue 1 between Episode 3 and 4. The Last Jedi really at two levels strikes off in a new direction. When Kylo Ren tells Rey, "Let the past die," Kylo Ren says. "Kill it, if you have to. That's the only way to become who you were meant to be." I think he is voice of the Director speaking to the fans of the past. Don't get me wrong, I love the past. I still think that Sean Connery was really the only great Bond. But I'm glad to see the franchise move in a new direction with new characters and story lines. They can't survive recycling the past. Luke had to die, as Ben and Yoda died. He passed in the same way, by disappearing and leaving his cloak. I'm also glad to see a new and much more diverse set of actors. John Boyega was terrific as Finn. Benicio Del Toro is wonderful as the code breaker, a combination of quick wit and conniving. So as Kylo Ren asks Rey to leave the past, he is the voice of the Director, asking fans of the franchise to do the same. I highly recommend this film. Just leave the past behind and you will enjoy as a step into the future., 5.0,  John S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/901007991/

 It is in some ways nearly unfathomable that a movie this good--one that plays with its predecessors' rhythms so joyfully and so effectively--barely outscores bored Tarantino garbage like Django Unchained, which does not. TLJ is not a perfect film and the postmodern irrelevant subplot will annoy traditionalists, but the thrill of the new and the graceful exit of the old (my lord--it is good to see Yoda back on his game after the CGI horrors of the prequels) makes TLJ a lasting artistic contribution to the franchise., 5.0,  Jedediah Z, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/954894884/
 Threw away every set up from "The Force Awakens" for no reason. Destroyed Luke as a character, pointless storyline and subplots. This will be the first time ever that I won't buy a Star Wars movie on DVD and I have the prequels., 0.5,  Bob S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977050255/
 After the disaster that was Rouge one and too a degree "The Force awakens" this is a definite improvement. This movie does not seem like it is rehash of the Empire Strikes back, which incidentally is still the best movie in the entire Star Wars franchise till date. They have taken the story in a different direction which is good. Yes it has many elements borrowed from the Empire Strikes back. For example Yoda decides it time to move on just like Luke Skywalker decides to move on in this movie. Yes there are some nonsense part too in the movie like Yoda and Luke Skywalker burning the remnants of the temple down and Princess Leia doing the death defying stunt. But all in all the movie is engrossing and definitely worth a watch. They do manage to tell a good story., wts,  Amardeep V, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977050224/
 Utterly disappointed.. I wasn't impressed with TFA to begin with because of its lack of originality (a new hope v2.0) but was excited to see TLJ. Rey is portrayed as a flawless character who doesn't need anyone's help. How to empathize for a character that gets everything right at the first attempt? I can't. I was thrilled that they introduced a lead female character in the new trilogy and I'm all in for gender equality but I don't think you can convey a positive message by bashing EVERY male character. Poe is hot headed and impulsive (needs to be slapped in the face by Leia to get his sh*t together), Finn became a coward in TLJ (??!!) and needs Rose to be guided on the right path again (had high hopes for Finn..), Hux was portrayed as a ridicule tool, the code breaker was no less but a traitor with no morals, Kylo Ren came across as a whiny kid, and Luke... ah Luke.. hopeful hero a long long time ago that turned into a pathetic, bitter old man. He would have been an alcoholic if that wasn't a Disney movie. On the contrary, all female characters are noble, righteous, brave, talented (Leia, Admiral Holdo, Rose, Rey). I hope this is enough subliminal messages for you. This is not Star wars anymore.. They should have called this movie the Gender wars. Kathleen Turner and Disney are trying too hard to shove their political agenda down our throats. Thanks but I'll pass on this.. The only positive outcome of this movie is that it makes the original trilogy (even with its flaws) looks epic and timeless. Star wars ended when Lucas sold the rights to Disney (to my great disappointment)., 0.5,  Fab J, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977050153/

 Disney has done a great job of completely dismantling what I consider the centerpiece of my childhood. Politically correct themes, unnecessary and out of place humor, the neutering of Luke Skywalker and the overall "Disneyfication" of the new Star Wars leaves me saddened, angry and desperately hoping a complete 180 degree shift will occur with the next movie lest my greatest cinematic love be forever lost and in absolute ruin., 0.5,  Michael S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977050242/
 This is the worst SW movie ever made. I saw it on Opening Night and it singlehandedly destroyed all of my SW hopes and dreams. I've been lost and wandering in a brave new world where the SW of the past that was spiritually big is gone. It has been replaced by something that looks like SW but is not SW. This is like if aliens saw a SW movie and decided to make their own version. They would put in all the trappings of SW, but not understand the essence of the universe or characters. <br><br>This film is an abomination and should be destroyed. I will never breathlessly wait with anticipation for a new SW movie again. I have sworn an oath to now read all the spoilers as soon as possible and let others waste t heir time and money on this drivel. Curse you Disney, Kathleen Kennedy, JJ Abrams, and, above all others, Rian Johnson, for ruining Star Wars., 0.5,  Bob S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977050235/

 Another attempt at a soft-reboot of the Original Trilogy by cannibalizing and recycling bits of The Empires Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. The scenes and plot were disjointed and confusing, the tone was all over the place, and the new characters remain as boring and uncharismatic as ever. The movie also seems to want to preach a particular type of feminist message in which the female characters can only be built up by tearing down and belittling the male characters. (As opposed to the feminism in the Original Trilogy where the female characters were shown to be the equals of the male characters fighting together with them side-by-side.) But the worst and most unforgivable aspect of this movie is the way in which they destroy the character and legacy of Luke Skywalker by turning him into a bitter, and failed old coward for no justifiable reason. This was an utterly cynical move to ruin a hero just to subvert fan expectations. As one commentator put it, this movie watches like a hate mail to Star Wars fans. After seeing where this trilogy is going, I have no interest in seeing any more of this disgraceful contempt the Disney creators are showing for a story and characters fans have kept alive in their hearts for over thirty years. You'd better believe that thirty years from now nobody is going to care about a garbage mess of a movie like The Last Jedi the way long-time fans still care about the originals., 1.0,  D W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977050178/
 Positives : Great visuals, CGI, and music.<br><br>Negatives : Everything else. What they did to Luke Skywalker is unforgivable. Glaring plot holes galore. A Mary Sue and a gang of other boring new characters are forced upon the audience while cheapening and then unceremoniously killing off the better written old characters. Inconsistent messaging(Are you suppose to sacrifice yourself to save your friends or not?). Untimely bad jokes that killed serious moods. Ask the director how gravity works in space, because I don't think he knows. Boring and useless arcs based upon intentional withholding information of people on the same side. Untrained Leia flies through space after surviving a missile strike. Nothing else needs to be said there. It was as if a group of Tumbler people, who have never seen star wars before, but have heard about it, wrote their own fan-fiction. The director could have just swiped any one of a thousand fan predictions and it would have gone been better. I am a huge star wars buff and I am not looking forward to the next decade of annually released Movies/Games being pumped out by Disney to keep resurrecting Star Wars, only to stab it in the heart again and again. There are so many plots in star wars legends that they could use. Make that, but with people. Shamlama couldn't do it with The Last Airbender and maybe Disney can't do it either. Yes I just brought it into the ball park of The Last Airbender movie. My expectations for the Disney Saga of Star Wars have hit the floor right now., 1.0,  Joe N, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/805934908/

 ***SOME SPOILERS*** Yes, there were a few things that I didn't really care for, but nothing about the movie that I just flat out hated. I loved the movie and the way things transpired through out the film, minus the whole Fin and Rose "mission" that completely failed and didn't make any sense towards the plot, but whatever the case, it did however give us an in on the final scene with the small child at the end of the film at least.

 This last installment of the franchise is a beautiful spectacle as far as crappy/pretentious movies go. It was really pretty to look at but nothing more. As far as storytelling goes this movie is utter garbage.<br><br>There are so many things wrong with this movie:<br>1. Building hype about Rey's history and who Rey's parents were then sucker punching the audience by reavealing it is nothing important.<br><br>2. Building up the Villain Supreme Leader Snoke (THE BIGGEST VILLAIN of this new trilogy) then killing him in the most pathetic anti-climactic way without answering who he was, where did he came from.<br><br>3. Making unnecessary side stories - Finn and Rose's side quest was pointless and added nothing to the progression of the main plot.<br><br>4. Dumbing down the character of Luke Skywalker the original hero of the franchise and making him go out in the lamest way possible.<br><br>I could list more but my main problem with the movie is how disrespectful it was to the long time fans of the franchise. What you did to Han Solo and now to Luke (and even admiral Ackbar who just returned to die in such a pitiful way) was a great shame. Add to that the contemptious undertones of the movie for the previous trilogies with lines like "Let the past die, Kill it if you have to" and how you handled Luke's role in this story (hyping the audience with that last scene from episode 7 and turning it into a slapstick moment then killing the guy off in an underwhelming unheroic way) is a big fucking middle finger that old fans really found offensive.<br><br>I wont watch the next movie, there is no "next one" The Last Jedi killed whatever love I might have had for the future installments of this franchise.<br><br>Good Job Kathleen Kenedy and Company., 0.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977023546/

 I'm not insightful enough to be a movie critic but here goes. Admiral Ackbar should've been the one in command after Leia (they should have killed her off, Kylo being the one to do it) and Finn should've sacrificed himself (his and Rose's kiss was forced and cringy). Ackbar should've been the one to have kamikazed into the ship. It would've been poignant and bittersweet because no one gives a fuck about this purple-hair-lady we were just introduced to half an hour before. Also, how can it be "reinventing Star Wars" when it's basically the same shit we've seen before: rebels running away from the empire, escaping to a planet (*cough* Hoth &amp; Endor anyone?), are found out but ultimately have a Pyrrhic victory.

 The Last Jedi was everything the Force Awakens was not - surprising, compelling, and daring. It may not have shattered the mold, but it did more to crack it open than any recent Star Wars film has done (with the possible exception of Rogue One). Luke's journey was poignant and fascinating - and yes, I'm saying that as an EU fan - and I was impressed with the challenges the film raised. This is exactly where the franchise needed to go - questioning what it's been built on, while still holding true to the foundation of "small, dedicated Resistance against insurmountable odds" that has always made Star Wars relatable. I love that it left me with a similar feeling to what Empire did, without being a carbon-copy of Empire's plot. I enjoyed the new characters, and I liked the challenges which were posed to the old ones (and the subsequent character growth which resulted). I feel that this film was more true to the EU in that sense than any Star Wars film since the original trilogy. Or maybe I'm just too much of a Revan fan. And with the EU in mind (or even just her family history alone), the controversial Leia scene made complete sense. Overall, while it still was not as well-made as the original trilogy, I was thoroughly impressed by how much I enjoyed TLJ and am fascinated to see where Rian Johnson goes with his new trilogy of SW films., 4.0,  Maggie C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/824566138/

 The cinematography is beautiful, but everything else is abysmal. The film feels like two separate movies, both of which suffer from poor tone and pacing.

Above all else, it disregards the Star Wars universe; everything that previous films and canon stories have built up, The Last Jedi has thrown away for the sake of surprise.

It would've been poignant and bittersweet because no one gives a fuck about this purple-hair-lady we were just introduced to half an hour before. Also, how can it be "reinventing Star Wars" when it's basically the same shit we've seen before: rebels running away from the empire, escaping to a planet (*cough* Hoth &amp; Endor anyone?), are found out but ultimately have a Pyrrhic victory. Ugh, so disappointed. This is what happens when you leave a bunch of SJW's in charge of the franchise., 0.5,  Xela F, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/912733272/

 Honours the old while showing us something new. People need to open their eyes, it's not Disney that is ruining Star Wars, it's the internet. Great movie with awesome visuals! Luke's arc is great and it is really the only story line for Luke that Rian Johnson could have done. Kylo Ren is the best character of the new trilogy.

 The Last Jedi was everything the Force Awakens was not - surprising, compelling, and daring. It may not have shattered the mold, but it did more to crack it open than any recent Star Wars film has done (with the possible exception of Rogue One). Luke's journey was poignant and fascinating - and yes, I'm saying that as an EU fan - and I was impressed with the challenges the film raised. This is exactly where the franchise needed to go - questioning what it's been built on, while still holding true to the foundation of "small, dedicated Resistance against insurmountable odds" that has always made Star Wars relatable. I love that it left me with a similar feeling to what Empire did, without being a carbon-copy of Empire's plot. I enjoyed the new characters, and I liked the challenges which were posed to the old ones (and the subsequent character growth which resulted). I feel that this film was more true to the EU in that sense than any Star Wars film since the original trilogy. Or maybe I'm just too much of a Revan fan. And with the EU in mind (or even just her family history alone), the controversial Leia scene made complete sense. Overall, while it still was not as well-made as the original trilogy, I was thoroughly impressed by how much I enjoyed TLJ and am fascinated to see where Rian Johnson goes with his new trilogy of SW films., 4.0,  Maggie C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/824566138/

 One of the worst star wars films. It waste so much time on plots that lead to no were. It disconnects from the previous movie since a new director who wrote his own movie with out a care what was laid out before it. <br>It's worth seeing since there are some cool scenes but man there are so many not needed jokes that it takes u out of the film and border lines corny aka now this is pod racing. The Last guarding makes an appearance. It also kills of old characters for no reason and takes a beloved character and turns him in to something u know he would never be come or do things u know he would never do., 2.0,  Jerry G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/841675445/

 I thoroughly enjoyed The Last Jedi. It was not what I wanted going in, but I loved what they did with the characters and story. The Force is not a function of only one family. Luke was damaged and broken, yet redeemed himself, as is fitting for this universe. Rey and Ren are two kids playing with powers they do not understand or know how to control. This movie sets up a great option for Episode IX, with the Resistance on the verge of collapse, but plenty of Force sensitives waiting in the wings. I'm curious and excited to see what Episode IX brings., 5.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977049884/
 This was one of the most efficiently directed Star wars movie after empire strikes back. The fresh portrayal of Luke Skywalker was interesting as it showed how he was in a dillemna. The movie was mainly on character development......Poe learns how to a good leader and take risky decisions while Finn learns that there is a group of people who take advantage of these wars for their own benefit.. the movie also shows what it is to be a rebel t-at sacrificing one's life for the greater good is necessary. Iconic scenes such as holdos light speed scene and the snokes room fight was awesome. Mainly the movie shows how the rebellion is struggling to bring Down the first order and how every character is learning from there failures to become better, even master Yoda pops up to lecture Luke...so in one word it was awwwwwwwesome!!, 5.0,  Agnivo M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977049871/

 To those who review this movie so poorly, you Star Wars heretics. Do not even bother to call yourself fans of the saga. You missed the point of the whole movie. You beckoned for a movie that was a copy and paste of Empire, you got it. This movie did take themes from ESB and ROJ, but flipped them on their head and gave you something new. Then, they took the Skywalker saber and broke it, intentionally. This is no longer the same story, from now, everything you knew or thought you knew is different, and that is wherein the beauty of the movie lies. The only markdown it receives from me is the forced (pun intended) jokes., 4.5,  Stephen C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977049874/
 Pros: Good visuals, OK score, unpredictable<br>Cons: Poor story, off pacing, repetitive, unlikable characters, inconsistent with lore of series, pointless sub-plots, huge plot holes<br>Side note: I felt like the new director used poor judgement inserting obvious moral lessons which felt forced and completely irrelevant to the story. Also could have been shortened by about 45 minutes, which would have made it much better. In addition, it felt like the director intentionally sabotaged the story-line and character development of the first movie out of pure spite.<br>Conclusion: My least favorite Star Wars, almost Christmas Special level. Wait for it on blue ray or on demand., 2.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977049831/

 Dont sip the kool aid on this one. All the praise is from paid critics, brand loyalty hacks who would pay for shit in a bucket if it had a star wars logo on it, or people who just dont understand star wars. The only good thing about this film is the cinematography, everything looks beautiful and incredibly realistic and yet all the immersion is ruined by just how terrible everything else is. Once you refuse to shut off your brain and see past the effects it becomes painfully obvious. The humor here is of thousandfold cringe compared to any attempts made in The Phantom Menace. The film is just that bad that it brings down not only itself but the sequel trilogy as a whole, and furthermore doesn't seem consistent with the larger star wars lore or any of the previous films. Jedi training is no longer required and a rookie can now best a master in a scuffle. Luke Skywalker has become so utterly unrecognizable as a character that even Mark Hamill had to express his distaste for this film and referred to his character instead as Jake Skywalker. Yes he retracted his comments, but this was only done at the bidding of his superiors. Some of the only things that stopped the previous film from being a tired rehash of the original 77 film were the interest of Snoke and Rey's origins. These points are discarded in the new film as if they were as expendable as a random stormtrooper. Subversion in this film exists only for the sake of subversion, just as everything in this trilogy only seems to exist for its own sake and serve no greater purpose, much unlike the cohesive epic told by the original 6 films. Say what you will about the prequels but they still told an important background to the events of the OT and the lore as a whole. TLJ seems to have been made by contrarian hacks that think they're so clever as they laugh and pat themselves on the back all the way to the bank with your hard earned cash. The makers of the film seem to have not watched any of the Star Wars films before the sequel trilogy and don't even seemed to have watched the Force Awakens, as this film seems disjointed to it. The new trilogy doesn't have that cohesive,planned feel of Lucas' vision and instead seems like they're just winging it as they go, resulting in what feels like a poor improv and the weakest yet of the 3 trilogies. Episode 9 is still yet to come out but I really dont see them making a comeback from this one.<br><br>"People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians, and if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society. The preservation of our cultural heritage may not seem to be as politically sensitive an issue as "when life begins" or "when it should be appropriately terminated," but it is important because it goes to the heart of what sets mankind apart. Creative expression is at the core of our humanness. Art is a distinctly human endeavor. We must have respect for it if we are to have any respect for the human race."-George Lucas<br><br>What has been done here feels like precisely that, the work of barbarians who seek nothing more than to exercise their power in destroying a cultural heritage loved the world over for many decades, all for the sake of profit. As a lifelong fan of Star Wars since that fateful life changing day 17 years ago when I was only 3 years old and first saw ANH, I never imagined I would live to see the day when the franchise has become such a poor mockery of itself. Perhaps it is just me, but the quote in the film about letting the past die even seems like a subtle jab done in extremely poor taste at those who would reject the new direction. The future is always ripe for the planting of a fresh direction, but for a tree to grow strong it must have strong roots as well. Without the roots, the tree will wither and die. Disney's discarding of the EU was one thing, but to turn Luke into a character unrecognizable compared to the OT, along with the futile attempt to rehash it, truly proved once and for all they dont respect the roots. People claim that with time this film will be seen in the same light as The Empire Strikes Back, you will all feel stupid years from now when the hype has died and the film is universally hated, and then you will hypocritically claim to have despised it all along. This move is not only an insult to fans, but also to Mark Hamill and especially Carrie Fisher who deserved a swansong more fitting for a Princess. An utter desecration and vandalization of star wars that feels like a hate letter to all who ever cared for it. I could go on about why this film is terrible but if what I've already said wont convince you then I dont know what will., 0.5,  Sith A, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977049626/
 Abysmally written, politically contrived, mean-spirited, with a spectacularly underwhelming turtle-snail chase for a plot; when it's not shamelessly swiping from 'Return of the Jedi' or 'Empire Strikes Back'. Another victim endemic of the virtue signaling rot peddled by (as contemporary and past history has attested) a hypocritical Hollywood. More concerned with appeasing a self-satisfied politically incestuous community of actors, directors and producers than actually crafting worthwhile entertainment. <br><br> This story, when not raping the original series, uses 'Star Wars' nostalgia like a condom in an orgy of ineffectual plot lines and ideology-driven tokenism that sends a flawed but promising new trilogy to its grave. <br><br> The story is completely striped of its spiritual dynamism (such as Yoda's "luminous beings are we" speech), its ruthless, morally-ambiguous characterizations (such as Han shooting Greedo, or Luke force choking Jaba's guards); and it's genuine sense of morality. In the original story, the Dark Side poses a palpable temptation for Luke; because in 'New Hope', Luke's motivations are based in vengeance for those he loves. In front of the smoldering bones of his aunt and uncle, Luke joins Obi-Wan's mission to go to Aldaran; and when his formative mentor, Obi-Wan, is murdered Luke joins the Rebellion's suicide mission on the Death Star. That capacity to hate those who endanger or destroy his loved ones could easily lead Luke down the path of darkness; and that aspect of Luke is the essence of his character progression. It's his drammatic question: will he become like Vader, like his Father? Rae, on the other hand, has NO such temptation (because, to start, she doesn't even HAVE a father); hence, 'The Last Jedi', which clearly mimes 'Empire' and 'Return's story structures, falls flat on its face. <br><br>Only ONE apprentice, the one cloaked in darkness, has any palpable conflict. Rae's moral conflict is merely burped by the script, to prop up any story progression. The first movie failed to establish her morality and, now, the series' is just assuming it. The story simply tells us the character's character, it doesn't demonstrate it. Because, see, that would be good story telling and we can't have a flawed female lead., ni,  cody r, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977049743/

 Like many, I have created an account just to review this and honestly this is more of a protest than a review. This movie is a tarnish on a legacy that has already endured the awful prequel trilogy. Star Wars is just a movie to some but to many of us, it represents much more. It is a world of imagination we were introduced to and fell in love with as children and learned to appreciate and cherish as adults. There are many glaring flaws with this movie, as there were in the prequels but what sets this apart is the treatment of the legendary hero Luke Skywalker. Luke deserved a much better ending than this and honestly I will never forgive Disney for this. The opportunity to give a beloved character and actor an epic send-off was squandered here for an edgy dark twist that was not interesting or in line with the Luke we know and love. Mark Hamill did his very best. I wish I could boycott Disney entirely but sadly they are the gatekeepers of much of mainstream creativity and these properties we've grown to love. I wish I could say I will boycott future Star Wars films too and I genuinely would encourage it, but I love this universe so much that I think other directors and writers deserve a chance to give it another go, but I can never support Rian Johnson again., 0.5,  Jesse B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/912737528/
 What... the... hell... was... THAT?!<br>I'm totally baffled. It felt more like a Star Wars PARODY than an actual film.<br>There was no sense of significance or importance to the story. <br>It felt like a TV episode... and a FILLER episode at that! <br>Ghastly waste of time, money and artistic talent., 1.0,  Caroline W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977049120/
 The list of criticism's for this film is endless... From the poorly written story, to the plot holes and more.<br>Watching well established characters such as Luke Skywalker who was known for trying so hard not to give up on his father, only to give up on his nephew Ben Solo all the way to Mary Sue style characters such as Rey who faces no hardships or flaws just made the film painful to watch.<br>The film is disappointing and I will not be returning to watch Episode 9 unless I can get to see it for free., 1.0,  Glyn D, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977049102/

 Sadly, Disney seemed more interested in giving us "socialy progressive" tropes than developing a good film. Horrible dialogue... destroying basic concepts of the Star Wars universe... comedic bits that felt cringy... plot holes big enough to drive trucks through... the list goes on and on. The best way to summarize it is with a statement my girlfriend made as we left the theater, "They arent making Star Wars movies anymore, theyre making Disney films with Star Wars names in them.", 2.5,  Josh B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977049087/
 Not interested...won't ever see it...even for free.<br><br>The simple reason that this movie rates so highly with...ahem..."professional" critics is that they agree with the movie's blatant SJW agenda. It's not so much Disney paid them off in $$$, but rather they were bribed with ideology.<br><br>Disney couldn't be happier with all the negative reviews because in their tiny minds, by creating anger &amp; controversy instead of politics-free intelligent entertainment, they truly believe it's the right strategy. So they're gonna double-down on that idiocy, ladies &amp; gentlemen. Because they believe they're smarter than you and they're not going to stop reminding you of that. Ever.<br><br>Also, to Disney/HOllywood, box-office receipts automatically equals implicit approval by the masses. Therefore, don't expect any improvement with Episode 9, 10...27; rather, it will literally be more of the same tired political tripe they never tire of doling out. Moreover, Hollywood is still throwing their colossal temper-tantrum over the 2016 Presidential Election. As such, those infantile &amp; puerile attitudes will continue to infest many more movies in the years to come.<br><br>And honestly, don't expect Jar Jar Abrams to 'save the day'. He is first &amp; foremost a coveted Elite Hollywood Liberal. And the Hollywood Elite is zealously obsessed with diversity of skin &amp; uniformity of thought. Thus the reasons for Finn, Rey and Rose: they satisfy the "Yay, Diversity!" quotient. They all have the agenda-approved skin color or gender. Therefore, Abrams, like Lucas, is far more obsessed in promoting his personal opinions than acting like a consumate professional &amp; providing entertainment free of present-day politics &amp; agendas. Given George Lucas's abominable ideas behind the prequels, I would never entertain watching another Star Wars movie directed/written by him. There are only two directors I can immediately think of with whom I would trust my $$$ to see a Star Wars movie: Christopher Nolan or Miguel Sapochnik.<br><br>And to paraphrase Ronald Reagan, I didn't leave Star Wars. Star Wars left me., ni,  John S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/941749039/
 Star Wars is sadly no longer set "a long time ago in a galaxy, far, far away".<br><br> It has been ripped apart by Disney and Rian Johnson's modernisation / Disneyfication that leaves the hollow ring of 21st century western culture and dialogue ringing throughout.<br><br> For all JJ Abrams unoriginality in TFA's he managed to be reverent to old and new and fuse the two elegantly together - like there was balance in the force. <br><br> I fear that balance has now been lost.<br><br> Critics have applauded the bold moves taken in this film- but I disagree that they are many really positive bold moves at all.<br><br> Can everyone remember everyone what Star Wars is/was ? (it doesn't matter if you are talking the originals, the prequels or the new films). It was somewhat larger than life, epic, a story of simple elements in conflict, sometimes dark , sometimes beautiful and wholly exciting - kids and adults yearned to live in that world -as it was fantasy and set apart. <br><br> This film was like seeing a film of "Star Wars trying to be like Guardians of The Galaxy , trying to be Star Wars" but with some quasi 21st century moral high ground thrown in....<br><br> There's nothing wrong with 21st century thinking I applaud it- but there are a million other films that integrate it and comedy elements less heavy handed-ly. Rian Johnson failed with this in my opinion.<br><br> It is therefore not bold to undermine the foundations of a much loved and well know saga with its own myth and legend and replace it with the common everyday way of doing things and nothing else -just cos one person feels like it.<br><br> This is again my overriding issue - Disney and the director have now made most of the heros and plot devices in star wars every day things- i'm all for inclusion for all and liberalist non-elitism (i'm a minority member myself) but it doesn't work well in a world of fantasy and epic other worldliness.<br><br> No wonder half the audience possibly despise it.<br><br> For me the dialogue and plot of neither the prequels nor the originals ever reminded me of living in the 70s , 80s or 90s or 00s.<br><br> This film reeked of today...! it stank of it.<br><br> Remember it's supposed to be in " a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away" !!!!!!!!!!! NOT TODAY.<br><br> I can see people shooting me down already- the reason it doesn't work is two fold:-<br><br> 1.) it has some of the most banal set of l storylines in Star Wars -and even they were handled terribly. The ideas of Star Wars were treated condescendingly and crassly by the director in his (to be applauded) attempt to modernise the saga.<br><br> In TLJ the trite explanation of 21st century vibes and attitudes to storytelling and film making is thrown in your face it distracts from the already non existent story....it's great to be progressive - but did it help the film be exciting? <br><br> Did you feel like you were in another galaxy? Was the space chase exciting for you? where did it actually take you as an audience member? Where was the space Gas station when you needed it? Did we actually need it to be like a Marvel or other Disney film just cos that's what all the other films out there are like now?<br><br> It was like Disney screamed "we've got to get all this all inclusive stuff in here no matter what". Shame as if these lessons weren't rammed in the audience's face it would ve come across nicely- then the Star Wars World would modernised- but not become obsessed with it suddenly.<br><br>Apart from the glorious visuals this was the worst and laziest writing in the world.<br><br>Adding diversity does not equal great film.<br><br>Great writing and storytelling makes films great.<br><br>End of.<br><br>Examples ..... Rose and Finn - middle of war , less than 12hrs to find a solution- only worth the carnage of Canto Bight- cos they let the animals free. <br><br> If they had let the animals free and Rose hadn't pointedly exclaimed " now it's worth it " that would've been cute, we 'd have got it... Instead it was puke worthy and rammed down your throat. <br><br> Admiral Holdo -saves everyone by a suicide run with a huge ship - that's fine yep Disney are cool with that - no ship left no Holdo left....<br><br> Then Finn tries to do suicide run 10mins later on a tiny ship to again (snore ) save the resistance- Disney not cool - cos someone he met 15 hrs ago (*Rose) decides it's wrong and says she loves him? whatever your view on this it's STUPID storytelling on face value in some way or another.<br><br> And the whole bombing run suicide run thing had been used twice already!<br><br> Yep Love is great and should win out - but in the middle of the battle field when you're all just about to die and you're fighting in a rebellion and love the greater good than yourself , saved by someone you hardly know and given a talk down?? (again- WTF? NOT THE RIGHT TIME!) Now Luke is dead too. Thanks Rose.<br><br> We only needed some crystal critters to escape after all that ( I roll my eyes)<br><br> Are the street children of Canto Bight going to sing Kum-By-Yah to the First Order and hope for the best in Episode 9?<br><br> I could honestly see Episode 9 turning into a musical if Disney were anymore obviously intrusive and Ren running an orphanage of street urchins who sing along to songs from Mary Poppins.<br><br> The plotlines only exist so the characters have something to do in this film - they don't actually really lead the characters anywhere important... <br><br> There's a hundred more other things in this film that are designed to get a rise out of you as an audience member. <br><br> A 5 year old could've imagined a better and less convoluted story.<br><br> Possible reason why some people are upset:- <br><br> It is a truth and a fact that Star wars has been at the pinnacle of popular sci fi / space operas since it exploded onto our screens. It is universal and is well loved.<br><br> TLJ was like trying to dress up someone of the wrong age in new trendy fashionable clothes and failing. It is possble to succeed- but It has to be done sensitively , it can feel right and great , but you really have to get it right. <br><br> Rian Johnson didn't and you know that- you're still having to think about why it didn t feel epic and grand like ALL The other films....<br><br> In a nutshell what Disney and Rian have done is make it a sanitised version of 21st century 'living'....with lots of hyperspace suicide run and fuel issues!<br><br> Ask yourself - is that what you want from a fantasy film set somewhere millions of galaxy's away? <br><br> So for those who do like it and say yes -that is what I want.<br><br> SWars is eventually going to be come tedious for you. It'll be like SWars Harry Potter but you don't even have to have a Hogwarts or magic training and everyone can have a Force Badge.... yippee! everyone happy - but less and less exciting. <br><br> They'll be more stories that are there just to allow certain set pieces to happen but nothing else- but go buy more merchandise and forget the rest,:- you'll be happy when you see people always doing what's right on 21st century earth : - ** Star Wars The First Jedisney " In a galaxy yesterday , near you"*<br><br> For those who say no - who don't like the new order :- <br><br> The Force is something you can now sweep the streets with, everyone talks like they are 20 somethings from middle class Californian families, everyone jokes like we do in the modern day. It is an all inclusive vision of star wars - (applause for Disney) -but it also undermines the very reason's why Star Wars works - it is too exemplary of our times and has removed the magic and 'special' powers that make Star Wars interesting as it is no longer pure escapism. <br><br> It is a badly constructed 21st century Disney franchise product forever more.<br><br><br>I can go and watch Star Trek for socio-political lessons with people stuck on spaceships with low fuel issues - but the genius of star wars was that you didn't have to worry about that, - you sensed its morals but not drowned in them - but most importantly you left this world behind and enjoyed the ride.<br><br> TLJ is full of contrived technicalities and twists to get a rise our of the audience and undermine one of the most universally loved sci fi worlds in history. <br><br> They do not serve the actors well, the characters well, the SW universe well or the audience. The SW universe Disney-fication will see future films become parallels of all other sci fi comedy and Disney films.<br><br> People say enjoy the film - it was fun and they've torn up the rule book too.<br><br> You have to write a good story to do that, that both young and old fans can believe in the transition.<br><br> I cannot remember watching ANY other SW film and thinking " this is going to date so badly"... cos it's so obviously of our time and Disney schlock ideas.<br><br> As audience members TLJ told us how what to do and how to feel about Star Wars and the choices it's character's made. That again is poor storytelling.<br><br> Be flippant about Luke, be sweet about the animals living on Canto Bight and their lot in life, include badly costumed Victorian street children looking bleary eyed at the stars - but make sure it has resounding purpose and emotion and feels naturally part of that wold and universe.<br><br> You also have to be able to suspend disbelief in any space opera/sci-fi/ fantasy film and everyone has their natural limit .<br><br> You have to believe what is happening would possibly occur in any reasonable shape or form (regardless of physics etc). <br><br> This film was non-sensical by half way through, the characters making unbelievable decisions at every turn.<br><br> Will the next film be called "Star Peace - The rise of the Jedisneys" ????<br><br> I do hope so - as all the people who loved the new vibe will be happy and this review will be wholly justified - (whether you liked TLJ or not!)Star wars - The Rise of The Jedisney! <br><br>Star Wars stripped of elegance, beauty and story..It all felt FORCED :-(, 0.5,  jon G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977049069/

 I'm not part of a Russian botnet, I am not an alt right troll, and I'm not part of some toxic conspiracy. I'm a lifelong Star Wars fan and I absolutely loathe this film. It makes a mockery of the story and canon from the first seven films of the canon. Every plot strand from The Force Awakens is either 1.)ignored entirely, or 2.)given a purposefully anti-climactic ... almost mocking ... resolution. <br><br>This film is just an absolute mess of plot holes, broken or unfulfilled narrative strands, and I don't like how it seems to purposefully ignore what Star Wars fans probably want to see. It drops traditions like bad habits and scolds us that we shouldn't want them in the first place. There is no lightsaber v. lightsaber battle in a numbered Star Wars film. Rey is just an idealized caricature at this point, and I can't identify or enjoy her story because she never struggles and is inexplicably wonderful and perfect at everything she does. If I was Mark Hamill I'd be devastated at what they'd done to Luke Skywalker. Luke is going to murder a sleeping child, the son of his sister and his best friend, a child sent to him for instruction and entrusted to his care, because the child is thinking bad thoughts? Are you serious? That's really a crucial plot point? Did none of the people working on this story or script ever actually watch a Star Wars movie? The resolution of this film is as stupid and anti-climactic as anything I've ever witnessed. <br><br>I have no idea where they go from here. There is nothing left except scorched earth, ruined plot possibilities, and an utter disdain for the Star Wars I-VII. <br><br>Oh, and one more thing: I do not need a morality/political lesson in my Star Wars films. Least of all, an anti-capitalistic message from Disney, of all companies. They found time for animal rights and war profiteering political messages in this film, but somehow I don't think Disney is going to talk about the evils of exploiting third world labor to make toys for rich westerners, bribing legislators to rob our public domain blind, or outsourcing tech jobs to foreign countries or abusing the H1B visa system., 0.5,  Michael B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/910426663/

 Overall, I loved it. Any scenes that involved Luke, Rey, and Kylo Ren quickly became my favorites. The casino side quest was the only low point, but it's nice to see Disney taking risks instead of always pandering to what the fanbase *thinks* should happen. If the Force Awakens was a treat for the original fans who felt cheated by the prequels, then The Last Jedi was the baton pass to the newer generation of fans, and honestly, I'm both excited and optimistic to see where the galaxy far, far away takes us from here. :), 5.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977048911/
 The only thing I was impressed by were most of the special effects.<br><br>Otherwise:<br><br>- Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy movie!!<br>- Made in a very lazy, lazy, lazy way!!!<br>- Excessive and countless plot holes<br>- Destroys all main characters from the original trilogy in an embarrassing way.<br>- Insulting to three generations of those fans, who really identified themselves with the great story told by SW.<br>- The new characters are not built properly. Now it is really hard to genuinely care about them.<br>- High content of politics regardind today's social justice, which IMO had no place in this particular movie.<br><br>I left the theatre very dissspointed and angry at the same time.

 Killing, rather than extending or paying off, intriguing setups from its predecessor, presenting one story-logic inconsistency or frivolous subplot after another, and, least forgivably, wastefully disposing of the most beloved film hero of this generation, "The Last Jedi" will come to be regarded as every bit the misstep as any of the prequel films--a case study in how not to write a story., 0.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977049543/

 Rian Johnson ret-conned what Lucas, Kasdan and Abrams gave us. The Force Awakens, generally very well-liked by fans, got a very big F-You in nearly every pivotal scene by Rian Johnson. And he can't write female characters.<br><br>There was a lot wrong with The Last Jedi. It came off as a montage of TV episodes. Of its too-many sub-plots, many were built up then led nowhere. There were heroes with illogical motivations and inexplicable plans and ideas. Perhaps worst of all, Rian Johnson writes his female characters two-dimensionally. Holdo, Rose, and Rey - all were wasted opportunities in this movie to show strong, capable female fighters and leaders. Instead, Holdo is written as an erratic, hyper-secretive shrew. Rose is written as a lovelorn fangirl desperate for affection. And Rey, ostensibly the protagonist of the entire gol-darn trilogy, got far less screen time than the real hero of the trilogy was due.

 This is not Star Wars. This is a Disney piece of shit. Thank you Disney for successfully turning the Star Wars franchise into a new Transformers franchise. Filled with dumb, cringe worthy, pathetic, un-funny one liners. There are so many things going on with so many different characters, everyone is screaming for air time, and the small amount they are given is lack lustre. There is no continuation from The Force Awakens and the plot takes you on an illogical roller coaster ride, jumping from one scene to another, just to leave the last one hanging by a thread full of unanswered questions. Too many scenes were unnecessary and the entire lore of the Star Wars universe is replaced with something I cannot even explain. It lets you down, and keeps you down in the dumps from start to finish. Different writer, different story. Don't expect a Star Wars film, expect a Disney fantasy., 0.5,  King K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/963500918/

 Legitimately questioned whether the film I was watching was actually The Last Jedi or if the cast had filmed an elaborate spoof.

I found myself laughing all the way through but not at the parts that were supposed to be funny, the humour in this film is cringey beyond belief.

Not a big Star-Wars nerd, but definitely not a Star Wars hater. I've thoroughly enjoyed a few of the movies in the past.<br><br>They throw a bunch of useless characters in (I assume for diversity's sake), and they expect us to actually care about the plight of these individuals. There is SO much going on, so much jibber-jabber, but at the end of the day, nothing is really happening. As you may have heard, Luke is almost like an entirely new character. I guess hes been jaded by his island isolation, but come on.... this is so stupid... he shares literally zero character traits with the Luke we knew from the original trilogy. <br><br>New Jedi Girl= Doo-doo butter<br><br>Her little friend from the first movie, Finn= Doo-Doo Butter<br><br>Old-Guy Luke= Doo-Doo Butter<br><br>Ghost Yoda= Doo-Doo Butter<br><br>Oh yeah, and one more thing. I know this is fantasy, and that we need to be using our imaginations, but when Leia started floating through space all frozen and what not... LOL. That was insanity.

 This movie is decent on its own but as a part of the Star Wars trilogy it doesn't fit kylo is even more whiny in this way more than anakin in the prequels Luke became a coward who saw that his nephew had a bad dream and tried to kill him but when his father who was darth Vader who killed most of the Jedi and children he still finds the good within him.Rey is as boring as ever who doesn't understand what a Mary Sue and claims it's sexist for some reason and tries to argue that Rey isn't a Mary Sue but lists everything a Mary Sue is stupid sub plot about how CGI horse things lives matter with the worst character since jar jar binks rose she does nothing to the plot and feels like a fanfiction insert more than a actual character. The way the first order was going to beat the resistance was by waiting for them to run out of gas. The movie has some great moments but is over shadowed by the bad ones. I'm glad Rian is trying to take reviews as a way to improve and not claiming people are not smart enough or are just sexist or racist.Hopefully he improves for the trilogy he is directing., 3.0,  Sam M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977048467/
 Oh my god, what did they do to Luke. Turned him into some grumpy old tit-milking weirdo.<br><br>The whole casino thing.

Not fighting what we hate, saving what we love." - that makes no sense and our cinema burst out laughing.<br><br>So many plot holes ..... who writes this crap.<br><br>The only reason I'll give it half a star was for some of the special effects which I thought were well done., 0.5,  Steve H, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977048462/

 The music, technology, sounds, and visuals were all spot-on top-notch as expected of a something with so big of a budget. This was not the Star Wars we know or grew up with. Poisoned by political agenda and an overall attempt to appeal to a niche audience who likely never cared for the franchise anyways, this film is an embarrassment. The character story arcs were lacking in any kind of poetry. This is probably the biggest budget fail of story telling I've ever seen. Shame on Rian Johnson not only for trying too hard to leave his mark on one of the most beloved stories in sci-fi, but also forgetting that Star Wars is at its core a space opera.

 Gaping plot holes, tonal differences and sharp contradictions in moral message and theme.

 This was a horrible movie, with a handful of visually pleasing scenes. As an adult male, the best part about this movie were the cute little penguin things and the disgruntled caretakers. That's it. I expected more from Luke coming back, but it was just a disappointment. Perhaps the best part of TFA was the teasing the return of Luke at the end. For so many men of my age, it would be like bringing back a part of their childhood. I'm sad to say, they never should have brought the character back. He, and Mark Hamill, deserve better than that. <br><br>Also, while trying to be "diverse" in casting/role development, Hollywood still remains mysteriously racist towards Asian males and keeps driving the whole agenda that Asian females are to be incorporated into their world in stereotypical roles. You can tell they purposely cast a throwaway Asian on the First Order ship just to cut between him and the first Asian sister who sacrificed herself to set off the bombs. I am sure not many noticed it because they aren't Asian, but on a rewatch, they had a very specific cut between their two faces, back to back. Horrible First Order Asian male; heroic Asian female rebel killed by male's actions. You don't really see any other Asian males until the Casino subplot, where another Asian male pops up as one of those "bad people" profiting off of selling weapons so they can gamble decadently. To be fair, there was one older Asian male in the background of a rebel meeting, and I do believe the other new SW movies did try to add some in the background. I did praise Rogue One's treatment of Asian males until I read that they were supposed to be homosexual, which is a another common treatment Hollywood has for them (see Captain Sulu). Also, Rose ended up the Julie to Ross (Finn) and Rachel (Rey), in what was a completely superfluous plot development. This was just an awful love triangle, and completely unnecessary. <br><br>Just like the "Diversity Oscars" a year or two ago, Hollywood doesn't care about being truly diverse or fair when it comes to race. They just care about what is popular at the time. So if Race X or Gender Y is popular now, and they fall into the trap of bombarding us with those casting choices, how is that different when the White Male was the most popular choice? It isn't. It's just a different decade, and a different trend., 1.0,  Blake G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/973359075/

 First lets start by just confirming I am no Bot, second how come the audience score has not dropped, there have been so many half star and 1 star reviews lately, but the the audience score has not budged, for the past 4 days!<br>Thirdly, I would like to point out that the very latest 4-5 star reviews seem to be very short, as though someone created an account, just to give a positive review, and they dont seem to say anything about the film... All very suspicious. To cap it all off, you have the critic, reviews who really should not be in their jobs, if they seem to think this monstrosity is any good. Money talks as they say.<br>Anyway back to the film, what can i say which hasnt been said. It just doesnt make any sense. You now have a main character who can go to toe with Luke Skywalker, even betters him, all without any training. You have irrelevant side quests and characters, the Casino and codebreaker plot, which you could remove from the film, and it would make a slight bit of difference. An irrelevant character, who no one cares about.. Rose.<br>Killed off the main villain, killed off Luke Skywalker. Leia should have died, but somehow can now survive after death, in space aswell may i add.<br>This trilogy is no trilogy, there is nothing to look forward to in episode 9. Rey has already beaten Kylo, has not had any setbacks in her journey, and is super powerful. There just isnt anything to look forward to.

 Star Wars is often seen as the shinning jewel in the sci-fi film genre. Sure the saga has had some missteps with the first, two films in the prequel trilogy. The Last Jedi, is truly the pinnacle terrible script writing and directing. Rian Johnson, has killed this franchise. His directing and writing skills have destroyed this film. The film is eye candy for sure. But it boils down to nothing less than a movie you can turn you brain off to watch. This is a terrible Star Wars film, but a mediocre action film you can turn your brain off too. I hope Disney do the right thing and get this god awful director away from this dying franchise., 1.5,  Harry L, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977048189/
 I watched it twice, because the first time I was in shock. Second time I wanted a refund. Utterly awful Star Wars film, I won't be adding this to my collection. Disney are now aiming this at a general audience for a quick profit, which is sad because I thought they actually cared about the 'product' so much for that. What's with Rian Johnson introducing drugs into Star Wars - Blue Milk? Luke tripping out? WTF., 0.5,  Lee D, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977048197/
 *Spoilers*<br>Other than the terrible "Holding for Hux" joke at the start of the film, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a cracking movie with more WTF moments than you would expect. And that's the point.<br>I can understand some people see this film and just think it's awful. I get it. It's nothing that any of us expected. It was a curve ball of the highest order.<br>I saw the first film in 1977 and that was it for me. Hooked. Complete fan boy for as long as I can remember. I care what happens to the characters.<br>Is it the Star Wars movie that I would have made. Nope. It's not. But what Rian Johnson has done is blasted the series wide open. Star Wars is no longer black and white. it's grey and unpredictable.<br>Luke Skywalker's path in the movie is just brilliant. I think one major point in the film is that Luke himself believes that (and he says as much) he cant just walk out and go at the First Order with his "lazer sword". As he pushes passed the regret he held in the movie he realises that in order to truly help, he must become "more powerful than you can possibly imagine". How? At the time of the Force Awakens, Luke is a myth. A story. An old one. By the end of the movie he is legend.<br>he is the guy who stood up to the First Order, took laser death to the face and stayed standing.<br>As the film ends you can see that inspiration played out with the little kids in Canto. Not only did luke save the few people left in the resistance but HE was the one that "Sowed the Seed" to inspire a generation to fight back. Genius.<br><br>Added to that, some folk has said about the whole Canto thing being throw away. This, for me was also a genius move. It showed that sometimes the good guys can get it wrong. They can fail. All that effort for nothing. It humanized them, made them more fallible.<br><br>So for me, yes, there was a little too much tongue in cheek humour in parts but the fact is, i did laugh. I did enjoy it.<br><br>But the best thing for us, the fans, is that Star Wars is no longer the predictable, albeit brilliant behemoth it once was. Change can be hard, but for me, it is essential if the series is to remain relevant.<br><br>Good luck JJ., wts,  Sean M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/797327380/
 Steals everything from the original trilogy. The Force Awakens (2015) was a brilliant revival to the series and set up the last Jedi amazingly with questions like who were Reys parents? and who was the supreme leader snoke?<br>In the last Jedi we find out Reys parents are junkers and snoke just dies. We also find that General Leia can LITERALLY SURVIVE IN SPACE. There are so many plotholes and dumb mistakes in this film that it is honestly not funny. HOW THE DUCK IS THERE GRAVITY IN SPACE RIAN JOHNSON YOU TRUCKING IDIOT. <br>Another irritating thing about what Rian Johnson has done with this film is ignore ALL THE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT in the original trilogy. Luke who spent episodes 4, 5 and 6 trying to REDEEM Darth Vader who literally killed countless innocent people would not simply try to KILL Kylo Ren just because he saw "the future" of his own student. Another thing which really annoys me about how Disney have handled the character of Luke is how they eventually killed him off. I'm not disappointed in the decision to kill Luke off (I even called that it should be done in Last Jedi) but the downright stupidity of the way they did it. Right before Luke stopped his Aberration against Kylo on the planet Crait, he says "see you around kid" then LITERALLY IN THE NEXT SHOT HE KEELS OVER AND DIES ON THE ISLAND FOR NO REASON AT ALL.<br><br>Those are just some of the things that are in the film which will have you begging for Jar Jar to return. Oh and I almost forgot, if you thought Rey never being trained in the Force before but nevertheless beating luke in a duel before was bonkers the ending scene of The Last Jedi shows a 4 year old slave boy SUMMONING A BROOM WITH THE FORCE. Yep there you have it, anyone can now be as powerful as Darth trucking Vader. Thanks Disney you absolute money whores., 0.5,  Joel W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976950720/

 Can't understand the critics +ve reviews. This movie is an incoherent mess. I understand that Disney is waving away the public criticism as bot driven hating. What a crock. Its a turkey (so I suppose its good that it arrived in time for Christmas). One can only hope that JJ (when he comes back to the franchise), can un-turkey the whole shebang. A tall order I think, but possibly do-able. I guess we can't have Kylo wake up in the shower like Booby Ewing, and realise the whole thing was a bad dream. The truth will be bourne out of how many people purchase the blu-rays/DVDs or rewatch via the streaming services. When those numbers come in... you'll know if it was as good as its being cracked up to be... but from where I'm sitting...

 Great cinematography which adds a story that allows the franchise the ability to move forward instead of clinging to the past. It goes in a direction that is totally unexpected and in turn provides one of the best additions to the saga. Poor reviews are due to people creating an image of what they expected from the film and when their expectations didn?t match the film they were upset.

 The biggest mistake is that they took away the optimistic Luke that we knew and loved and turned him into an old hermit who turns himself off from the force and the Jedi. <br>The biggest question is why would you hide yourself on the first planet of the Jedi to "die" then give complete directions to where you are camped out?!?

 Very disappointed! 1 Star. <br>I first watched star wars as a little boy in the early 80s and have loved it ever since! Dressing gowns and make shift lightsabers took me and my brother on many an adventure. I absolutely loved the original trilogy (and yes the prequels too) Darth Vader was truly scary villain and Luke the most valiant of hero's. He was an idol for me and many others growing up in those early days, when tv hero's actuelly made an impact on peoples lives and genuinely were role model's. So when episode 7 came around I was exited to see the saga I loved so much continue, it met pretty much all of my expectations with that unmistakable star wars feel, new interesting characters and pondering rich plot Lines. So after waiting now 2 years to find out where 7's literal cliffhanger would take us and to finally see my childhood hero now the fully developed and powerful Jedi Master he would undoubtably have become. Then episode 8 happened! and I've got to say it was bad, I mean really bad! JJ Abraham's had set up an amazing new villain in Snoke and a real keep you guessing back story in Rey both of which Ryan Johnson took absolutely nowhere! And gave absolutely nothing to the fans that had been eagerly anticipating the growth of these characters and their storylines! But what got me the most was what they did with Luke Skywalker?! I mean they must have wanted to Sabotage the character and his Legacy, because there's no way you would desecrate a well established and beloved character that way unless it was on purpose.<br>As for the main plot for me it was a completely stagnant and just a bit lazy.<br>Thanks for reading and may the force be with you.<br>#Notmyluke, 1.0,  Matt B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977046604/
 So it feels like there was some kind of burning platform moment during production. Things felt completely rushed and it was like "what do we do?" <br><br>Feels like hasty decisions were made. I think a "pause" would have been in order. Corporations frequently get themselves into trouble this way - driving towards a deadline and sacrificing quality along the way. I would have been completely fine if Disney, for one reason or another said "look, we want to get this right and are pushing back the date 6 months, 1 year, 2 years whatever." Kathleen has said this before - the need to get it right.<br><br>There are things that were good about the movie and things that were not so good. I completely understand that Disney needs to build a bridge to the newer generation. The problem here is that it seems like the younger generation was looked at in a vacuum. We are the parents of the newer generation, the ones "building the magic" at home for these movies, the ones taking them to the movies, the ones buying them presents and memorabilia for these movies. <br><br>I think this may have been missed. Now we have a situation where many parents have a bitter taste in their mouths and sure we will take the kids to the next one, but we are not going to help build the brand anymore. <br><br>Now Disney may respond "we don't need your help building a brand, we are doing just fine thank you." <br><br>Not true - brand building taps the deeper and emotionally levels of individuals. Think about it - how many of us still have the hair on the back of our neck stand up when Binary Sunset plays? That was not just the movies - it was everything, our parents discussing the movies with us, our parents setting up scenes and playing with us, playing the music in the background, the toys under the tree. <br><br>That is what many parents were building with their children through the Force Awakens. We were recreating that magical experience in our households (My daughter would stop what she was doing when Rey's Theme would play in our house). It was organic - not "forced".<br><br>I am sad for ourselves and our children - as after this many of us will view Star Wars as just another movie. And I am sad for Disney as well; hopefully this was not a future business school case study on how to kill a brand- time will tell., 1.5,  James C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976976777/

 What a shame. Rian Johnson was at least a competent writer/director and I had some hopes. But The Last Jedi has severe script issues, severe pacing issues that stem from the poor script, severe editing issues that stem from the poor script, severe character issues including lack of development of pertinent characters and introduction to unnecessary characters, all of which derive from the poor script. The directing was lackluster and failed to evoke any of the great cinematic language that we've seen and learned from over the last 90 years. There was no great camera composition, telling us important information through framing and movement. There was no powerful, unique editing. The reactions of some of the prominent characters upon seeing one another was like a TV soap opera; everything just felt poorly directed and poorly thought out. Many plot points took up valuable screen time and then were thrown away. In addition, this was pretty much a copy of Empire, which is ironic given the underlying theme this film seems to be preaching, which is "Leave the past; bury it, and move on."<br><br>As an experiment, consider the two stories of Empire: Luke goes to Dagobah to seek Yoda and be trained. Han &amp; Leia run from the Empire and develop a relationship. THAT'S IT. Tight, focused, easy. The characters we love have a boffo action-packed opening and part ways, then the business of the plot happen as both stories develop naturally, and then everything converges like magic to Cloud City, where everyone is almost reunited but beloved Han has been taken away. It's simple. It's effective. It works... because there's no filler, nonsense, pandering-to-China-box-office, painful Star-Trek-V-level-corny humor and undeveloped character motivations clogging up the works. Instead, we get plenty of screen time for us to see Luke develop and sow the seeds of both his doubt in himself and his loyalty to his cause. And we get to see plenty of screentime as Han &amp; Leia realize they don't just need each other, they NEED each other. And it's all due to Vadar's relentless pursuit. We all know the danger, we all know what's at stake. We need NO exposition, save for the opening crawl, and we're set. That's the sort of efficiency that a decent story can provide. You run with it and let your actors and your talented DP, composer and crew create the magic inside of it.<br><br>The Last Jedi has very, very little of this, and instead feels like a Verbinski-helmed Pirates Of The Carribean sequel: overbloated, overstocked, overwritten, over-everything. It needed four plotlines, three characters and forty minutes cut out of it. There is a seed of a good story in this movie. But it cannot be found amidst the riff raff., 1.0,  Peter Z, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/825995451/

 Awful. The worst of all the Star Wars movies...an that's saying something when you consider the prequels had Jar Jar Binks. This movie serves no purpose except to totally decimate everything that you loved about Star Wars since first seeing the opening crawl in 1977. This will be the first SW movie that I will see only once. The damage is done and unless they throw this 'episode" away and remove it from canon, I don't think it will ever get back on track.

 This film is a Hugh cluster of a director wanting to do his own thing, advancing social/political narratives over constructing a decent plot, and setting himself up for his own trilogy of films instead of focusing on the task at hand in making a great sequel to The Force Awakens.<br><br>Almost everything misses the mark in this film and it's place within the Star Wars lure/canon. Instead of writing out all of the problems with this film, I will list them as I'm sure you've seen this film and have an idea of what I'm talking about.<br><br>-Time: We're led to believe that this film takes place over a course of 12 or so hours while the First Order engages the Resistance in a OJ Simpsonesque - low speed chase. However multiple days pass while Rey is on the island with Luke. This film is supposed to pick up right after TFA. How is this possible?<br>- The unnecessary inclusion of Laura Dern's character. Who is she? Where did she come from? Star Wars is now relying on it's audience to read supplemental material instead of adding exposition in the film. This character in every way could have been played by Admiral Ackbar , a legendary character who deserved more than a briefly mentioned off screen death.<br><br>You know this movie is no good.

 Like the Star Wars prequels, "The Last Jedi" is an ill-conceived movie production lacking focus; a filter for its writing and directing; and competent editing. Being that "The Last Jedi" is the follow-up to the re-energizing "The Force Awakens," "The Last Jedi" is an extremely disappointing feature film. Whenever there is a bright moment in "The Last Jedi," the dialogue and directing choices always bring it back down to a sub-par level. "Revenge of the Sith" is a much stronger entry into the Star Wars universe, making "The Last Jedi" within the bottom three (3) as a live-action Star Wars entry. Furthermore, considering the dismantling of the beloved character that was Luke Skywalker, "The Last Jedi" is the most damaging to the Star Wars legacy and canon., 1.0,  Timothy S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/958152749/

There are no redeeming characters left, all the ones that survived have no substance. The reasons any of them exist as they are is laughable. Worst movie of all the Star Wars movies and I'm content saying that this movie is not canon, the Luke Skywalker that was in the first movies still lives there. Mark Hamil tried to warn us.

 SPOILERS!! This movie is laughably bad. Forced comedy (if you can call it that), pointless plot lines that accomplish nothing both in the movie and to further the plot, throw away characters and weak leading men and women (and whatever snoke is). This is sci-fi right? Not just fi? Why in Yoda's name are the shots in space ARCING?! If a ship can suicide with hyperdrive and take out huge swaths of the enemy, why is this the first time we've seen it? Since when, IN SPACE, does a "lighter" ship get to outrun a larger one? Engine size matters, as we saw clearly and correctly in A New Hope. Then there's the ridiculous bombers in the opening sequence. Forget the pointlessness of a bomber in SPACE relying on a gravity fed bomb chamber; if you can slowly fly your nearly defenseless bomber all the way to the weak point of the super huge bad guy ship, just shoot a freakin missile from far away and be done with it. How about Ren's squad taking out part of the Resistance ship with one shot while STAR DESTROYERS bombarding it have seemingly no effect. This is the whole movie. Terribly thought out everything. Luke and a brief R2 sighting are the only halfway decent parts and they are about 10 minutes of it. It's sad really because it could have been great. Forget the dazzle of the ship battles and chase scenes and other nonsense. Most of this movie should have been dedicated to Rey coming of age as a Jedi either alongside or in spite of Luke. She also should have turned a little dark. She should have been the one to kill Snoke and then tried to but failed to kill Ren. At least there would be something to her character then. Finn, Poe, Lea, Hux, and Snoke should have been bit parts bookending the real plot., 1.0,  ryan h, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977047915/
 The cinematic visuals are absolutely stunning. Other than that the movie was a pretty big let down. The quality of this trilogy is plummeting for each movie. star wars physics as well as regular physics are broken and in contradiction of previous movies in the series. the story is a lack of creative ideas and oddly similar to the Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. idk why they felt the need to have a PETA commercial in the middle of a time sensitive moment in the movie. zero character development or I should say Zero to jedi master during a time sensitive moment, no real training or time required. too many Disney "like" actors. creating "cool" and "Hardcore" characters then being easily defeated by children type characters. too many impossibly miraculous strokes of luck... like 20 times in a row! come on... need I say more... time and urgency means nothing. Politically charged. SJW agenda. OLED product placement. It is clear that their main priority was to generate profits (such as paying someone to write an original story and so on). I will not go to see the next movies that they make., 0.5,  nick p, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977047857/
 This is honestly one of my least favorite star wars movies. It just feels too slow and drawn out.

 Despite all the negative things about this movie... I personally find it phenomenal. When the original trilogy first came to be, people didn't know what to expect so we all happily took them in, whereas the backlash to this movie derives from "fans" not getting exactly what they wanted. For me, it felt like a genuine Star Wars movie, carrying unexpected, exhilarating turns and sequences worth watching 100 times., 5.0,  Keyvan A, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976941967/
 If not one of the worst movies I've ever watched, this is definitely the worst Star Wars. There's no mystery, no fear, no soul - it feels like a bunch of weird scenes just thrown together. The writing is immature, corny, confusing and boring. The villains aren't intimidating, the heroes aren't inspiring. It's shot and edited very strangely. There are too many moments which lack context, explanation or reason to mention. I'm no massive SW fan, but this movie missed the mark in so many ways I'm amazed it made it out of the editing room and onto the big screen., 0.5,  Luke H, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/917566417/

 This is not the Luke Skywalker I grew up with. Luke's actions in this movie are not true to the character. Also, my favorite new trilogy character, Po Dameron, acts like an irrational hothead throughout this movie. Only the female characters are allowed to act rationally or heroically. Leia flies through space like Mary Poppins. So many plot holes. This is the worst thing to happen to Star Wars since Jar Jar Binks., 1.0,  Nathan W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976014267/

 Sounds like the idiot director in charge of this abortion, used Star Wars as a vehicle for the same loathsome leftist social political crap that keeps getting shoved down our throats these days. No wonder critics love it and audiences hate it. That bogus 90% is just a monument to critics' pretentiousness. They will watch this movie with self-inspired teary eyes while penning their pointless, disingenuous, crap. Rey is just a vacuous Mary Sue anyway, and Kylo Ren is a joke so even apart from SJW politics it's not like this movie was ever really going to be good. Like many others I'll definitely be passing on this fetid sack of turds.<br><br>Also, lol@ at anyone falling for the random 5 star, one sentence reviews stating this movie is good and punctuated with exclamation points. That's just Disney's gorilla marketing being spammed by some third party they've hired to convince people this movie isn't pure crap.<br><br>Edit: Notice that 49% audience rating not going down even though there are noticeably more negative reviews than positive ones? Gee... I wonder what that's about. Gotta control that narrative right, RT?<br>Those trying to rob others of their voice by claiming negative reviews are fake are fascist hypocrites who've become they thing they claim to hate. <br><br>Fight back against this Orwellian garbage while we still can...<br>...And ffs Disney, fire Kathleen Kennedy already..., ni,  Scowly X, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976483286/
 Not a fan of what they did with Luke, having him give up and abandon his friends after kylo fell to the darkside didn't seem right when we have seen him go through other similar traumatic evens such has obiwans death, his aunt and uncle being burned and to a lesser extent the loss of his hand. Also not a fan of how they dropped plot points set up in TFA., 0.5,  Richard%20 G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977030828/
 What I had hoped to see from this new trilogy is a passing of the torch. However the approach I am witnessing is not a passing of the torch, rather an extinguishing (more like drowning) of the old rickety un-edgy torch and lighting some new edgier torch and calling it Star Wars. Wildly disappointed, I have no interest in Episode IX at all, I am done, I do not care one iota what J.J. tries to do. Any attempt at 'redemption' of the subversive plot choices of this film would come across as more contrived than the lazy subversive contrivances here. What's J.J. going to do? Bring Snoke back from the dead? There is no way you could do that that wouldn't be completely ridiculous. Likewise, you killed Luke, so please just leave him dead. Of course bring him back as a force ghost for an appearance if you want, but you've already destroyed his final appearance and influence in the universe 'in the flesh', so don't try to redeem that choice by doing something completely ludicrious with Luke from beyond (ala Yoda summoning lighting). Not that I care because I simply do not want to see Episode IX at all, I don't care. I'm just saying, if you tried to do those ridiculous things, it would not bring me back on account of said ridiculousness.<br><br>One more thing, I am pretty certain we were all to assume that Luke reached out to R2 at the end of "The Force Awakens" through the Force to allow him to complete the map and invite Rey to come to him. Any other explanation for R2 waking up then is extreme eye rolling deus ex machina / coincidence. And then comes TLJ, and tells us Luke has been cut off from the Force for ages, so it must be some other contrivance that awoke R2.....please.<br><br>I really liked Rian's work on Breaking Bad (where this subversive style fit much better) and Looper, but this feels like he just couldn't get out of his own rug-pulling way on this one. Pull a rug from under me once, it might be a genuinely thrilling cinematic surprise, pull every single rug in the house from under me, and I'm just left annoyed and insulted. <br><br>IMHO, 0.5,  Base C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/971648402/

 Starwars is a great movie. If you're a fan its incredible. If you're going in with high expectations that it will follow "the formula" of the other films then you will be probably lean more towards the critical side. I personally loved the movie. It does manage to subvert expectations constantly while adding humor and countless easter eggs. The film has it's flaws but nothing deserving the audience score on this website. If you trust that 49%, then you should probably take a look at power rangers (2017). I know the sample sizes are different but it sort of proves audiences who go into huge films like this have torches lit. While people who go into films without high expectations leave and give it 5 stars., 4.5,  Michael T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/823682217/
 This movie didn't take into consideration the events of the previous movie (TFA). Writing a movie before the last one is finished is a terrible idea, but worse, they don't know the whole arc of the series before it began. Rian Johnson went out of his way to buck every trend for all the wrong reasons. Tricking the audience with 'gotcha' moments leaves the audience less fulfilled. All Fantasy asks you to suspend your disbelieve, but once you break your own rules, the suspension of disbelief is halted. This is the least satisfying of all the SW movies and did almost nothing to advance the plot., 0.5,  Jeff S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977047814/

 As a long time star wars Fan i have never walked out of a star wars movie quite as disappointed as with this one! In my opinion WAY worse that the prequels! Feels like a bunch of nobodies playing star wars in a Disney theme park! Horrible desecration of the Star Wars name! I mean how do you destroy a character like Luke Sky-walker? Why can Rey suddenly not act? Why are Poe and Finn trying to one up each others cringe worthy attempts at humour? Where is snokes backstory?

 Good points: effects, visuals, music - normal for a Star Wars movie.<br><br>Bad points: plot, simplistic characterization - not unusual for a Star Wars movie.<br><br>More bad points: men are stupid, only plans crafted by women can succeed, white men are the evil empire, women and minorities are the rebels, everything that came before must be minimized and tarnished. There was too much underlying propaganda. It was noticeable throughout the entire film and repeatedly took me out of enjoying it. Mark Hamill's initial response was correct - what they did to Luke was inconsistent with what came before - he was another white male who had to be taken out of the way and made to look like a fool.<br><br>If you're going to shove a social agenda, at least be more subtle and have a decent plot to go with it.

 By far the best of the new 3 Star Wars movies under Disney. <br>Much better than The Force Awakens - more original, more creative, better acting/performances, better dialogue, and more emotional weight (yes, even compared that major death in The Force Awakens).<br>I can understand why it's divisive - every fan who thinks they're capable of writing a screenplay, had their own ideas of what to expect.

 Walking out of the cinema, I initially didn't think this movie too bad, I mean it had a few good scenes and was set in space. However, it didn't take long for me to realise how very bad this film was. It's all good and well making a film in space, but if you're going to exist within the Star Wars universe, then it needs to be consistent with past films. This film gladly discards all of that, and though it may (at best) provide for a cheap laugh, it carries no weight. This film has no substance. This film will suffer a worst fate than the prequels., 1.0,  Christopher S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/793397135/
 This is not going to go the way you think! Luke Skywalker couldn't have summed up this film better. The Last Jedi was a massive disappointment and is undoubtedly going to be controversial amongst die hard Star Wars fans. It fails to continue many of the plots and themes created by its predecessor The Force Awakens and even goes as far as to undo them. This is mixed with a disrespect for the original six films taking fan favourite characters and reducing them from noble heroes to broken and unrecognisable versions of themselves (In particular Luke Skywalker.) Kylo Ren says the words 'let the past die, Kill it if you have to' and this perfectly represents what Disney, Lucasfilm and Rian Johnson were clearly trying to achieve. They want to forge their own path and cement their own themes and plots. This would be ok if it wasn't for the fact that this film lack originality and copies vast amounts of Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi (from the walker assault on Krayt to Rey's training from an old Jedi in exile.) Many of Force Awakens problems continue to plague this new instalment. Rey is still overpowered, Kylo Ren is still a lost child having tantrums and the aforementioned issue of rehashing the original trilogy is still present. I chose to put these issues aside for the Force Awakens however it has become so apparent that it has made me rethink Force Awakens and practically destroyed my expectations for Episode IX. To say this film has ruined Star Wars for me would be an exaggeration but it has certainly made me sceptical of the future of the franchise., 1.5,  Michael T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/928167876/
 I thought Seven was bad just because it was a rehash.

 First Star Wars movie that actually left me feeling disappointed and bum. Jokes were out of place, pacing is off, lots of plot holes, missed opportunities, and plot twist just for the sake of plot twist without any payoff. For a sequel to the Force Awakens, this was horrible. Rian Johnson seems to only care about Rey and Kylo story and just decided to mess with everyone else.

 SPOILER ALERT! To continue the ridiculous character arcs from The Last Jedi, here are my expectations for Disney's, Star Wars Episode 9:<br><br>1. Low on food and supplies, the 9 remaining Rebels flee to Ahch-To to milk sea cows and catch Porgs for nourishment.<br>2. Luke, who DIDN'T really disappear into the Force (his mechanical hand didn't drop onto the meditation stone, did it!?), but rather created a Force Teleport, returns to Tatooine to live in Kenobi's old home. Luke disconnects from the Force for the last time and begins scaring Sandpeople away from lost droids who venture off into the wilderness.<br>3. Princess Leia, stricken with grief from the loss of Han and now her brother (or so she thinks), dies from a broken heart!!! However, we only get to READ about this in the title crawl for Episode 9! :'(<br>4. Kylo Ren, decides he can't live without Rey (Rey-LO!!!) since his Force Touch experience with her, throws Admiral Hux against a wall (again, again, again, again...) and deserts the First Order to search for Rey.<br>5. Admiral Hux, whose face has been badly scared and injured from Kylo's repeated attacks, creates a mask to hide his face, and takes over as the new Supreme Leader. His first major decision is to change the name from the First Order to the Best Order.<br>6. Finn, after trying to sacrifice his life to save the Resistance and finally bringing "meaning" to his life (his defining moment ruined when Rose crashes her pod into his), struggles with depression which makes him flee the Rebels via a "secret" escape pod on the Millennium Falcon (even Han and Chewy didn't know existed) and returns to the First Order, only to complete his stormtrooper training, and becomes the new Captain Phasma.<br>7. Rose, finally fixes the hyperdrive on the Falcon after all these years!<br>8. Chewbecca, rotisseries all the Porgs inside the Millennium Falcon and falls in love with Rose.<br>9. Rey, returns to Jakku to read the mind of Unkar Platt, and begins her journey in search for her drunk parents' grave.<br>10. Poe Dameron keeps blowing things up!<br>11. Admiral Ackbar, who doesn't breathe oxygen, realizes he TOO can use the Force, contacts Princess Leia to come and pick him up on their way to Ach-To.<br>12. The young force sensitive boy on Canto, leads a rebellion with more force sensitive kids against their captors to fight for better hourly wages while working with the Fathiers! They also fight for more rest for the Fathiers, so the animals don't have to run BACK-To-BACK races after returning from recent planet voyages.<br>13. The "old"Captain Phasma is DEAD for GOOD, so we don't have to see any more lame fights!<br>14. Supreme Leader Snoke, isn't really dead! He was just using a really good puppet and will return for Episode 9 to reclaim his Empire!<br>15. DJ, after becoming a multi-millionaire from turning Finn and Rose over to the First Order, returns to Canto Bight to begin building a better, and I mean a BETTER, and BIGGEST, and I mean really BIG, new Death Star to bring peace and happiness to the Galaxy!, 2.0,  Tommy A, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977047024/
 I love anything starwars, and I loved this, but I have to give it a poor review, because of some stupid plot points. Two huge battle ships out of range from each other for the whole movie, but key characters can whisk in and out when they want too. You could have just put them on a planet with shield and wasted the same time. . Oh that would be another movie..... The force, which all of a sudden included 'free' training. hyperspace, that can destroy a flotilla of ships (not to mention get let you fly in and under a planet wide shield). Next time, read the script to a bunch of people and if some of them go 'but how did they.....' then listen. This film stinks of set pieced with the story made up after.

 Honestly it just wasn't good. Out of the whole movie their were only 4 parts I liked, and even those scenes are divisive among fans. The rest of the movie is garbage.

 The Last Jedi is the worst Star Wars movie of the complete Saga. This script betrayed the original characters. This movie failed to answer the questions from the previous movie. The story failed to follow the conventions set up in the previous Star Wars films. The new characters were one dimensional and their archs went nowhere.

 Terrible movie with terrific CGI. Felt like they only cared about making money and not making a quality film. The film lacked common sense and had so many plot holes. They also blew off so many chances for character development and creativity. I tried to logically like it, but I couldn't.

 loved it...amazing movie! Go see it!, 5.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976925507/
 This movie is decent on its own but as a part of the Star Wars trilogy it doesn't fit kylo is even more whiny in this way more than anakin in the prequels Luke became a coward who saw that his nephew had a bad dream and tried to kill him but when his father who was darth Vader who killed most of the Jedi and children he still finds the good within him.Rey is as boring as ever who doesn't understand what a Mary Sue and claims it's sexist for some reason and tries to argue that Rey isn't a Mary Sue but lists everything a Mary Sue is stupid sub plot about how CGI horse things lives matter with the worst character since jar jar binks rose she does nothing to the plot and feels like a fanfiction insert more than a actual character. The way the first order was going to beat the resistance was by waiting for them to run out of gas. The movie has some great moments but is over shadowed by the bad ones. I'm glad Rian is trying to take reviews as a way to improve and not claiming people are not smart enough or are just sexist or racist.Hopefully he improves for the trilogy he is directing., 3.0,  Sam M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977048467/
 Oh my god, what did they do to Luke. Turned him into some grumpy old tit-milking weirdo.<br><br>The whole casino thing. How can Disney a multi-billion dollar organisation spend half a film on lecturing the public on why making money is bad.<br><br>They even put a purple haired feminist in just to fill the diversity quota...talk about projecting your insecurities.<br><br>Poor Finn, was the janitor of the Death Star now he's just looking for a plot arc and when he gets to finally get to do something and sacrifice himself for his fellow rebels...another diversity hire Rose stops him from having a big send off and mutters these immortal words "that's how we're gonna win. Not fighting what we hate, saving what we love." - that makes no sense and our cinema burst out laughing.<br><br>So many plot holes ..... who writes this crap.<br><br>The only reason I'll give it half a star was for some of the special effects which I thought were well done., 0.5,  Steve H, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977048462/

 While watching the movie I felt that the magic was lost. Lovable characters like Luke and Lea becoming old and petty that you just feel they should be put out of their misery, even C-3PO becoming a shadow of his brilliant self. The new characters are just not empathy inspiring perhaps John Boyega's Finn is the closest but definitely getting lost through the plot. Watching the last 30 minutes of the film was pure torture feeling like it's too much too little. At least by "joining the force" the old &amp; petty Luke Skywalker is saving face from appearing in the next sequel., 2.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977048437/
 The Last Jedi - More like the last Star Wars movie I'll see on the big screen. After waiting so long for this, I felt after watching it I'd been hoodwinked. I felt betrayed, my childhood raped. Rian completely ruined Star Wars for many fans. He completely ignored everything J.J. setup in TFA, and took a big steaming dump on it, whilst giving us original fans the middle finger. Sure, as Lucas said, it was beautifully made, but the incoherent plot, pointless characters, Mary Poppins Leia and the complete mishandling of Lukes legacy , makes me wish I never saw this, whatever you can call it. I urge any diehard Star Wars fan to avoid this flick, and preserve the fond memories of the original 6. Such a shame, there were so many missed opportunities. Rian you had so much to work with.

 Awesome to see that Rian Johnson took some risks with The Last Jedi. He created a film full of surprises and expanded the possibilities of the Star Wars lore, especially how he displays the force throughout the film.

 Been thinking abit about new Starwars movie the last jedi. As a big Starwars fan and I had high hopes. I watched it over Christmas and after seeing felt unsure how I felt but kind of disappointed. The more I think about it the more I dislike it. I really dislike the direction they took with Luke, just doesn't make sense, now a coward a complete opposite to the ultimate hero like that in original triology. He really adds little to the story and might as well not be in it. Unfunny jokes, strange and boring slow chase space battle. Rey character seems go no where and has no challenges to overcome, makes no mistakes and doesn't grow in character so she seems unrealistic. Rey's parent plot goes nowhere. Stupid Yoda scene, where a force ghost can cause lightning. Unsatisfying plot for Snoke, he just dies too easily.<br>Pointless Walker scene with silly slow moving big cannon, why wouldn't they land closer...<br>Why are the first order so dumb, with stupid men, no women, expect Phasma who story is wasted again.<br>Where are the bounty hunters and interesting evil aliens.<br>Ehhh. It just doesn't make any sense, or tie in properly with the other movies.<br>So disappointing and unsatisfying.<br>What's good about it, definitely visually pleasing, and sounds good., 0.5,  Phil M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977048367/
 Although I'm not sure it works as part of the Star Wars Saga films as it feels small and self contained with a sense of finality, it is an excellent film set in the Star Wars universe, episode 9 will end up defining this movie, I can't help but feel JJ Abrams must be a little disappointed with what happened with his set up in episode 7 and it'll be interesting how he will pick up the story.

 watched it together with my gf which is not a SW fan and therefore gave an unbiased opinion. She found it very boring, to the point she started looking at her phone after one hour. My opinion as a SW fan is even worse... it's a petty such a good cast of actors were given such a terrible script. Apart from being boring, the plot is stupid to say the least even for a 5-y old approaching the series for the first time. If Disney is so sure that killing all of the old characters gives the series a fresh start, why don't they apply the same thinking to their original characters and chop Mickey Mouse's head off? :), 0.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977048319/

 The film was visually impressive and the music was was very well done. However the music and the visual spectacles cannot redeem this film's plot. There were several holes in the plot, which I intend to discuss concisely.<br>1. C 3PO no longer has a red arm like he did in TFA.<br>2. The First Order conquered the galaxy in a few hours.<br>3. Rey received very little training from Luke and fought off several Praetorian Guards.<br>4. The First Order ships didn't light speed their way closer to the Resistance ships that were running out of fuel.<br>5. Vice Admiral Holdo refused to tell Poe her plans without cause which lead to a mutiny.<br>6. Leia is shown to be a powerful force user without any explanation.<br>7. Finn somehow beat Captain Phasma in a duel.<br>8. Kylo Ren was able to kill Snoke without Snoke sensing anything.<br>9. Kylo decided to destroy the Resistance without an explanation after he killed Snoke.<br>These are just a few of the many glaring plot holes in the story. Another gripe I have with the film is that Luke Skywalker is totally out of character without any good explanations. There was also a great deal of misplaced and quite cringy humour in the film. The film seemed to go out of its way to completely ruin mysteries from the TFA with unsatisfying answers or no answers. There were also several moments in the film where political agendas were obviously being pushed in annoying and obnoxious ways. There was incredibly little development of any of the new characters from TFA. While I am not a serious Star Wars fan I do watch the films quite often and this one feels totally out of place and weird. I don't know what Disney execs thought was so amazing about it and I don't particularly care, because I don't have to watch this film ever again., 2.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977047237/

 I don't want to flesh this review out as I will be required to feel. And i feel sad this script got green lit. I'll do my best to ignore this in the grand Skywalker saga and perhaps fill in the black hole with my own imaginings over time.

 This movie was so bad that I'm having trouble knowing where to start. <br><br>First, let me say this; I get the idea that Disney wants to take the franchise in a different direction, and that this trilogy is supposed to be that transition.<br><br>BUT even in science fiction, characters have to behave in a believable way if order for you to care about them. What this movie does is throw out 40 years of established concepts about how these characters operate, what they believe, and how they would react in certain situations. It would be like if they made a sequel to Bambi and you find out that grown up Bambi is up on assault charges and his girl friend is now a stripper. Hey- we're taking it in a new direction, right?<br><br>The plot is simplistic, the new characters unremarkable and superficial. Plus, it either minimized or straight up ignored all of the plot points that were left hanging in the previous movie. Watching this was like watching Sharknado, if Sharknado had been made with a hundred million dollar special effects budget.<br><br>Disney may have made a billion dollars with this thing, but as far as I'm concerned, they've also killed their golden goose. Walking out of the theater afterward was like leaving a disaster site. people were just kind of numb, like they couldn't believe what they had just seen. Since then, I haven't talked to a single person over 35 who liked it. As for me, I have zero interest in seeing the next one, and if Rotten Tomatoes is anywhere near accurate, I'm not the only one who holds that opinion.<br><br>Disney may say publicly that they are thrilled with the direction the franchise is going, that the buzz is good, whatever. But in my industry, if a product got less than a 50% satisfaction rating, it would be scrapped or overhauled faster than the Millennium Falcon could make the Kessell run and the people responsible would be looking for a new job.<br><br>R.I.P. Star Wars., 0.5,  Terry S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977047103/
 The most Poorly written, directed and produced film in the Star Wars saga by far. The prequels felt more like Star Wars than the last Jedi did. During the film I was saying to myself this can't be right nothing feels like it should. I saw the force awakens twice in theaters and the last Jedi I won't even buy the blue ray it's that bad. No more of my money for you I say to the people who let this come to the big screen be smart Disney and hire a film student in college and you'll have a better Star Wars movie. P. S no more politics in movies unless it's a movie about politics please people hate seeing it in film., 0.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977047194/
 I left the theater on the night I saw Star Wars The Last Jedi thinking that it wasn't a bad movie. It wasn't great. But it wasn't awful. At the same time I left feeling bothered. A kind of itch in the back of my sensibility. Something I couldn't put my finger on. I thought about it all night and into the next day. So I decided I would write out the plot on paper to get out everything i still had in my memory bank. As I wrote I began to see more and more clearly the reasons why I felt the way I did. <br><br>I felt this way after the first 10 minutes of Aliens 3. I loved Alien and Aliens. Ripley had taken us on a compelling and exciting journey and we left feeling satisfied. I loved the characters that were left at the end of part 2. And then at the beginning of part 3, the writers kill off every beloved character and impregnate Ripley with an alien so she could die in the way she feared most. This is what The Last Jedi felt like. <br><br>I wont get into the caricatures they made of every character or the plot holes or the story inconsistencies. But they all exist. and I understand. I think i know why. I think we are at a unique point in history. We need more movies where all the women are heroes and martyrs and powerful. And we need more movies where men are shown to be men. reckless and angry and wishy washy and cowardly and power hungry and animal abusers and bullies. I believe there are ways to convey all of this. I think they tried but failed. <br><br>I will say that it was alot of fun to see visually. It was gorgeously shot. There were a few very creative ways they expanded the mythology and universe that i really appreciated. The action sequences were riveting. The lightsaber fights were amazing. So I will give it half a star for that. But I wish it was a different movie. I would say go see it and if you leave thinking it wasn't bad but it wasn't great, leave it there and don't overthink it., 0.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977047120/

 TLJ would've been better served as a cartoon movie or some type standalone story. It didn't deserve to be an installment in the saga and did nothing to advance the story. 60-70% of this movie could've been covered in a few sentences of the opening crawl in a better Star Wars movie. <br><br>It seemed so disjointed from TFA and just threw out all the intrigue from that movie and made it meaningless. I think Rian Johnson tried to make the movie unpredictable instead of good. And top it all off, he ruined Luke's character and didn't really given an explanation of how he became that way.

 Hi!!!<br><br>I never made an account here before, but I did because it is disgusting what Americans are doing to a work of art. As a South American man I am not familiar with Social Justice warrior agendas or feminist political themes, it is not existent where I am from, so for you Americans to put that crap inside the movie and not even attempt to place it there subtly was an insult. Latin Americans dont care about your partisan politics, we want to see a good movie, a work of art, and the feminist men hating Kathleen Kennedy and her Beta male social justice warrior self loathing white man Rian Johnson destroyed a work of art. You know who else destroys works of art? ISIS, you people are no better than ISIS, a bunch of privileged culture destroyers. Funny how you add anti-capitalist elements in the film when you people profit from capitalism, Disney is the epitome of capitalism yet they try everything to destroy it. It is an absolute epitome of mental illness. <br><br>Everybody hates these movies, blacks, whites, Mestizos, Indians, Chinese, they all have the same feelings I have, you destroyed the Star wars Lore, you destroyed the essence of Star wars, stop assuming only white males hated it, I am not white, and I despised it just like many other non-white males. Even females hated it. Stop destroying a cultural medium of unity, Star Wars brings all of us together, to have our minds traverse a galaxy far far away, we dont need to be reminded of yanks PC politics, okay?

It's tempting to focus on the poor pacing, overly long run time, plot holes, and general aura of incompetence the characters labor under (Holdo keeping her plan secret despite knowing the Resistance fighters are in a desperate situation and badly demoralized; the amazingly inept plan to go to the casino planet that felt stupidly circuitous the moment it was spoken, let alone executed, in the movie, etc.)<br><br>But while its tempting to look at those things, which make it a bad watch, the worst thing about it is simply Rian Johnson's decision that time and old age had made Luke into essentially the opposite of what he was, to the point where the audience feels disgust with a person they were fond of. Luke is an apathetic jerk. It may subvert audience expectations, but only because it demonstrates a complete disrespect for the original trilogy that birthed the franchise.<br><br>Finally, this movie doesn't just damage the original trilogy, it also retroactively makes the Force Awakens look like a time bomb of bad ideas that have now gone off. The decisions to have the First Order just replace the Empire, Snoke replace the Emperor, Luke replace Obi Wan as a Jedi who taught a corrupted pupil... it all undermined the accomplishments of the first films, but at least the audience believed we'd get a serious and intelligent effort in the Last Jedi to answer the questions of how that happened. No such effort was made. Force Awakens was derivative and never thought two steps ahead. The Last Jedi cements that no effort was put into thinking those things through, while taking a seemingly perverse pleasure in tainting whatever fond feelings you still had for Luke Skywalker.<br><br>I'd prefer to give this movie zero stars if I could, but since the lowest score you can give is half a star, I'll say that the half-star goes to the music, which remains stellar (John Williams has never disappointed with any soundtrack, the soundtrack is the only good thing to come out of this movie)., 0.5,  Christopher B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/914056502/
 Wow. I suspected I wasn't going to like this chapter of the Star Wars saga but I had no idea it would wind up spraying figurative fecal matter over my appreciation for the whole series. It is just so very bad in every regard expect for the visual. No logic, rhyme or reason to anything. No room for it I guess, with all the PC crap jam packed in there. Who knew a light speed engine on a hulk of metal was the ultimate anti ship weapon all along? Who knew you could open doors into space and simply pull stuff in from the other side. Why not simply ban white men from the franchise altogether (except for roles as evil clowns of course) and be done with it? You're not fooling anyone you know. Oh and throw in some more cute critters while you're at it. And choke on 'em. F*ck Star Wars and f'ck Disney., 0.5,  Honk M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977047019/

 Its garbage, and I really tried hard to hide my passionate Star Wars fan self from being biased, but everything about this movie is garbage, the Mary Sue is no more, she is a Rey a Mary Sue turned up to 11, what have you done to Luke? NO STOP, I almost don't mind the agenda pushing in this movie, its tasteless but not a deal breaker for me, but the boring side stories the boring main """"plot"""", have these people ever heard of continuity? So this is after Death Star but bigger 3.0 is destroyed and there is no Resistan.... oh sorry Rebels again left? Bullshit <br>I had my issues, big ones with the prequels, but I think this movie made me love them, at least those feels like star wars movies. This, feels like a stupid tv show that stole shit from star wars, 0.5,  Fer B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977047028/
 Did this movie ruin Star Wars? Of course not but it didn't make it better or worse. just whatever. People are pointing fingers at the die-hards like our expectations were too high Maybe but I argue that's Disney's fault for marketing the movie the way they did. JJ already created intriguing mysteries that were changing he Star Wars lore. I don't know why critics are defending this movie saying sw fans don't want anything new. Are you kidding me? We've been waiting for something new FOREVER. It's obvious that they didn't have a game plan for this franchise. I'll still see episode 9 but I don't know if I care considering what they did to snoke. The fans have been waiting for some backstory on this foool since day one and they trolled us. The worst part is they'd knew we'd be upset but did it anyways. I was nervous about jj coming back but now maybe not. If story continuity is synonymous with fan service then I'll take a fan service movie. At least the fans pay attention to your story elements, 2.5,  Roy P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/909938213/
 After seeing this movie having digested what I saw over the last week. I have to say I don't know why fans are complaining about the movie. Personally and I can only speak personally I loved the film. It, in my opinion, was as good as the original trilogy which I have seen hundreds of times now. Yes, it threw the force awakens under the bus. Its what I love about the film. It wasn't like the force awakens which is just a recycled script. The last Jedi was original. The resistance now needs to rebuild. The characters are fleeing for their lives. I can't wait to see the next one., wts,  Philip N, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/860691076/

 I have been watching RT since before the movie opened. I am another person that set up an account to voice some comments.<br><br>First, to all you people with the review " The best movie 5 stars !!" Why, do you not take the time to list all the good points for you in the movie ? You are making a comment and giving high marks ..why? To push up the RT score for no reason? Or is it your intention to troll other people reading the comments ?<br><br>If all you are going to do is say how much you loved the movie, and how great it was and how fresh you thought it was....and other horse shit, you just look like a jackass. be honest, and take the fucking time to write the reasons why you liked it, as so many, many people have that DID not like the movie, have explained in detail why.<br><br>I see a lot of new " Wow I loved it ! Great , fresh, well written, love the new characters. Dont listen to the negative reviews they are butt hurt fans boys, it is the best star wars movie ever ! " That is just garbage. You look like a retard if this is all you have to say, and 90% of everyone reading here knows your a fool and a liar. <br><br>Everyone has an opinion, perfect, give your true opinion with some details why, or why you did not like the movie. <br><br>I can say 100% I hate this movie, and I am not a huge giant star wars fan. I like it, I have seen them all. But this movie fails at so many levels it is astonding. The plot ( what plot ?? ) is horrible. There should be a F- rating on here or Negative 5 stars. <br><br>I stand by the comments of so many other people here... the vast majority by the look of things. I agree with every negative comment about this film. I do not need to write all the points I disliked, as some 3000+ people before me have listed point by point the negatives.<br><br>But I have seen very few honest positive reviews with details why they liked it. <br><br>I give 1/2 a star for seeing Luke Skywalker, the visuals and the music score.<br><br>The rest of the movie with its social agenda, idiotic plots and fucking stupid story.... what the fuck am I saying there is no story ! Its a fucking mess , and that is the fucking truth.<br><br>Dont go see this, wait for the DVD ...there should be a lot in the garbage soon, or bargain basement DVD retailers selling at a loss.<br><br>This will rank as the lowest of all the movies for star wars. Sure... it has made money, with the huge fan base that was a given in. But..... it was a one time deal, all those people that paid money to go see this....many, many ,amny will not be back to see whatever the hell Episode 9 is.

 TL;DR: if you want to see a StarWars or a good film, don't watch this movie at all cost.<br>Nice visuals. Breaking the inner consistency and narrative coherence with itself, previous episode and full saga. Worst service to fans. Extremely cheap script writing, failing flatly and systematically humiliating any reference and fans at the same time. Playing destruction of a myth, without any talent, blatantly without actually knowing what it destroys, and nothing to propose instead. Please stop the massacre. And some people get paid millions to write this script or to validate it..., 0.5,  Valentin L, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977047503/

 Star Wars has always been politically correct. From the beginning there were strong female characters and people of color. What made those original movies so good however were the writing, acting, and revolutionary production. I felt like Force Awakens had that as well, and although stylized and sleek to the point where it seems to lose some magic, it still managed to bridge all the worlds together and still be interesting. This movie seemed like it was written by 10 people who were not communicating with one another, the movie then taped together and white-washed with random lessons about meat being wrong, capitalism being bad, males being weak and awful, and something about horse racing? This would have been completely OK if there were also a plot to go with it. But there wasn't. Instead we saw a slow speed chase throughout the film that made no sense and could have been avoided by warping in front of the target or sending tie fighters around the target. Luke Skywalker is Mel Gibson now. Finn exists only to be saved by Rey, who without training is magically the most powerful person in the galaxy, and Kylo is a confused teenager who can't stop losing at everything. And who was Snoak? No one knows and it doesn't matter because he never learned about how to safely point a light saber away from you. I always thought light saber safety was like force 101 but Snoak slept through that lesson. Also a physically dead character is still alive. So good luck with all of that JJ. I think Rian Johnson really screwed you here. You're Lukeless and Snoakless and somehow you have to figure out what to do with a dead actor that is still somehow alive in your movie. Also, unless you one-up Johnson and make the new god-emperor of the rebellion ultra diverse you're going to get hash-tagged. I gave this movie two stars, because there were,sort of, light sabers in it., 2.0,  Brian T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/807733636/

 I've been lurking for awhile and reading reviews. People have done a good job deconstructing this movie and pointing its flaws, esp. with how they dealt with Luke, but I have something to add with regard to Rey.<br><br>The most important friendship established in TFA was Rey and Finn's. Remember how devastated Rey was when she thought Finn was dead or had a chance of dying? Remember Rey calling Kylo a "monster" after he killed Han, the only father figure she'd ever had? <br><br>Well all of that doesn't matter anymore. It's heavily implied that Rey and Kylo have a thing for each other in TLJ. Imagine developing romantic feelings with someone who, just last week, intentionally wounded and almost kills your first, life-long, and childhood best friend. Imagine developing romantic feelings for someone who just murdered your father, a day after you called him a murderer. Remember, this is the Rey who screamed out Finn's name like he was her only friend (he was) when he was getting entangled by the Rathtars. This is the Rey got all teary-eyed at even the thought of Finn's leaving her and the Resistance to flee.<br><br>Is Rey an amnesiac? Rian Johnson shows utter disrespect to both Finn and Rey, and esp. to their friendship. Their friendship is now reduced to worthlessness. The same with her relationship with Han. What does Finn's and Han's friendship mean to Rey? NOT MUCH AT ALL in light of all this.<br><br>Now you might argue that Rey, because she is the paradigm of hope, would always see the best in people and so would hope that Kylo would turn from his evil ways. They even have some things in common, two powerful wielders of the force n all (tho for some reason she is way stronger than him already, just look at the throne room scene). But still. You're telling me she's getting all horny for this guy who just did these things to these people? BS. Rey would be more loyal to her friends and family than that.<br><br>To top all this off, Rian Johnson portrays her attraction to Kylo as a *good* thing. Lolol. Not even as in any way bad. Remember: Luke stumbles in upon them force skyping in the hut as if they're doing a terrible thing, but Luke is presented as the intrusive one and the one at fault (Rey immediately lays into him). The morals are just so ass-backwards in this story. Poe is portrayed as the clown while Admiral Holdo plans an 'escape' but doesn't tell her top troops what she's planning to do, leading to a well-deserved coup. And then she has the audacity to wait until 90% of the Resistance is dead before she does her all-too-late kamikaze. Ugh. Amazing how a movie can retroactively make a previous movie's most important friendships and character development worse and meaningless., 1.0,  Kylos A, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977047484/
 R tomatoes refreshed while review was being written. Nasty. In essence star wars has numerous illogical motivations that undermine large portions of screen time for the sake of what I believe to be ideological possession and the proliferation of political propaganda. In the future, a better score will be granted to a better movie, which is to say, logically concise and fits in the current frame of the star wars universe., 0.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977047471/

 If your going to make a star wars movie without any star wars material, then call it something different, at least i don't go in there expecting anything star wars related. If it's going to be about a grumpy old weirdo hermit with a milk deficiency living in a stone hut surrounded by alien nuns and lactating camels then just say so. If it's going to be about an angry kid dressed in his big boy halloween costume with a light up sword who is really mad at his mommy and daddy (and uncle) then just say so, if it's really about the estrogen rebellion, resistance, or the super secret no boys allowed slumber party club demanding to be in charge and given the keys to the really big ship then just say so, if it's going to be 2 hours of really big space ships slowly chasing some other smaller ships with lots of yelling and finger pointing until everyone runs out of gas, then just say so, if it's going to be a political statement targeting the hypocrisy of the industrial military complex and how they play both sides for the fools only to give the really cool stuff to the first order and the left overs to the good gals then just say so, if it's going to be a comedy with women floating through space, prank phone calls, a boring old hermit with jedi dementia, kamikaze style soap box derby and roasting little groundhogs then just say so, if your going to take years of story and character development and then ignore all of it then just say so, If your not going to have Luke Skywalker in the Last Jedi movie then just say so, putting his picture on the poster is borderline misleading, I'm just saying, the Star Wars title really through me off, I thought I was going to see a Star Wars movie., 0.5,  Derek%20 J, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976981047/
 I waited until I saw it for the third time before giving it a rating. I love this movie. Great story with plenty of action. It is also the most emotional Star Wars movie ever. The only reason why I give it 4.5 instead of 5 is that it feels fairly disconnected from the greater Star Wars canon (very few links to all of the book, TV shows, etc.)., 4.5,  Matthew T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977046933/
 This was a good film if it was stand alone but a terrible Star Wars film, it badly damaged the original trilogy and made TFA pretty worthless. The plot holes from TFA to TMJ are enough to sink a battleship...making Luke a coward is a travesty....this completely failed to continue the excitement from TFA and will prob hurt the anticipation for EP 9...I will see EP 9 but I am not as excited for it after this disaster.

 The film ruins Star Wars, something Lucas couldn't even do over 3 movies with Jar-Jar and Hadin's help. Rian, the movie is bad and you should feel bad. TFA sucked, but at least it didn't kill the largest film franchise to ever exist. People are going to look at failed films now and call them "Rians", or damn, that film got "Rian Johnsoned".

 Easily the best Star Wars movie I've seen. Awesome fight scenes, truly interesting themes, VERY intelligent manipulations of audience expectations, and strong cinematography throughout. And most importantly, it evoked the same feelings for me as the original trilogy.<br><br>People who rail on the film are mostly diehard fans who are upset that this film features dynamic characters and adds real alterations to the traditional Star Wars formula...or people who took those fans at their word when they said the movie was bad. I won't go into detail for fear of spoilers, but real people change over the course of their lives, and Luke's changes in outlook due to the events between Episode 6 and this episode are not only believable but the reason that he is one of this episode's most interesting characters. The dozens of other "plot holes" I've heard brought up are (with the singular exception of Holdo's poor communication with Poe) simply failures to read between the lines.<br><br>This is a very clever film that also expects a more from its audience than the original trilogy, and the (at the time of this writing) 90% critic score reflects that., 5.0,  Asada S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977046879/

 This movie crushed my Star Wars spirit for reasons I cannot explain. Despite what many others thought, I loved The Force Awakens and if nothing else, it left most people with a bit of curiosity and maybe, optimism. I love Rey and I feel her arc was hurt by Finn and Rose's Candle Bight side story. Rather than expanding the depth of the characters we had been introduced to in Episode 7, more characters, multicultural and female were thrown at us simply to dodge the ridicule of our current society. Meanwhile, Admiral Ackbar was blown up into the dismal abyss of space and only mentioned once after... I feel this was a tip off of what TLJ planned to do to the Star Wars Universe as a whole, at least Luke went out with a bit more dignity... not much but a little. All of the males in this film were either written to be chauvinistic blow hards (i.e. Poe, what were they thinking? This is not the same guy we met in Episode 7) or they were killed off. I was all for the girl power but not this way, not at the expense of the male characters we have always loved or at the expense of the franchise itself. <br><br>The R2-D2 scene with Luke, the Porgs and the fact that this was Carrie Fisher's last appearance in a Star Wars film are the primary reason my rating is 2 stars and not 1., 2.0,  Jill H, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/785407736/
 Awful, awful, awful! Actually makes TFA a decent movie! It also has the uncanny ability to actually make the 1977-83 movies less interesting! I normally do not "review" movies on websites but I had to get this off my chest. This is the first Star Wars movie I did not see twice! Where does one go for the next movie?! So the new big bad guy is Kylo Ren!? Does anyone care about the next movie!? This movie seemed like a culmination not a 2nd movie of a trilogy! All of these new characters suck and are unlikable!

(I don't even know how the hell Kilo turn around the ship after shooting inside the big ship hangar!) Finn wasted, same as Phasma, IDIOTIC characters (yes.. I'm talking about Rose) with idiotic motivations... a pile of shit over Luke!... a newbie with less than a week with a lightsaber in her hands winning over guys with entire lives training!! is like going into Mike Tison's house and asking him to be your teacher... he say no, so you start punching a damn pillow... even if his retired and old as shit, he's gonna take the crap out of you!!!<br><br>DON'T LOOSE YOUR TIME ON THIS!!!

 There's absolutely no way this could have a 49% user rating with all the 1/2 and 1 star reviews. This is proof that the rating system at RT is completely rigged. I saw this film opening night and many weeks later, I'm still angry about it. Rian Johnson, Kathleen Kennedy, and the whole gang at Disney completely destroyed the Star Wars saga with TLJ. The plot was full of holes. Apparently, there is gravity in space and Leia is now Superman. Luke is an angry as*hole who would rather hide in solitude, sucking space cow milk and spear fishing than helping his sister and the rebellion. btw - why wouldn't Luke just lift the fish out of the water using the force than jumping across a canyon with a huge spear? Also, now the force can be used to survive space, control lightning, and project yourself across a galaxy. If this was true, why wouldn't Luke, Obi-Wan, or Yoda project themselves behind the Emperor / Snoke and strike them down with lightning? What a ridiculous farce. The entire movie sucked as* and the creative team (**points finger at Rian Johnson**) should be ashamed of this film. Absolutely the worst PC piece of crap I've ever seen in my life. Horrible as a Star Wars movie, even worse if it was a stand alone film. Also, don't get me started about Rose Rose Binks. All characters and story lines destroyed from the entertaining TFA. I can't imagine how JJ Abrams and George Lucas could praise this garbage. JJ Abrams is now tasked with finding a way to ignore this mess and build something decent from the rubble. As for me, this is the last SW movie I will pay to see in theatres. I loved Rogue One and liked TFA, but hated TLJ.

 An action packed visually amazing star wars film. The story on the other hand is nonsense. There's an entire side plot that is completely useless and unnecessary if the characters communicated to each other. The side plot was created just to fill time.

 While I understand what director Rian Johnson was trying to do - his writing style and direction literally killed the film. Every major character arc and loose thread from Force Awakens is either ignored or destroyed entirely. Every beloved character is brushed aside or unceremoniously discarded. What's left behind is an often awkwardly-funny, shallow shell of a star wars movie that feels overlong, and often times takes us down unnecessary paths. Little respect was given to star wars lore here and with the mantra "everything old must die" - what its replaced with doesn't instill much excitment for the future of the series. JJ Abrams has a lot of work to do if he wants to save this trilogy., 2.0,  Glen G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/806671859/

There's an entire side plot that is completely useless and unnecessary if the characters communicated to each other. The side plot was created just to fill time. Tons of plot holes and pointless characters. A bizarre entry into the franchise. Lots of questions and no answers as characters are introduced and killed off. Yet, we trudge onward., 3.0,  Gus C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977046847/
 While I understand what director Rian Johnson was trying to do - his writing style and direction literally killed the film. Every major character arc and loose thread from Force Awakens is either ignored or destroyed entirely. Every beloved character is brushed aside or unceremoniously discarded. What's left behind is an often awkwardly-funny, shallow shell of a star wars movie that feels overlong, and often times takes us down unnecessary paths. Little respect was given to star wars lore here and with the mantra "everything old must die" - what its replaced with doesn't instill much excitment for the future of the series. JJ Abrams has a lot of work to do if he wants to save this trilogy., 2.0,  Glen G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/806671859/
 It definitely kills the past... and present and future for that matter., 0.5,  Ted S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976954820/
 Worst Star Wars movie ever...<br>Please boycott Disney Star Wars, 0.5,  Paul S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976961524/
 I initially dismissed all the cries of "terrible" and angry YouTube rants as "butthurt fanboys". I was wrong. It really is THAT bad!<br>I give one and a half for good visuals but story, character and everything thing that matters deserves zero stars. <br><br>Frankly I'm amazed its scoring 49% with the audience. Judging from most verdicts I'm seeing here it should be more like 20%, 1.5,  Sarah F, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977046751/
 Agree with Mark Hamill on this one...<br>"I said to Rian, I said, "Jedi's don't give up. I mean even if he had a problem he would maybe take a year to try and regroup, but if he made a mistake he would try and right that wrong." So right there we had a fundamental difference, but it's not my story anymore. It's somebody else's story, and Rian needed me to be a certain way to make the ending effective. That's the crux of my problem. Luke would never say that. I'm sorry. Well in this version, see I'm talking about the George Lucas Star Wars. This is the next generation of Star Wars, so I almost had to think of Luke as another character. Maybe he is Jake Skywalker.", 0.5,  Joe P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/907226223/
 Like The Force Awakens (TFA), I found The Last Jedi (TLJ) to be derivative of the original trilogy, though admittedly less so than TFA. The end fight was straight out of the Hoth battle scene in Empire, and Luke's reluctance to train Rey was reminiscent to Yoda's reluctance to train Luke. That said, I liked TLJ better than TFA. My biggest regret for this movie is that I won't ever get to see Luke (or Leia) kicking tail and taking names again. I waited decades to see Han, Luke, and Leia get the band back together and do precisely that, and now it won't ever happen. After TFA, JJ Abrams may be the biggest troll the world has seen, and I'm not sure if writer-director Rain Johnson is in on the joke, or did the best with what JJ Abrams handed him. Either way, the movie left me feeling unfulfilled., 1.5,  Jason R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976960333/
 A little piece of me died after watching this.<br>An utter ABORTION of a movie., 1.0,  Clarke J, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977046736/
 I am not a bot, I too created an account to add my voice of disgust.<br><br>Some words/phrases that come to mind every time I think of this movie:<br>- Garbage<br>- Dumpster fire<br>- WTF<br>- Horrendous<br>- Cringy<br>- Boring <br>- Dimwitted<br>- Shortsighted<br>- Socia justice propaganda<br>- Inconsistent<br>- Slow<br>- Disappointing<br>- Terrible<br>- Insulting<br>- Juvenile<br>- Plot holes<br>- #notmyluke<br>- #notmystarwars<br>- FLAT OUT BAD<br><br>It was a really rotten movie. Almost as rotten as the fake audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. But, that is another story., 1.0,  Allison D, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977046729/
 Way better than VII. Absolutely loved it., 5.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977046727/
 Why this get a golden tomato? Should be squashed green tomato!<br>This was a very bad movie. I like The Force Awakens very, very much but this movie is very childish and silly. I don't care about Rey and Kylo anymore. Luke is dead. So what now? Who cares!, 1.0,  ZhuRong J, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977046713/
 Best Star Wars movie yet. Rian Johnson's work as a director really turned out well, though the humor is kinda bad, I agree, but the story and cinematography is beautiful. It's so unexpected and unpredictable, you think something is gonna happen but then something else happens and it just blows your mind. Amazing movie!, 5.0,  Sander S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976771165/
 This movie was a four star for me. This isn't five star because there are not a lot of the older characters, it is starting to be like a "new generation", but otherwise it was pretty good, it had some humor and some good twist's., 4.0,  Kaley H, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977046691/
 Brilliant visuals and some key exciting moments but overall a movie that abuses the long loved franchise characters and throws away many of the previous movies plot points to leave a final episode with no direction or excitement whatsoever. Cringeworthy characters and bad writing result in a fanserving mess filled with out of place scenes and comedy relief worthy of a 5 year old., 1.5,  Scott H, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/955021504/
 Good actors, had potential ruined by forced humour and poor story design., 0.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977046704/
 A movie as bad as the prequels but for different reasons., 0.5,  Thang T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/908453691/
 The 1 star is for John Williams even though he just rehashed his old themes. The half star is for the CGI. <br><br>Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy deserve MINUS stars! They have no respect for our intelligence as an audience. And I have no respect for their product., 1.5,  Charlene%20 E, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977046700/
 What can I say about this movie that has not already been said? <br>I do understand the want to avoid becoming a carbon copy of The Empire Strikes back, but in trying to be different, this movie failed in every possible way (except the music and visuals: the movie DOES look quite good.)<br><br>avoiding spoilers, The plot was average at best, the new characters were unlikable, pointless, and needless. The treatment of pre-established characters and lore (namely Luke, Ackbar, and Leia) was downright disrespectful. <br><br>Also, it was politically charged with feminism and SJW propaganda, and the plot-lines that Were genuinely interesting from the force awakens were DROPPED like the bombs in the first act.<br><br>I went into the movie EXPECTING disappointment, and i was STILL let down., 1.0,  Jesse G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/949369917/
 Not quite as irredeemably bad as some are saying. <br>More like "Meh! Could take it or leave it." <br>Left me feeling totally indifferent. But most seem to strongly hate it! In fact, I'm surprised the audience score is so high!, 2.0,  Jennifer B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977046686/
 Lifelong Star Wars fan here...I thought this movie was excellent, maybe 4th best behind ESB, ANH, and Jedi with Rogue 1 close behind. Like ESB, TLJ dramatically expands the scope of the Star Wars universe--this is in direct contrast to what I thought was the play-it-safe recasting of ANH that was TFA. I love how it re-democratizes the series: you don't have to be in the Skywalker family to use the force or to lead a rebellion. I also love how it didn't try to shoehorn every character and their backstory in to the film no matter how silly it made their origin story (lookin' at you 3PO). And the last Holdo scene...wow. I have never heard so many audible gasps from an audience (including me) as I did when that occurred. And then it happened again when we learn how Luke had tricked Kylo! Yes, there are some plot holes, and yes, the whole Canto Bight foray was probably unnecessary. But I find those to be weak arguments against what is otherwise a fantastic film. An easy 5 stars!, 5.0,  Craig R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/909411818/
 what has disney done to this series. Everyone we wanted to see finish out the story is gone. We have new characters no one cares about. Is anyone scared by the new darth vader replacement? What is the point of bringing like back if all he does is sit on an island. Just about as bad as it gets., 1.0,  joseph e, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976367008/
 First thing I did after seeing this movie was sign Henry Walsh's petition on the "Change" website to strike it from canon. It has 84,000 signatures so far. And when you've seen this garbage, you'll see why., 1.0,  Jack S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977046675/
 When Billy-Dee Williams was cast as Lando, it wasn't to fill a quota. It was because he had the charm, charisma, looks, voice, screen-presence and talent to bring that character to life.<br> <br>By contrast, this film (especially Rose and Purple Hair) are cast specifically with thnic/gender quotas in mind. And they're terrible and annoying characters for that reason.<br><br>"That is why you fail, Johnson!", 1.0,  Fatine A, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977046655/
