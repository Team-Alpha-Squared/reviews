Mark Hamill told them they were wrong and they should have listened. Rey was our best new character from the series and they\'ve cheapened her story by leaving out any possible opportunity for character development in this movie. Instead they introduce Rose, the new Jar-Jar Binks, to take a trip back to prequel-land in Vegas and waste a half hour of another great new character\'s time. Meanwhile some lady from the Hunger Games is wasting the other half of the movie in a low-speed, super boring and pointless chase scene. JJ Abrams set this guy up so perfectly to make an awesome movie - so many cool new characters, interesting mysteries to be answered. All of that was either glossed over, left completely unaddressed, or resolved in some lame jokey way. In an interview with this director in Rolling Stone, he said when he got the job someone gave him a model Millenium Falcon. The first thing he did was threw it across the room to see if it would fly. Of course, it broke. That\'s this movie.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Pain J."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977050638/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Pain J</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> I created an account just to BEG true Star Wars fans NOT to see this movie.

They run off to casino world, and then spend a huge amount of time making political points on animal rights and rich people benefiting off poor people and so on.<br><br>other plot points ruin the universe and the premise of star wars in general, they weaponise hyperspace, now any ship can destroy an entire fleet, why exactly was the empire a threat, why would starkiller base or the death star be a significant threat?<br><br>This is a terrible movie for so many reasons, I could go on, but its depressing.

I still think this is one of the best Star Wars movies ever. I saw episode 1 when it came out in 1977. It\'s hard to overstate the impact that movie made on films in general. It was so innovative, it set a new bar for flies, and ushered in the beginning of an era, where film makes could create movie out of anything they could imagine. It also had an allegory for the times, as the country was just emerging from the horror of Watergate and a President determined to ignore the law and constitution in a dictatorial manner. Fast forward 40 years and the technology has continued to evolve, but the story telling has improved immensely. No movie is likely to approach the impact of the first Star Wars. Before seeing the Last Jedi, my son and I binged watched every Star Wars films in chronological order of the story, including Rogue 1 between Episode 3 and 4. The Last Jedi really at two levels strikes off in a new direction. When Kylo Ren tells Rey, "Let the past die," Kylo Ren says. "Kill it, if you have to. That\'s the only way to become who you were meant to be." I think he is voice of the Director speaking to the fans of the past. Don\'t get me wrong, I love the past. I still think that Sean Connery was really the only great Bond. But I\'m glad to see the franchise move in a new direction with new characters and story lines. They can\'t survive recycling the past. Luke had to die, as Ben and Yoda died. He passed in the same way, by disappearing and leaving his cloak. I\'m also glad to see a new and much more diverse set of actors. John Boyega was terrific as Finn. Benicio Del Toro is wonderful as the code breaker, a combination of quick wit and conniving. So as Kylo Ren asks Rey to leave the past, he is the voice of the Director, asking fans of the franchise to do the same. I highly recommend this film. Just leave the past behind and you will enjoy as a step into the future.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="ronankelly012gmailco"> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/976868769/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Ronan K</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="50"></span></div> Crowd pleaser.

I have zero investment in any characters that remain in this series and don\'t care what happens in the future with this franchise. Congrats to Rian and Kathleen, you turned something that you could count on Billions of $ for years to come into a series that will fall apart now that you have effectively eliminated roughly half of the fan base. Worst Star Wars movie ever, terrible story, what are supposed to be fan favorite characters now have no emotional connection to many fans any longer so I imagine a huge drop in ticket sales for Episode IX, I know who\'s money they won\'t be getting. I can\'t imagine how anyone likes this crap.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/976986450/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/10215123530624776/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/976986450/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> This whole story sucks! Every male character is ether a coward or a hot head . All female characters are hero\'s. I am not sexist but kinda weird. Also Luke Skywalker story is terrible. He is coward hiding. He did not want to be found but made a map within r2-d2. Stupid. Also the jokes are stupid. If I wanted to watch jokes with Star Wars I would watch Star Wars robot chicken. Not one light saber connected during this movie. That like watching a medevil movie and no swords hit. Also there are no auto pilot in Star Wars. Lady can\'t get on escape ship because she has to pilot the ship. Stupid! Also she did a Kamikaze into ship which pretty much wiped them all out. So now they will make ship with robots that will Kamikaze into ship!!stupid. Also the 1st order is chasing the resistance why the hell didn\'t they call in other ships to cut them off. The shop was supposedly going faster than the 1st order ship so why were they able to stay right behind the whole time. Stupid!!! Learned more about stupid rose than snoke. Luke has a light saber that Kylo and Rey broke but Kylo does not notice. Stupid!!! Luke goes it like bitch. And it only takes 3 lessons to be a Jedi. Terrible writing. I loved Star Wars my whole life but now it is dead it took Gearge Lucas 4 years to release a movie. So people say prequels suck but at lease they made sense this movie made no sensel!</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Chris C."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977050484/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Chris C</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/rating/wts.png"> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="wts"></span></div> The movie was ok. Just meh to me. The acting was good, visually great, Rey and Poe storylines were cool. But I felt disappointed when leaving the theater. The character \'Supreme Leader Snoke\' was wasted. Such a great character but he is killed off like nothing and no answers to how he came to be in charge of the First Order, or how he formed a relationship with Ben Solo. No mention of The Knights of Ren. No explanation of what Rey saw in her force vision from episode 7. Actually no good explanations to many of the plot points from episode 7. Generally I like a saga to follow all the story points from one to the next. I dont like to be given cliff hangers, wait 2 years and then get nothing. That was very very disappointing. All that is bad and yet there is worse, this movie destroyed the heroic legacy of Luke Skywalker. The way he goes out is pathetic and cowardly. Rian Johnson made bad decision after bad decision with this movie and most of it\'s characters. MEH</div> </div> </div>']
