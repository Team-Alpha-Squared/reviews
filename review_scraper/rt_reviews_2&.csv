First off, the battle at the beginning and end are great. I thoroughly enjoyed them. Now for all the stuff in the middle. The majority of this movie is devoted to a slow speed chase, where the bad guy are literally just waiting for the good guys to run out of gas. Everything Poe Dameron does is literally pointless, and could have been avoided with one conversation between him and his superior. <br>Speaking of pointless, there is no reason for Finn to be in this movie. He goes off on his own adventure, that end in him failing his quest, but it doesn\'t matter because his quest wasn\'t necessary in the first place. <br> All Finn accomplished in the entire film is to free some space animals from captivity, but presumably they will just be re-captured. Are these animals important to the plot? No. Okay, moving on.<br> The big bad from the previous movie Snoke, is also revealed to be pointless, along with Luke, who Rey seeks out for training, but he decided not to train her.<br> In short, this movie seemed like a filler episode of a TV show, except instead of not movie the plot along it actually set the plot back from where it was last film.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="thad13"> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/963717105/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Thaddeus R</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 15, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="20"></span></div> Another mediocre Star Wars film with crappy plot writing and beautiful flashy effects.

Leia flying, Rey and Ben jedi skyping, Luke not even fighting... In addition to this massacre, the jokes are mocking the design of the space ships (like the flatiron one, come on)...

I\'d give it 5 stars, but I\'m always hesitant to do that because perfection doesn\'t exist. Let me preface this with the fact that I have never been a huge star wars fan; the first SW movie I loved was Rogue One. However, I\'ve always had great love and respect for the world of SW because I just love stuff like that. Because of that, I have the emotional distance needed to see that this is what the franchise needed. They can\'t keep telling the same story over and over and over again, that\'s not how...well, anything works. Besides the fact that that would\'ve gotten old with Empire , 70s storytelling techniques simply don\'t cut it for modern audiences anymore.<br><br>This movie is gorgeous, both in visuals and in character work. It gives the characters the ultimate respect: it makes them real people. This is most obvious and up-front with Luke. He was never the Legend of Luke Skywalker, he was a bit of a dumbass, wide-eyed kid from Tatooine who had, like, a week of formal training and a lot of natural talent, and even he bought into his own legend. That\'s why the ultimate realization of truth affected him so much, the same as it\'s doing for all those outraged "fans." <br><br>The fact is, if star wars fans wants star wars to keep going at all, the universe NEEDS to grow and evolve and that means letting the characters within the story grow and evolve. It\'s not "ruining their childhood," the OT will always exist, but it will bring new fans more into the fold. For the first time, I actually give a shit about Luke Skywalker, and that\'s because he feels like a real person. I\'m aware this isn\'t the most comprehensive review, but I needed to get some thoughts out here</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Kathy V."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977055612/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Kathy V</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 15, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="50"></span></div> This movie is awesome!

You heard correctly. <br><br>Luke Skywalker returns as a completely wasted and incorrectly written character who does things untrue to his last appearance in Return of The Jedi. <br><br>The humor is horribly out of place throughout the entire movie, except for one moment involving a tree branch.

Slipshod story telling. Bad jokes and too many of those. The new characters are not very interesting, esp. Rey. To me, she\'s *too* "Mary Sue". I have yet to see her fail at anything. Flaws make for a good character and Rey has none. Also, I\'m not too fond of Daisy Ridley\'s portrayal of this character. Poe seems to be relegated to being a great pilot, but emasculated out of the cockpit. Finn....I still don\'t know about him. Every time you think he\'s going to go one way, he goes the other. Very confusing. And if Kylo is supposed to be a bad guy, he\'s not bad enough. He\'s not charismatic or imposing enough to take seriously. His redemption in ep. 9, if there is one, will seem lackluster and possibly pointless. <br>But, one thing I did like out of "Last Jedi" was Luke. A lot of people hated what Rian Johnson did to him, but I totally get it. He had a moment in his life where he was going to do something he would have regretted (killing Kylo Ren). I think that got to him so much, he felt like he needed to exile himself because it went against everything of who he was.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Greta I."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977007036/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Greta D</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 15, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="10"></span></div> Yes, I am a new user who created this account to rate this mockery of a Star Wars movie. No, I am not a troll, a hater , a white supremacist, or part of the "conspiracy group" to bring down Disney. And yes, I think the "critics" and the raving idiots giving this movie 5 stars are simple-minded, half-wits. First let me start off with the fact that I am more of "The Hobbit" and "Lord of the rings " girl, however I love Star Wars, and especially the The Clone Wars and Revenge of the Sith. I was not born when the original triology was released, but I found it to be mesmerizing. I don\'t really understand why the prequels are so despised by some fans since they told the story of how everything started, including the journey of Anakin Skywalker from a Jedi to a Sith. I loved Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kanobi and Hayden Christensen as Darth Vader. They both had depth and convincibility that the new characters lack in many respects. I even enjoyed Darth Sidius (the Lord Sith) manipulative and conniving ways, he knew just what to say and when to say it in order to bring the worst in Anakin.<br>The Force Awakens was passable, however I hated that they so quickly got rid off Han Solo, but I was excited at the promise of Luke Skywalker in the upcoming movie. What a mistake on my part...Instead of getting the Grand Master Jedi, who could have replaced Yoda as the leading Jedi, I lived to see this marvelous character milk a walrus, drink green milk , and catch the fakest looking fish possible. Then we have to listen to the stalest, most forced , copy cat dialogue between Rey and Luke. With Rey trying to talk Luke into training her so she can convert Rylo( another idea borrowed from previous Star Wars films). Then we witness Rey\'s 5 minute lesson on how to become a Jedi when she slices a rock and watches it roll down the cliff breaking the card of the poor frog looking caretakers of the Jedi Temple( one of the few comedic moments I found funny). Rey becomes so powerful that she even defeats her teacher Luke - totally unbelievable. Then we get the utterly boring and completely illogical space ship chase, the made-to look ridiculous general of the First Order and the absolutely annoying, condescending, arrogant and unlikable Admiral Hux, the purple haired lady. The only satisfying thing about her character was when se decided to stay in the mother ship and kill herself in order for the other pitiful bunch of losers to escape (one would think that such an advance ship would have autopilot and would not need anyone staying behind, but as I said I was overjoyed to see her go). If only Admiral Hux has told Poe and Finn about her plan, there would be no need for the Casino scenes, but the "heroic lady "did not want to appear as a martyr or a hero so she kept it all to herself. <br>And then we get those stupid looking birds-Porges. They were everywhere , in all the scenes, even in Chewbaka\'s spaceship...how did they get there..noone knows. <br>The Rose character with her ridiculous haircut, self righteous attitude and constant preaching made me want to puke...especially the forced kiss with Finn and the" we protect what we love" speech. And let me tell you that I do not believe it for a second that Finnor any other man unless blind and deaf would find this utterly unattractive, void of personality abomination of a woman- yes I said it..<br>Now we come to the supposedly ultimate villain Kylo Ren ( since the real Sith and villain Snoke was killed as easy as you chop a mouse). Kylo Ren\'s angry outbursts made him look like un emotionally unstable, almost hormonal mockery of a villain. We are now to believe that this semi-Sith without real knowledge of the Dark side, without any composure or will strength is supposed to be the number one Sith in the galaxy- weak, very weak and implausible. However, when one comes to think about it this parody of a villain might actually succeed because what is left of the resistance are a bunch of losers without manpower or weapons worthy to fight with.<br>And lets not forget the puppet looking Yoda who shows just in time to burn the Jedi Temple, after which bursts into crazy laughter and mocks Luke Skywalker for caring about the Jedi scripts. <br>Luke Skywalker trying to kill his nephew in his sleep without even talking to him first is totally unbelievable and illogical to his character, I would say killing someone in his sleep is low even for a Sith.<br>The "bold moves" and "twists" are nothing new but exact copies of previous SW films down to the scene when Kylo tells Rey that they should both rule the galaxy and create new order; a scene taken from Revenge of the Sith when Anakin tells Patme exactly the same thing before his fight with Obi Wan. <br>The end scenes with Leia were cheese and overly optimistic regarding the condition the resistance was in. Even though we know that at the end they will win, the characters themselves donot know it and should show more humility and contained hope rather than the sure belief in their success. That is what separates the SW from the likes of flicks like The guradians of the Galaxy. Believability, depth and substance over cheap tricks and overly arrogant good guys sure of their success which makes the villains look pitiful and kills the suspense.<br><br>The movie is a total mess, devout of any feeling or depth, the magic is gone buried in forced dialogue, illogical sequence of events and totally forced diversity , the only ethnic group the "creator" RIan Johnson forgot to include is the pygmy man...what a miss Rian, how could you forget the pygmy man?<br>Luke SKywalker needs to come back redeemed. George Lucas must to return. Rian Johnson should not be allowed to direct the Han Solo series, otherwise DIsney you are in for a big loss.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/976924116/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/10155819509917319/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/976924116/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span class="fr small subtle">January 15, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class=""></span></div> No story <br>Dumb ill placed awkwardly timed fails at humor<br>Makes Luke like like Dick<br>Makes all the characters look like fools who are petty little children <br>Unnecessary subplots <br>Useless characters Rose (could been Shrek didn\'t matter )<br>Did I mention no story! <br>No characterization <br>No back story <br>More useless characters Purple hair from JP<br>Now it\'s Princess Mary Space Poppins. <br>Smart characters acting like insane morons<br>Entire movies based on a race to go slow Hey Ricky Bobby want to go Slow, NO!<br>Luke sits on his ass instead of actually getting in the fight<br>Snoke, who, what, when, how, why, where, why the .....,<br><br>Rian Johnson BURN IN HELL you ruined Star Wars!</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/916031987/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/100001315471498/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/916031987/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Matthew W</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 15, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> Fun, but it ruined so many characters and traditions in the Star Wars universe.</div> </div> </div>']
