 What is the internet coming to? If you need any further proof that the majority not all but the majority of very favorable reviews are totally fake. Just in the last few hours alone two positive reviews by members Jason U and Birger S are fishier than a 10 year old can of tuna. Click on their profiles and you will see all you need to know. "Sorry we couldn't find the page you were looking for".<br><br>For a movie that claims to be the ultimate cinematic experience about dealing with ones failures why are the makers of this film so stubborn to admit to making any mistakes at all with this fire dumpster? We can't even trust an impartial website like Rotten Tomatoes any more. Locking the audience score at 49% feels like outright censorship. I am also really amused at the mental gymnastics I see the media do to defend and justify why The Last Jedi didn't quite make the box office dollar numbers that were expected...yes it still made 1.3 billion (no one involved in making this will go hungry) but surely Disney understands that 1) A huge portion of the opening weekend numbers were earned from people like me who had tickets purchased 3 weeks before opening night hoping to see this sequel trilogy's "Empire Strikes Back". Had I any idea this was the movie I would see instead that purchase would not have been made 2) The movie would absolutely have gotten closer to Force Awakens numbers if it was more liked and had the repeat viewings the hardcore fans would have gladly given it. I was 100% prepared to go back and see this movie at least a second and maybe a third time if I was blown away by it. Instead I saw it once and once only felt flipped off by the makers not blown away wish I could have asked for a refund I will not be purchasing the Blu Ray and will not purchase another movie ticket for Disney's idea of this franchise. Again the near total avoidance of this obvious fact by the media defending the performance of this filth is really telling. <br><br>---<br><br>I had to make another comment today after seeing a couple of things on the web the last couple of days. 1) Joseph Gordon Levitt writing a 2000 word essay on why The Last Jedi works. Like seriously why am I being convinced to like this movie? Sorry JGL that is your opinion and this is mine TLJ does not work especially when it comes to Luke. I shouldn't have to watch the thing 3 times or be convinced by the media that I'm wrong. 2) Rian Johnson "putting all the haters" in their place by pulling out the book "The Jedi Path" and referencing a page where it explains that Jedi can do astral projection or whatever. Look that was never my criticism and I love Star Wars but I'm not up on the EU and hard notions of what is 'canon' when it comes to details like this. In my mind during the EU days if it didn't come from Lucas' mouth it was not Star Wars and I mostly ignored that stuff anyways. My problem is that I feel like that was simply the wrong story beat to give the character....but his character was already ruined by that point in the movie so it doesn't really matter to me what is canon or not when we get there. <br><br>And the constant 'gotchya!!' in this movie just pissed me off and left me with a headache. Cripes I can't believe they are calling themselves geniuses and bold when all they did was subvert subvert subvert at every corner. That is not creative it's just "you say black I say white". I could've written that slop. Rian will get paid more than I will ever be paid in 10 lifetimes for writing something anyone in high school drama class could write. It is not clever nor is it brilliant to just do the opposite of what I expect..in every...single...plot thread! NOT CREATIVE AT ALL!! YOU DID NOT CREATE ANYTHING. Here's the thing of course I want you to defy my expectations in some way of course I want surprises and new things that I did not see coming and could not have possibly imagined (pun unintended) on my own. That would have left me yelling "that effing rocked!!!" all the way to the cinema multiple times. But what I want to see in a movie like this are things I am not expecting in a positive creative way. As I've suggested I do not feel like mere subversion is particularly creative and in this case definitely not positive in most places.<br><br>And I just can't let slide the fact that I am getting an anti-capitalist "people with money are evil" message from who? A megalithic multi media corporation worth many many billions of dollars who recently gobbled up just about every bit of current pop culture IP that exists to have complete and total control of. Wow. Facetious much? No more money will I spend on this incarnation of SW.<br><br>I will always cherish my Episodes 1 - VI that will be the Star Wars experience for me and my future family (thank you George Lucas for your beautiful cinematic gifts that never gets old). It is clear the only voice I have left that will be taken seriously is in my wallet and I will use it (or not use it in this case) loud and clear when Solo Episode IX and whatever else is released from Disney under the SW moniker hits the streets. This is not my Star Wars to those who love it enjoy. <br><br>Remember everyone if you don't like this movie you are wrong!<br><br>Peace! <br><br>Original 'review':<br><br>Quick update to my 'review'. Changed star rating to 1 1/2 because I saw a comment that 1/2 star ratings don't count. And on that note 49%? Really? Do I have stupid stamped on my forehead? The media protection of this awfully constructed SW movie is absolutely glaring.<br><br>I am getting tired of being labeled a misogynist because I do not like this film. My favorite movie critic Roger Ebert had this to say about judging movies "A movie is not what it's about it's about how it's about it". On that note it's not the fact that Rey is female I love that idea...that is taking SW in a new direction lovely! The fact that she is the most powerful Jedi without any help or training? That's the "how it's about it" part that this movie fails horribly at. <br><br>At the end of the day I could take all of that except my flavor of Star Wars does not mirror my world...this is where I go to 'escape'. Hard to escape when the galaxy far far away is now only concerned with reminding me of what's going on in my own galaxy. This also ages these films terribly. <br><br>And for the record I do not agree whatsoever with the morons who did the "female free" cut of TLJ on the web. That is just a ridiculous manbaby thing to do that just diminishes the honest arguments decent people have against this film which go far beyond just the feminist messages.<br><br>Original Comments: <br><br>What I had hoped to see from this new trilogy is a passing of the torch. However the approach I am witnessing is not a passing of the torch rather an extinguishing (more like violent drowning) of the old rickety un-edgy torch and lighting some new edgier torch and calling it Star Wars. Wildly disappointed I have no interest in Episode IX at all I am done I do not care one iota what J.J. tries to do. Any attempt at 'redemption' of the subversive plot choices of this film would come across as more contrived than the lazy subversive contrivances here. What's J.J. going to do? Bring Snoke back from the dead? There is no way you could do that that wouldn't be completely ridiculous. Likewise you killed Luke so please just leave him dead. Of course bring him back as a force ghost for an appearance if you want but you've already destroyed his final appearance and influence in the universe 'in the flesh' so don't try to redeem that choice by doing something completely ludicrious with Luke from beyond (ala Yoda summoning lighting). Not that I care because I simply do not want to see Episode IX at all. I'm just saying if you tried to do those ridiculous things it would not bring me back on account of said ridiculousness.<br><br>One more thing I am pretty certain we were all to assume that Luke reached out to R2 at the end of "The Force Awakens" through the Force to allow him to complete the map and invite Rey to come to him. Any other explanation for R2 waking up then is extreme eye rolling deus ex machina / coincidence. And then comes TLJ and tells us Luke has been cut off from the Force for ages so it must be some other contrivance that awoke R2.....please.<br><br>I really liked Rian's work on Breaking Bad (where this subversive style fit much better) and Looper but this feels like he just couldn't get out of his own rug-pulling way on this one. Pull a rug from under me once it might be a genuinely thrilling cinematic surprise pull every single rug in the house from under me and I'm just left annoyed and insulted. <br><br>IMHO, 2.0,  Base C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/971648402/, January 29 2018, 
 I thought this was excellent and I do not understand all the hate it receives. It Honored the original Trilogy but also brought fresh twists. This movie had me from start to finish. Everything about it was great. I cannot praise this movie enough. If you havnt seen it yet WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!?! Go see it., 5.0,  Sean S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/857766571/, January 29 2018, 
 "1/2 star and voting " not Interested not included into the RT totals "<br><br>The system for the voting % here on Rotten Tomatos a score of " 1/2 star " or " not interested " is not included into RT tracking system ??<br><br>I read that and wanted to make sure my vote is included so moved up from 1/2 a start to 1 star... still negative but I hope will add to the totals.<br><br>I see now it is 48% a move in the right direction but still not accurate.<br><br>This is a new low for me as a person. I am the sort of person that encourages people I give praise to people I try to motivate I try never to be a negative person or see anyone or anything in a bad light I dont put people down. But with this movie I am very happy to see it fall and I do hope the % falls much much lower so Kathllen Kennedy and Ryan Johnson get it through their heads that this is not a few..."butt hurt fans" crying the blues.... but the vast majority that cant stand this train wreck movie.<br><br>You people giving 5 star reviews with no explantions are funny. if your happy fooling yourself all the power to you but your not fooling anyone else. If you legitimately like this movie why cant you say anything beyond " wow great movie ! Best ever ! " Or some such nonsense why not list point by point what you liked fill us in as most of us obviously did not see what you did.<br><br>Wow.... <br><br>I saw a comment that indicated Ryan and Kathleen are belittle any person that does not " get the great wonderful message " that is in the movie. We are called "racists misogynists old and out of touch and 2 steps below retard " I suppose this would have validity if it was only "stupid old white angry women hating men" making comments and videos about this movie. If you take the time to see youtube videos you find young old asian black women men intelectuals and blue colar...all with a negative opinion. <br><br>All the people hating this movie do not fit into the same demographic. <br><br>Its actualy insulting.<br><br>What is the problem with Kathleen Kennedy and Ryan Johnson and Disney not coming forward to say " wow we made a mistake we fucked up we are so sorry" Shame on all of you for not letting go of your pride to do the honest thing and step forward and say you made a mistake. <br><br>Is it more honorable ...to try to pass the blame onto the fans and try to make them think there is something wrong with them for not loving this movie to death.<br><br>Thats about as twisted and narcissistic as it gets.<br><br>So the great messages in the movie that come to mind for me upon reflection are as follows.<br><br>Lets start with Luke. The great message is <br><br>" if you fail....abandon your family your friends everything you care about and ...run away and hide in shame..forever as a coward "<br><br>wow... great message.<br><br>Rey the great message here....<br><br>Everything should be easy you should not need education expierence or training you should be 100% perfect and get everything you want...... just because you are entitiled.<br><br>We need more people to feel they are owed everything? No more start at the bottom and work your way up? just start at the top ?<br><br>The casino planet message is...<br><br>"All weathy people are evil and can not be trusted..."<br><br>This is funny...I laughed when I thought about the idiocy of this part of the movie. Disney executives and Kathleen Kennedy make more money in one day than you and I  and likely 98% of the people reading this will make in 1 year. But they would have us think...they are not part of the wealthy elite..and thus...are not the bad people similar to the rich people portrayed in the movie ? <br><br>Give me a break.<br><br>Social messages horrible writting idiotic humor lazy character development. I found I could not care if any of the characters lived or died as I watched the movie...I was numb from the sheer stupidity.<br><br>How was this ever given a green light for approval on the script and for filming? I have no clue how it survivedthe edit process....I think i would have cut out 95% of the movie. I am at a loss it is so horrible and no one at disney picked up on it and said " oh..my god.... " and stoped it before it was released. The only thing " star wars" about this movie is its name.<br><br>It is all to obvious Disney and Kathleen Kennedy must have thought star wars fans are stupid and will buy into whatever shit they give to us because it is " star wars ". <br><br>Fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me.<br><br>Disney and Lucas films need to decide on some new leadership in regards to the direction of star wars. Because if this is the new way to do things the days of big money returns for anything star wars will be long long gone. <br><br>What a waste., 1.0,  Ted W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977044591/, January 29 2018,

 This film just as its predecessor continues to demonstrate that Disney does not understand what makes Star Wars one of the most beloved franchises in cinema history.<br><br>Disney has admitted that they did not write an overarching story for these new films. Apparently the directors are making it up as they go. Well let me tell you it really shows. From the poor writing to the cringe worthy humor to the overt political messages being shoved down the audience throat to the lack of basic character development to the numerous plot holes/contrivances or just the general lack of emotion/feeling in the story this film not only fails as a Star Wars film but as a film in general.<br><br>How this film/script was ever greenlit is beyond me. Disney should legitimately hold off on releasing any more SW's content until some major changes happen within the company. They need people in charge who understand SW and who are passionate about it. Additionally Disney needs to get the boardroom influence out of the creative process. Let the director writers and other contributors to these films breathe and create art (These films will print money regardless all that the corporate influence is doing is destroying the brand and driving away fans).<br><br>The Last Jedi is the worst SW movie by a landslide. I would rather sit in a room and watch the prequels on repeat than watch this horrendous film ever again., 1.0,  Keith F, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977042625/, January 29 2018,

 Incredibly long drawn out and boring. This movie is just filled with political propaganda and was basically just used as a stage for Disney the director and writers to push their political agenda on the audience. Awful plot filled with holes and way too many side stories that have nothing to do with anything. This movie makes the prequels look like cinematic gold DO NOT waste your time or money on this flaming pile of garbage that boils down to nothing more than a slap in the face to Star Wars fans.

 I went into this movie not knowing of the director change from The Force Awakens to The Last Jedi but it took probably 30 minutes until I realized something was way off. I am not a huge Star Wars "nerd" so it would be pretty easy to entertain me without let down much like TFA did. However this movie had me leaving the theaters very confused. What the F did I just watch was the main feeling. When I realized it wasn't JJ Abrams directing/writing I started investigating. Rian Johnson was apparently beat up by Jedi as a kid and this is his payback. Rian's attempt to create something NEW and different ended up with a mess of a movie. You can read all the other reviews they are not lying. ROSE sucks as a character and isn't so much as annoying as she is completely pointless. Finn sucks in this movie too and him and REY are not together at all. No point to their friendship/chemistry from TFA. He has a new GF now ROSE! Downgrade for sure. I had thought Rose was a lesbian whose lover died in the beginning. It was her sister I guess but who cares. Her sister had a more important role in the movie than her and she blew herself up in the first 5 minutes. I could go into almost every scene and critique it for being either stupid plot hole or it going against everything we saw in the original 3 or the last movie (Snoke Plasma Rey are all pointless I guess and Luke and Leia are both killing kids/space flying respectively) but I don't want this movie to waste anymore of my time.<br><br>1 star because I read RT doesn't count 1/2 stars. They are too busy buying off the "real" critics it seems., 1.0,  Cole E, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977079941/, January 29 2018, 
 For me this movie get a solid 8/10! Now it is definitely no masterpiece far FAR from perfect There are a lot of plot holes subplots from Force Awakens are dropped the comedy is so pointless and there's just moments in there and I was beginning to worry that it would get even worse but it didn't. It's true that The Last Jedi is full of problems but it has a lot of amazing things that make up for those flaws: Mark Hamill's performance is amazing a fitting send-off to Carrie Fisher Addresses flaws to the Jedi And The Rebellion It's Genuinely Unpredictable it has the best lightsaber fight i've seen in a long time and the best starship battle i' Seen in a long time it has Amazing Cinematography just the right amount of Porgs (those little chicken-Bird things aka they're so cute and adorable... and tastes like chicken) the message of hope is as relevant as ever and a rejection of Nostalgia! In the end there is a lot to enjoy in this movie and I could say a lot of bad things about it but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it in fact I liked it a lot. The CGI And the backgrounds are spot on and very beautiful to look at. The Last Jedi is one of the most beautiful looking Star Wars films i' Seen to date and not one that would appeal to all the fans which is why I say that the movie gets a 4 star rating (8/10)!, 4.0,  Micah%20 B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977080170/, January 29 2018,

 t is well shot and skillfully directed I will give Ryan J that much. In addition the performances are all good to superb. However if you are someone for whom the original trilogy was a defining aspect of your childhood or understand good filmmaking at a basic level I can't see how you can like this. It's not that the film is terrible it's worse than that it's just nothing. It's lifeless awkward politically correct and utterly vacuous. It doesn't say or do anything new or interesting and worse it eschews not only the established SW universe but even the majority of the plot lines established in the previous film.<br>I gues it is its a "fresh new direction" Like when we get to see the most hopeful and optimistic character in the SW universe literally the only one who saw good in Darth Vader and managed to turn him to the light sense darkness in Kylo so............. he contemplates murdering the child of his best friend and sister in his sleep then runs from the conflict and decides to become a hermit and shut himself off from the force taking up the milking of alien sea cows and pole vault spearfishing. One of the more loved secondary characters Admiral Ackbar was replaced by purple hair so that KK could have yet another strong woman and Ryan couldn't even get that right managing to have her inexplicably forget to mention her master plan to abandon ship and escape to the secret base so that we could have the secondary drama of Poe's Mutiny. Then there's "no airlock required" Mary Poppins Leia Machine Gun BB-8 who can also apparently tie up security guards off camera the 45 min of pointless casino planet it truly is a hot mess. What a shame that this is the direction KK has allowed the franchise to take. Any one of a hundred EU novels or even some fan fiction would have been better than this garbage. Disney - you have unlimited resources - Put talented writers take control of the overall story progression and stop allowing kids who don't understand star wars from taking the series in any more "fresh" and "bold" new directions., 1.0,  Strong B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/928578635/, January 29 2018, 
 All of the grandeur all of the emotion all of the gravitas seen in the original Star Wars trilogy is conspicuously absent here:<br><br>The worst Star Wars film (so far).<br><br>When I heard this film was 2.5 hours long I was thrilled at the thought of all of the great things it would bring. But it brought nothing positive at all.<br><br>The story set up in The Force Awakens has been ignored mostly or its been treated in a really negative and subversive way.<br><br>It leaves no investment for Episode 9. None. And this is allegedly part 2 of a trilogy.

 How did this screenplay even make it past the editing table?

 This has the superficial appearance of a Star Wars film but lacks any plot character growth tension and has annoying characters that do things that do not make any sense. Sadly this film should have been much better give the wealth of source material and the legion of fans who care about the series. It succeeds in cutting itself off from the Star Wars that we know. Why it's called episode 8 is beyond me. I guess the plan is now to have an endless pararade of films called Star Wars for the sake of making money and trying to be politically correct. The professional critics who rate so highly this film should be ashamed., 1.5,  Aloke D, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/964158919/, January 29 2018, 
 SOME SPOILERS. This movie while having some problems with tone and pacing doesn't deserve the level of vitriol being thrown against it. Admittedly I understand. For awhile I was right there with everyone who is posting negative reviews. I even created an account and rated it low. Like Mark Hamill I initially fundamentally disagreed with the direction that took Luke's character. But then I saw it again and like Hamill I appreciated the nuance and development that was expressed. It took a second viewing to understand what this movie did right and what it was trying to do. This comes from a life long Star Wars fan. I feel bad that I initially trashed it. Watch it again and your perception may change. As I said I disagree with some of the pacing and storyline decisions (purple hair Canto Bight some politicizing and Rose saving Finn I am looking at you) but this movie actually does a lot of things right and cleans the slate for the Star Wars universe to go in any direction. We don't have a Vader clone in Kylo Ren we don't have a carbon copy Palaptine. We have a Skywalker that is a supreme commander and lowly woman from a backwater planet with no special lineage as the one standing against someone from a powerful bloodline. We have probably the best pilot we have seen in a Star Wars movie in Poe Dameron who is not an Antilles/Solo copy who goes from brash hothead to capable leader. We have an immensely outgunned resistance in a small "ark" trying to carry the light of hope. Sure there were issues. There are always issues in Star Wars movies and anyone that says otherwise is looking through rose-colored glasses. This was the most nuanced and deep Star Wars movie that has been released and when the dust settles and tempers calm may go down as being on par with Empire in the future.<br><br>**UPDATED for correction and added a comment about Poe Dameron. And speaking of Poe Dameron I would like to offer a rebuttal against some of the criticisms suggesting that the Last Jedi was merely a feminist hit piece against masculinity. Although I understand how someone can try to make that claim bear in mind that  toward the end of movie Leia when asked for guidance by the surviving resistance points to Poe and says "follow him". I don't believe that this was an attack on masculinity but a lesson on wisdom versus recklessness and what it takes to be a leader. Remember that in Return of the Jedi Yoda had the same lesson for Luke ("You are reckless"). He wasn't attacking Luke's masculinity but his immaturity. This lesson whether it comes form a female character or a little green puppet is a timeless one. Please bear in mind that the female characters are not perfect either. Rey while accused of being a mary sue with no character flaws screws up in a big way by not heeding Luke's advice and recklessly flying off like he did in ROTJ.<br><br>LAST UPDATE. Let's talk about Luke since this seems to be one of the main reasons that people are disliking the movie. As I said above initially I was right there with everyone. I thought they utterly screwed up his character and I was pissed. So pissed in fact that I made account on review sites trashed the move and signed a dumb petition. But I was wrong. Think about it this way.. Who hasn't contemplated what they would do if they could go back in time and kill Hitler before he rose to power. That's the dilema that Luke was facing. It's not as some suggest that he sensed a little bit of darkness in Ben and decided to go full-on murder spree. Yes. This is the man who sacrificed everything to save his father. This is the man who for the duration of the OT trusted his instincts (They "served him well"). In that moment he saw what Kylo would become. A tyrant that would undo everything that he and his friends fought and lost so much for. Someone that could plunge the galaxy into a new dictatorship killing millions and bringing darkness. For one second his instincts told him to strike him down. But you know what? This is a wiser Luke still human and flawed but someone who now knows that following "feelings" isn't always the best course of action. You need wisdom and patience. He might have thought about it for one second but that second passes. Is this really out of character or does it show a very nuanced character growth? For me after thinking it through it shows the latter.<br><br>Some people had a problem with him not showing up in person to defend the resistance against the First Order. First I don't think he could his X-wing seemed to be beyond repair at the point but more importantly what he did reflected the wisdom of a Jedi Master. If he showed up one of two things would have happened. He would have either killed Kylo Ren robbing him of any redemption or he would have been struck down robbing the resistance of any remaining hope that they had. By projecting himself across the galaxy he not only showed himself to be the most powerful force user that we have ever seen he also became something more than a man. He became a symbol and a legendary hero. Is that really a bad way to end Luke's journey?<br><br>For the record and for full disclosure. I am a conservative and while I do feel that there was some politicizing going on in the Canto Bight sequence I would suggest you can also look at it from another perspective. Rather than being an "anti-capitalist" hit piece you can also view it has a commentary on immoral individuals playing both sides of a conflict rather than making a stand for freedom against tyranny (selling weapons to both factions). I still think the sequence was a bit preachy and unnecessary and slowed the pacing of the movie., 4.5,  Steven S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977044800/, January 29 2018, 
 The diverging plots felt sloppy and uncoordinated the humor forced and the political messaging heavy-handed. It makes up rules as it goes along without explanation so that you more often end up asking "Wait what?" than go "Wow that's interesting." This isn't because people can't handle new revelations about how the universe works. It's because in this movie they aren't revelations they're just big dramatic plot devices. The end leaves you with no excitement for episode 9 as things seem to be unfolding at random. Overall Last Jedi is a flashy fast-paced mess that feels like a product not a story., 2.0,  Jay A, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977080092/, January 29 2018, 
 A movie of missed opportunities lot of plot holes inconsistent sacrifice of key characters of the original trilogy without meaning no hero-arch for the new main character. I didn't like TFA but at least JJ Abrams did set up elements to promote the storyline in the next episodes. Rian Johnson screw over this. To sum this up in two words: BAD WRITING. Transformers 3 has better storyline than this. I have no interest in 9 or Solo movies., 2.5,  Savvas P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977080012/, January 29 2018,

 Star Wars the Last Jedi is THE worse Star Wars film (Yes. Worse than The Phantom Menace).<br><br>All Star Wars movies are flawed. New Hope had Storm Troopers bumping their heads. The prequels had bad acting and midichlorians. None of these things in of themselves made these movies unwatchable.<br><br>I will never re-watch Last Jedi.....Go see Jumanji.<br><br>Last Jedi was not a Star Wars movie. Some fans seem to appreciate this - it was so different. It was an Rian Johnson masturbatory movie that happened to be set in the Star Wars universe. It was a Rian Johnson screw you to the true fans.<br><br>If you love ill-placed comedy that takes you of dramatic scenes well this is your movie.<br><br>If you love shocking contrived M Night Shyamalyan moments every 15 minutes then go see this movie.<br><br>If you like flying Jedi. Go see this film.<br><br>Otherwise the bewildering dumb main plot will insult your intelligence.<br>The way Luke is treated will anger you.<br>The socially motivated casino side adventure that seems to take up half the film and ultimately serves no point to the overall plot will bore you. (Go get popcorn here).<br>Unanswered questions created in Force Awakens will not be answered and the director doesn't seem to be aware that movie ever happened.<br>Empty characters like Rey and Finn literally develop news skills with no training or explanation.<br><br>Do not see this poorly directed and poorly written film.

 I agree with almost every negative complaint that has been said about this movie. <br><br>Hollywood has forgotten how to tell stories that are meaningful and inspiring and have replaced it with diversity quotas leftist/sjw political themes and abolishing the heart of the original Star Wars universe. Absolute trash. This film is not cannon. <br><br>Also there are some sketching things going on with how this film is covered. Large format media outlets paint the film backlash as a small minority. I don't believe this to be true after reading reviews and general audience response. Who are these people who think the film is good? I haven't met them. The "small minority" is near everyone. I wouldn't be surprised if the rotten tomato audience rating drops below 30% in time. <br><br>This isn't just a bad film it undoes everything episides 1-7 have established.

 while it isn't a complete remake like the force awakens was it still takes a lot of major story elements from empire strikes back and return of the Jedi. it has the same basic concept as empire. you have the protagonist (Luke/Rey) being trained to use the force by an ancient Jedi master (Yoda/Luke) in an isolated area separated from the rest of the group (the rebellion/the resistance) who are fleeing from the enemy force (the empire/the first order) throughout the film. you also have a romance subplot (Han and Leia/Finn and Rose) a character who briefly helps them but then betrays them (Lando/DJ) and the protagonist learning something terrible about their parentage. as for return of the Jedi you have the protagonist thinking that the antagonist (darth Vader/Kylo Ren) can be redeemed but their masters tell them that they cannot be turned. they don't listen and get themselves captured and try to talk the antagonist into turning good to which they are conflicted but don't quite give in. they take the protagonist to their masters (the emperor/Snoke) who taunts them about how their apprentice will not be turned and how their friends will be destroyed. they order their apprentice to kill the protagonist but they turn against them and kills them instead. you also have a scene where the ancient Jedi master dies and becomes one with the force. so the film gets points off for it's unoriginality. but it does have an original theme which is about learning from your mistakes and letting go of the past. this theme is fresh and interesting. Rey is at least given a bit more character than she did in the force awakens as she has to learn to accept the fact that her parents are gone for good. this is a good character moment for her. but this is only one scene and it should have been focused on more and she does still ultimately feel like a Mary-Sue. I have mixed feelings about how Luke was portrayed. on one hand the fact that a character who once refused to give up on the second most evil man in the galaxy and succeeded to redeem him would now resort to killing the son of two of his best friends who hasn't even fully turned yet feels very out of character. but on the other hand his general ark is really good. I really like the idea of a broken Luke learning to face his past. Kylo Ren is actually significantly improved on here. while in the force awakens he often came off as a whiny emo teenager I actually took him fully seriously this time around. he was a conflicted complex and sympathetic antagonist and brought a lot to this film. Snoke was probably always meant to be a one note character. but the fact that they would do this to such an intimidating immensely powerful character is somewhat disappointing. but for the little screen time he got he was as badass as you would hope. Phasma is also wasted just as much as she was in the force awakens. Hux does what he needs to fine but I find him to be a bit to over the top and hammy. Poe is actually given more attention here and he has a decent ark which I enjoyed. Leia doesn't do a whole lot which is fine. but there's this scene where she almost dies out in space but she uses the force to fly to safety. she flies almost like superman. and while I kind of like the idea of her using the force the way it plays out is just really weird and it doesn't work. there is a new character named Holdo who just feels pointless and her plot line doesn't make sense. why didn't she just tell everyone about her plan instead of keeping it secret for no reason? there is a subplot involving Finn and a new Character named Rose going to find a code breaker. this feels pointless and forces in an overly preachy message about saving animals that this film didn't need at all. also their chemistry is extremely forced and Rose's character is not compelling in the slightest. but although pointless the code breaker character named DJ is something of an entertaining presence. the ports are fine. they're not particularly amusing but they're not in the film enough to become irritating. they're tolerable. something that bothered me is that this film drops several things set up in the force awakens such as Rey's vision Kylo Ren's further training and the knights are Ren. also Han Solo's death is brought up once and then forgotten and Rey is promised three lessons and is only given two. there is quite a bit of comedy in this film. on one hand a lot of the jokes did make me laugh. but a lot of them felt forced and out of place and there is to much of it. visually this is probably the best Star Wars movie. the cinematography and locations are gorgeous to look at and the action sequences are quite impressive. the score by John Williams is great as always. overall this film is a huge mixed bag. it's an improvement over it's underwhelming predecessor the force awakens but still ultimately a disappointment., 2.5,  Shane J, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977079927/, January 29 2018, 
 Wow where do I begin.. Take the entire series Wad it up and throw it in the trash. It is that bad. Poor character development Poor tactics Absolutely plot less story. Quite obvious that the critics companies are getting bought by Disney too. The characters are shallow. The Tactics in battles are absolutely not researched. There are powers that just are inconceivable. All of the character development we saw in the last movie was just thrown out the window in favor of some sort of Social Statement. This was horrible.

 Literally the very first thing you see on the screen in every Star Wars episode are the words "A long time ago in a galaxy far far away...." So why is the film loaded with topical "humor" and infected with 21st century earth feminist/social justice propaganda? This is supposed to be entertainment isn't it? <br><br>Leftists do not want any "safe spaces" from their propaganda. From Obama urging people to talk about his healthcare plan at the Thanksgiving dinner table to Starbucks attempting to make buying an overpriced coffee an "opportunity to talk about race" to the NFL kneelers and Hollywood awards shows becoming unapologetic Democrat Party tent revivals there is no rest from their propagandizing.

 Post modernist social justice propaganda garbage. Hey do you like star wars? Not anymore The feminist war machine has ruined it just like Marvel and everything else they touch. Do you like strong heroic characters and powerful intimidating bad guys? Sorry we don't have any of those either. We do however have some weak broken men who are either incapable of any type of confidence and leadership or are so sad and defeated they just want to hide in their tree house and pout. We do have some strong women! oh no wait there just as sad and pathetic as they try and fail miserably to be just like men so sad. Where's young princess Leia? Now that's how you do a bad ass female character. Feminine enough to rock a metal bikini while choking the god loving S#%T out of one of the most powerful crime lords in the galaxy. Have you seen the size of Jabba's neck? she's no one to mess with. <br><br> Finally and this is the best part after your done knee jerking and cringing at all the embarrassing pro(re)gressive indoctrination that flies in the face of everything that is attractive desirable and respected by normal humans you get to listen to the communist virtue signaling media chastise you for having your own opinion and claiming it's the greatest star wars movie ever and you are a shamefull racist bigoted pig if you disagree.

 The Last Jedi was 2 1/2 hours of missed opportunities. Rian Johnson has effectively ruined the Skywalker legacy and crippled the Sequel Trilogy due to his 'bold' and 'unexpected' choices for Episode VIII...to the point I doubt JJ can save it with IX. Sadly I refuse to watch any film in Johnson's new trilogy because of how offensive this movie is. For all of it's faults and criticisms of being derivative The Force Awakens was exciting fun and introduced enough new elements that set up the Sequel Trilogy brilliantly. All Johnson had to do was carry it through to a satisfying middle act. Yet he throws it all (and I mean ALL) away and what he delivers is a terribly disjointed mess that dishonors just about every major character the 7 films which preceded it and the mythology of the Force itself. This middle chapter feels like the middle finger. When the star of your film says "'I pretty much fundamentally disagree with every choice you've made for this character"...maybe you should have listened and listened closely Johnson. When The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones have higher audience scores than your film (no matter how Disney and the press wish to spin it) you've made a major misstep. I don't hate the prequels nor do I demonize George Lucas. The Prequel Trilogy is far from perfect but it is imaginative and fun and tells the backstory George had envisioned since the '70s. Each episode builds on the previous one (as it should). As I watched The Last Jedi I kept wondering if Johnson had actually seen The Force Awakens. And the character assassination of Luke Skywalker is simply unforgivable. History will not be kind to this film and many die-hard fans will rue the day Disney threw out Lucas' original treatments (if they don't already). I miss you George I really do. Help us JJ you are our only hope. <br><br>(And no Disney I'm not a bot a troll a Russian a hack a Hobbit a Muppet or anything else your marketing campaign has to say about fans who didn't like this film)., 1.0,  Jeff R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/920026470/, January 29 2018,

 RIP Star Wars (1977-2017). For forty years you dazzled and amazed fans of all ages. We stuck with you through Jar Jar Binks and other misfires always knowing that you had the best intentions at heart. Then Rian Johnson came along and decided to kill the past and all that Star Wars meant along with it. <br><br>Make no mistake it wasn't theorizing fanboys with unrealistic expectations misogynists or racists that did the deed. It was a horrible script written by Rian "I wouldn't change a thing" Johnson that did the deed. A script that ignored all that came before it even tossing aside numerous plot threads left to follow by the immediate predecessor in an egotistical effort to make something "unexpected". Bravo - you squeezed out a turd Mr. Johnson. <br><br>To be fair Rian doesn't deserve all the blame. Somehow other people at Lucasfilm and Disney read that script and actually approved it (none of them apparently realizing that the slow chase and casino stop were not unique having already been done much better in either the original or remake of Battlestar Galactica). <br><br>In any event given the results I will follow Rian's advice and let the past die. With it goes my undying love for and loyalty to Star Wars. I suspect there may be a widespread similar reaction from much of the fandom. <br><br>Like many others my one star goes to the one remaining piece of the Star Wars legacy: John Williams., 1.0,  DangerMouse R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977079768/, January 29 2018,

 This will be my final review of Star Wars: The Last Jedi having seen it for a second time. It is the middle film of the third Star Wars trilogy. This trilogy along with some anthology films are being made because Disney bought LucasFilm in 2012.<br><br><br><br>There is something special about seeing these movies a second time because generally what happens is that any flaws that might exist become less noticeable or at least easier to ignore. In addition you notice new things with each viewing. This was definitely true for watching Star Wars: The Force Awakens which had a few problems not the least of which was that the story was somewhat a remake of the original Star Wars film and the movie is so stingy in providing the audience with information that it made it feel like it was full of plot holes. The other major complaint was that the main character Rey was so talented in everything that it made her feel like a "Mary Sue" which is a character that is so perfect in everything that the character becomes annoying or unbelievable. However especially on my third viewing of the film I began to understand Star Wars: The Force Awakens better and really appreciate what they were trying to do even if it did have a few flaws.<br><br><br><br>Whereas Star Wars: The Force Awakens in many ways copies the original film A New Hope the new movie contains some elements similar to both The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Having already copied many things from the entire first trilogy the next movie might have to do something completely different.<br><br><br><br>After seeing Star Wars: The Last Jedi two weeks ago I watched videos on youtube everyday where people complain about different aspects of this film. A large number of people actually hate this movie but these are usually the die hard fans who feel the movie strayed too far from its roots by slightly changing the Star Wars mythology. Plus the new film like its predecessor still has some plot holes. Furthermore even though people were counting on it to fill in information missing from the previous movie it only provides enough information so that audience can follow along. There are questions that we may never get an answer to such as the origin of Snoke although it has been hinted that some of these questions may be answered in upcoming Star Wars books which is an annoyingly clever form of marketing by Disney and Lucasfilm to get you to buy books.<br><br><br><br>There were three other major complaints about this film. The first is in the way the character Luke Skywalker is handled because he is no longer a hero. After experiencing a major setback Luke abandons his friends the rebellion the Jedi Order and The Force. Even the actor Mark Hamill repeatedly complained about this. The second complaint is that many people feel like the movie is hitting us over the head with Social Justice Warrior messages which seems pretty obvious when watching it. The third complaint is that movie has too many moments of levity. It is not a comedy but it really pushes the humor most of which works but some of it falls flat.<br><br><br><br>There has been a kind of backlash. The Rotten Tomatoes Critics Score is 91% down from an initial 93% but the audience score is only 52%. That's a huge difference between critics and audience although there has been some debate on how accurate the audience score is on Rotten Tomatoes. More importantly ticket sales are way down.<br><br><br><br>Given all the negativity I about convinced myself Star Wars: The Last Jedi might not be worth a second viewing despite feeling thoroughly entertained and emotionally moved the first time around. I was worried that the flaws would stick out too much.<br><br><br><br>I have never been so happy to be wrong. Sure the film has a few flaws as many movies do but the second time around is still very entertaining and emotionally moving. This drowns out any plot holes political agendas being pushed or confusion the movie has caused the audience about the characters.<br><br><br><br>The one thing that the film does well is defy all audience expectations and that makes it more entertaining. At one point Luke says to Rey "This is not going to go the way you think." Well that describes the entire movie which is maybe why some people have a problem with it. To some extent it breaks the mold of what a Star Wars movie could or should be but the result is kind of special. It is also rich in texture I noticed way more things on the second viewing. There is so much that happens that goes by very quickly.<br><br><br><br>The movie is a fitting send off for the late Carrie Fisher. Although she does not have a ton of screen time it is enough and her performance is more interesting than in the previous movie. Her daughter Billie Lourd also has a more active role in this film. The end credits have this dedication:<br><br><br><br>In loving memory of our princess<br><br>Carrie Fisher.<br><br><br><br>The movie could have ended one minute sooner than it did but the final scene is like a bonus involving a young boy we saw earlier in the movie. This scene is magical but you can see the Disney influence in it.<br><br><br><br>Although Star Wars: The Last Jedi may stray a little from its Star Wars roots every time it quickly returns to it roots making it feel like a pretty good Star Wars film. As a die hard Star Wars fan the movie very much appeals to me but it seems also to have been designed to appeal to a much wider audience and not just the Star Wars fanatics. As such it is a very entertaining movie but there are some noticeable flaws. For this reason I can't give it four stars but three and a half just isn't enough to describe how much I like this movie.<br><br><br><br>Rating: 3.75 out of 4.<br><br><br><br>P.S.

 Someone said that half and zero stars don't count in the average so I'm changing to 1 star. Believe me it doesn't deserve it this is a ZERO star movie beginning with the phony phone call to Hux and ending with Luke dying from exhaustion.<br><br>Seeing this movie can really ruin everything Star Wars for you including the Original Trilogy. I urge you to not see it if possible you will be better off. It's all been said before but here are a couple of examples:<br>1) Luke was turned into a disheveled bum and also an attempted child murderer who (for a second) planned to kill his nephew (who had done nothing wrong) in his sleep then later dies of exhaustion. Not kidding here.<br>2) Leia uses her first force powers to fly through space like Superman. Again I'm not kidding.<br>3)Dumb jokes bad slapstick and endless plot holes. Just sooooo bad!<br>4)Ignores undoes or contradicts everything in Force Awakens. For example 90% of Force Awakens is about a map to find Luke. If Luke didn't want to be found and went to the island to die (sickening idea in its own right) why did he make a map and also give R2 a missing part of it? Did A-hole Rian Johnson even watch Force Awakens once?<br><br>Well like most train wrecks its hard to look away so I expect most will see it.

 This movie did something I didn't think possible. It made me wish George Lucas were still in control of his property. I wish I could say I loved this and it was a great step forward but the story and the writing are so bad it's hard to look past. I love this franchise I go to the celebrations I collect the collectibles I watch and rewatch. But this is a terrible installment that robs me of all enthusiasm to see Episode IX. It simultaneously lowers my faith that Rian Johnson getting his own Star Wars trilogy is a good thing.

 This movie is horrifyingly awful. Below is a synopsis of the movie. I am including spoilers so that anyone who doesn't want to line Disney's pockets anymore can skip the movie and catch it later on Netflix.<br><br>There's a painfully slow sub-light space chase where we must believe that an Imperial fleet that can exceed the speed of light can't think of a way to catch a single ever-so-slightly-faster rebel cruiser In space where there's no gravity bombs fall out of ships as though they were WW2 bombers Leia gets ejected into space and comes back to life and travels Mary Poppins-like to knock on the door to be let back in Kylo Ren hates his helmet now The Empire needs a huge complicated device to track ships across the galaxy but Leia and Rey can use a wristwatch to do the same thing there's an entire sub-plot to locate a mysterious code-breaker which was completely pointless Jedi can now make their visage appear anywhere in the universe and scare people Wookies live forever Rey's parents were worthless drunks Jedi masters can come back to life any time they want Adam Driver has nipples Poe Dameron is personally responsible in 2 separate incidents for the deaths of thousands of his fellow rebels but is still a hero Benicio Del Toro's stuttering character is unsympathetic because he immediately sells out the entire resistance Rose sets the casino horses free but leaves the casino human children imprisoned Snoke dies but we get no explanation for who he was or how he got here The guy who could freeze laser blasts in mid-air while simultaneously putting force chokes on people in Episode 7 gets put in a physical chokehold by a red-suit dude and has to be rescued Laura Dern drives her spaceship at light speed through a bad guy ship and kills thousands of bad guys but the 3 good guys are all uninjured Rey can now force lift gigantic boulders even though she has had only one 5-minute Jedi lesson Luke dies (or does he?) the end., 1.0,  John B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977027620/, January 29 2018,

 Redoing review due to half star supposedly not counting. Nothing else can be said other than it appears this is some type of parody of Star Wars. Rian Johnson apparent ineptness is staggering. I'm leaning though he is a patsy and was basically told what to put in the film and I would expect the new Han Solo to be in the same boat. Axed two directors for creative differences and pulled someone in who would do the mouses bidding. Probably why we haven't seen a trailer yet.<br><br>So about this abomination. Many people will say it's because too many women and SJW etc...it's really not that. Rogue one and TFA was pretty diverse and even though TFA was a rehash of ANH it was still Star Wars and made you made feel good. The problem with TLJ is it is just a terrible movie pure and simple. The movie is just terrible. It's a movie you would expect to see on SyFy at 3am right after Sharknado 3 oh hell no. I'm not joking it's really that bad. It's a complete travesty and utter abomination of the Star Wars lore/history/canon. It almost feels like it was completely done on purpose for some weird reason. I can't think of how any sane individuals could make it through watching the cuts or ven the storyboard and go YES! That's our block buster! This is the rich new direction of the Star Wars universe. This movie is so bad.<br><br>What really aggravates me is the trailer looks so good. It's this constant hoodwinking pulling the rug out from underneath you that's irritating as well. At every turn in the film the rug is pulled out from under you or another thing I love is every detail in the scene is pointed out and over explained. Like Rose looking in the escape pod and seeing finns bag and she's seen others escaping and they she puts two and two together ( verbally ) and my god it's awful. Like beavis noticing the tv was stolen in beavis and butthead do America in which it works in that movie because it's a movie about morons. <br><br>To slightly touch on the SJW front it's ok to have kick ass women and kick ass men share the screen. One doesn't haven't to belittle the other to make the point the woman is strong. Just be cool and make them both kick ass. It's ok we can all get all along no matter how much we say we can't we will<br><br>I won't go over the destruction of Luke. It's freaking lousy and actually I think pushing an agenda which makes me sick<br><br>Chewbaca Kathleen Kennedy watch a Star Wars film and understand Luke can understand Chewie we know Rey can do everything including interrupting but the previous movies show Chewie and Luke communicating. One of the biggest critiques of the movie was lack of extortion towards any character due to non existent character development. One spot that should have been obvious would have been to have Chewie explain to Luke Hans demise. Remember when Chewie threw storm troopers in ESB when Han was going into carbonite? Remember him howling and shooting Kylo and not wasting any time blowing the hell out of Star killer base when Kylo killed Han. If you watch the previous movies you can tell Han and Chewie were pretty good friends and the obvious thing was to have Chewie do it. Seriously aggravates me you spend 200 million on this load of crap and obvious things like this are messed up. You have no direction. It's silly.<br><br>I could talk about Rey all day. A true Mary Sue and it doesn't work. You missed it here. Her being so good at everything was hinged on this second movie and now that even ruin johnson has come out and said it was a creative decision to make her no one special. Lol seriously. I have watched every movie in the theatre. Every since EP1 I've camped out and waited in line took vacation etc. watch them at least 10x in the theaters. Not this one and not another one. I'm so over Star Wars at this point. The decisions in TLJ have made it to where it unrecoverable. Nothing can be done to unscrew this. I couldn't care less what happens to anyone in the film. I don't care about the resistance I don't care about Rey or the insufferable Kylo ren. Kylo is one hell of an actor. Kylo changed his mood every scene in the film. Adam driver is an all star too bad he isn't being used the way he should be.<br><br>I won't go on any more than this about this terrible movie. Kathleen Kennedy and Ruin Johnson. You will go down in history for ruining Star Wars. Think about that. Seriously congrats. This isn't Xmas with the kranks or home alone. Lmfao you took Star Wars and destroyed it!! bwahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha. Seriously<br> at the time of this rating you're sitting on a forty nine percent audience rating. And that's with people high fivng it for money. It should be around thirty five or so I wouldsay is fair.

 The second I found out Disney took over Star Wars I knew Star Wars was doomed. I knew it would turn into a pitch for girl power and diversity. Leia slapping a man? What if a man slapped a woman!!!? In addition I knew Disney would make Star Wars all flash and no substance. Substance to me is what makes Star Wars what it is. Star Wars was so deep with philosophy etc. that it leaves things subjective and open to interpretation. And to me that interpretation gives the viewer his/her own sense of what Star Wars is and can make it his/her own.<br><br>Anyway imagine if Disney stuck to the Star Wars script and for instance made Luke Skywalker the hero we all remember him to be. This movie could have easily topped one billion domestic. I hope you enjoy all the billions of dollars you're going to lose out on now Disney! You sold out Star Wars to appeal to nothing but women and SJW's and admit doing so isn't that right Rian Johnson? Funny how Rian Johnson is getting so defensive over his "work". Deep down you're admitting your guilt that you're an atrocity to the big screen.<br><br>As for all the professional "critics"... why don't you all grow a pair and tell us how you really feel. You all are too afraid to write a negative review? Take Disney's metaphorical dick out of your mouths and assholes and do your job. As for the critics who gave it a negative review we love you and appreciate you and we'll do our best to make sure you're always revered!<br><br>Oh and one more thing Rian. Stop acting like you're a genius. I know you are losing sleep and officially on medication since you know the entire world loathes you and thinks you're worthless. Loved your article Rian about how you couldn't wait to see the audiences reaction to the Canto Bight scene because you thought it was a masterpiece. Yeah I think us Star Wars fans have deemed that scene the most worthless scene of all time that has nothing to do with the movie. Stop deflecting Rian Johnson. You're done.

 Why this movie is dangerous for the true feminists and women in general.<br>In retrospective after watching this movie we have the possibility to try to understand why Daisy Ridley was casted for playing Rey the first female jedi hero (if we don't count Princess Leia who admittedly never shown to be aware of any force powers until she actually became Mary Poppins in The Last Jedi).<br>First of all let's take a look at her phisical appearance while outside the movie sets: gorgeous makeup long flowing hair generous miniskirts which let us actually see her nice legs open shoes with stilettoes low-cut shirts flashing/bright coloured dresses and shoes. In other words: a woman as we normally see them around. A woman who is not afraid to be a woman and to appeal also sexually the males and the women who watch her. A "normal" woman may I add.<br>Let's take a look at her phisical appearance in the SW movies: her naturally small breasts small hips and butt are further removed from everyone's sight through the use of very tight dresses which never fail to cover her erogenous zones. She does not sport a single trace of makeup. Her hair is tied up. In other word a chastized and de-sexualized de-feminized version of a woman.<br>What is the message that Disney or better Kathleen Kennedy wants to convey here?<br>Are they aware that they are basically saying to all women: "Look if you want to rule the world you have to dress like a man act like a man hide the physical evidence that you are not a man in other words you have to be a man".<br>How bad a role model is that?<br>Look at what Warner Bros did with Wonder Woman. Gal Gadot is a real woman (with ample breasts and hips flowing hair and gorgeous makeup) and she has been casted for playing Diana Prince a very strong and powerful woman in whom almost every other woman in the world can easily identify (and project) herself and who is not afraid at all of showing the world that she is a woman.<br>In the movie her breasts are evidenced not hidden by her costume. Her legs and feet too. And still she succeeds in portraying the most bad-ass female in the universe.<br>Sex appeal is just one of her powers. A very special power indeed since all other women in the world have it.<br>Rey has plenty of force powers. Unfortunately she does not have a bit of sex appeal and she has completely renounced her femininity which would have added some depth to her paper thin character. She barely resembles a woman. Why should women identify with her? Why should men feel attracted by her?<br>Really Disney you got confused. Sex is not the enemy and de-sexualizing every character will not lure men and women into the theaters., 1.0,  Carlos B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977079570/, January 29 2018,

 Far better than what I expected. Elements of a really great Star Wars film and some truly great moments make up for somewhat contrived plot (the ship chase seemed like a plot device) and perhaps unnecessary length. Most impressed with Mark Hamill he did a great job with what he was given. I really don't understand all the negative audience reviews overall a very good film with incredible effects and great sound track. The director took some risks and the end result is a worthy addition to the saga even if the film upset some people by doing the unexpected eg. Luke being conflicted. The story may have been more complex less black and white than what some fans were expecting but The Last Jedi is a very solid and entertaining ride start to finish highly recommended., 4.5,  Jarjar B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977079546/, January 29 2018,

 Movie was good. Many unexpected things happened. Some so-called hardcore fans didn't like the movie because they're theories about it we're wrong. It didn't go in the direction they thought it should so that equaled bad reviews. I too was wrong about what was gonna happen. However if you're going to review based on failed theories then don't review it. Take the movie for what it was. It had good acting good visuals and the story was a good continuation of this 3rd saga. I'm sure opinions of this movie will change for some when Episode IX comes out.

 The Last Jedi completely destroyed the basic storytelling technique of a hero's journey inspired by Joseph Campbell in the original Star Wars and pre-sequels. The Last Jedi threw out the basic stages which a hero or heroine must undergo to overcome challenges and gain self-awareness for the greater good. The original Star Wars' themes of loyalty to friends and mentors the struggle to gain self-awareness the struggle between good vs. evil and the redemption of an evil father are powerful themes found in a hero's journey. <br><br>The Last Jedi was a muddle-ridden plot with characters I no longer care about and can even remember their names. There was an opportunity for the new characters to carry forward the torch with their own unique journeys but instead the audience has to endure the horrible send-off of Luke and his legacy. Also thrown-out was the concept that insight and wisdom are gained from understanding the past and learning from wise mentors and teachers. <br><br>According to this movie you might as well destroy museums historical accounts mythology and legends literature and archaeological findings because it is no longer relevant to the present. What a misconception because the same basic issues keep repeating throughout history. That is why mythology has stood the test of time because it provides guidance and lessons to future generations who struggle to find their destiny. The movie completely lost sight of this.

 I love Star Wars but this movie just makes no sense. It is so full of plot holes that the Star Wars faithful (myself included) are in complete turmoil. There is no rational explanation for the story. We don't understand much of what happened and how it came about. <br><br>This turmoil has been blamed on sexism due to the many female lead roles but that accusation is a distraction. Using men in the roles wouldn't have fixed the real problem -- the numerous plot failures. <br><br>As the movie ends in complete tragedy all the good guys still alive have smiles on their faces in complete denial of how badly they failed.

 Even ignoring the destruction of the original trilogy characters it was just a bad movie. It jumped from one plot hole to the next with a sloppy frenzy.

Hell they even put an end to it when the 1D characters started to get some depth. Can't have that happen. Rey Finn Poe - wasted opportunities.<br><br>It looked pretty and had lots of action.

 I don't hate all the things that I understand other viewers detested about this film. I don't particularly care about the weird milk sloth monsters although I find it to be a strange choice by the director to include it. Further I don't mind the angry emo teenager character that Adam Driver portrayed. In fact I rather think he's one of the best things about these new movies. My concerns generally have to do with poor storytelling. I was struck throughout the film that the plot was not the natural outcome of the characters desires and subsequent motivated actions. Rather it seemed that the different plot points were chosen and then the characters were forced to do ridiculous things to get to those points.<br><br>The most egregious example of this was the decision by Laura Dern's character Vice Admiral Holdo to refrain from explaining to most of the people under her command what her plan was. I understand some viewers are saying that she had to keep quiet about it in order to ensure that the First Order would not become apprised of the plan fearing that there might have been a spy on board the ship. But given that the First Order was obviously trying to murder everyone aboard the ship it would have had to have been a very loyal spy indeed who was willing to die with the Resistance on the off chance that he or she might be able to come up with one last bit of useful intelligence. Even if this were a legitimate concern certainly she could have told Po about her plan considering that he had just personally destroyed the First Order's massive super weapon in the previous movie and their Dreadnought in this one. There was no way he was a spy. There were other minor infractions like the need for rebel commanders to die while still piloting their ships as if auto pilot a droid or a brick and some rope couldn't keep the vessels flying in a straight line for the last few seconds before they were destroyed by the first order. I believe these rebel commanders had to sacrifice themselves just to set up the idea that Holdo had to stay on board the cruiser in order that she might be there to use it to ram the pursuing fleet.<br><br>Some of the other plot choices that were made in this movie had more to do with ignoring established rules of physics in the Star Wars universe or creating new rules that didn't make sense. An example of the latter was Holdo's using the Resistance's abandoned cruiser to ram the First Order fleet. There is nothing wrong with saying that a ship can be used as a hyperspeed ram to destroy another ship. It's a science fiction universe: you can say the physics are whatever you want. However this was a new rule that didn't make any sense in the context of all the other movies. If you could just ram a ship to destroy it how is it that the rebels didn't just send empty cruisers on suicide missions to destroy fleets of Imperial destroyers during the battle of Hoth? Why wasn't there a large ship full of rocks launched at the Death Star? If this was a thing (and apparently from the reaction of the First Order's commanders when they say Holdo bringing her ship about to ram them not only was it a thing but EVERYONE KNEW IT WAS A THING) then certainly everyone would have been using it as the best and most successful weapon in space combat ever invented. So the new rule didn't make any sense because for it to make sense it would either have to have been a brand new discovery (which would have stunk a bit of deus ex machina) or something that had been used in previous films.<br><br>I don't particularly want to write a total review of all the plot holes and examples of shoddy lazy writing in this film. If you're interested you can tune into an extensive video analysis of the film by a YouTuber called MauLer and it is entitled "A Critique of Star Wars: The Last Jedi." I found his critique to be spot on in every detail in some cases mirroring my own notions and in others calling to mind writing mistakes that hadn't yet occurred to me. Warning: if you think this review is long then his is epic.<br><br>There is one last fault about the film that may not be so much a question of poor plotting that I would like to address. It is a question of theme. <br><br>I believe the reason so many of us have come to love Star Wars and its universe so much is because the first three films gave us something far more substantial that light saber duels space dogfights and pointy-eared green muppets. I believe the first films were so successful because they preached (or perhaps confirmed for us) a message of faith.<br><br>You may remember that in the closing moments of the first film's Death Star battle Obi Wan whispered to Luke from beyond the grave "use the force Luke." Luke was the main character of the film. The theme of the film was wrapped up in his story arc. He was pulled from a life of obscurity and told that there was something special about him--that he had a gift. He was further taught that if he would but trust his feelings with his gift he could accomplish anything.<br><br>When Obi Wan tells Luke to use the force he is effectively telling him that he must believe. Luke does and uses the force and with it is able to destroy the Death Star and save everyone.<br><br>In the second movie the theme is the same. When Luke cannot move the X-wing but Yoda can Luke says he can't believe it. Yoda replies "that is why you fail." Because Luke fails to have faith in the calm light side of the force but instead goes off to rescue his companions in Cloud City he again fails (to some degree...some of them do get saved after all) as manifested in the loss of his hand.<br><br>In Return of the Jedi Luke manages to believe again to the point that he throws aside his light saber in the presence of the Emperor come what may. For his faithfulness he is rewarded with the turning of his father back to the light and the victory of the rebels over the empire.<br><br>So not only did the original trilogy ask us to suspend our disbelief in order that we might enjoy the fictional story they recounted but they went further and said that we could suspend our disbelief in real life. They carried home the theme that YOU are special YOU have a gift and if you will but believe you can accomplish anything. I think that theme resonated powerfully with a great number of us and we associated that feeling with lightsabers space dogfights and pointy-eared muppets.<br><br>The new films not only seem muddy in their themes but actually ERASE the theme of the original series. Luke Skywalker is no longer special. He has turned from his gift. He believed and it worked for a time but then everything fell apart and he lost everything. All the victories that came from his gift and belief in the original trilogy were erased by the new films (and of course so of this was done in episode 7 so this film is not completely to blame). <br><br>Many people after watching and thinking about the three prequels started to say that George Lucas had ruined their childhood. Perhaps he had to some degree by replacing the theme of special gifts and belief with midichlorians. But with this film Rian Johnson has done far worse. He has utterly assassinated the character of Luke Skywalker. He has shown that having a gift and believing in it will only win you heartache and pain and all your efforts will turn the people you most care for into failures or worse yet evil mass-murdering monsters. What an awful direction to go in with such a beloved storyline. One wonders if Rian Johnson or Kathleen Kennedy or whoever else it was that chose this direction even liked the original movies., 1.0,  Matthew S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/818562709/, January 28 2018, 
 The worst star wars movie that I've ever seen just almost two hours of non sense story blended with remakes from the other movies from star wars what a waste of time., ni,  Oxidit B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/939252798/, January 28 2018, 
 Not impressed at all! Poor character choices in regard to continuity from the last film and not to mention political and pseudo neo liberal waffle rammed down your throat at the expense of the story/plot. Annoying new characters that I was hoping would die and ludicrous sub plots as well as major ones that seemed like poor writing and made if not zero sense very little indeed!, ni,  Jason M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977079130/, January 28 2018, 
 Not only is this the worst Star Wars movie to date it is I think the worst story ever told in the Star Wars universe. It drops the ball on just about every plot device it was given from TFA. Combine the latter with forced humor that's basically used to ruin any dramatic moments the audience might feel and you get a film that seems determined to rob the viewer of moments of genuine emotion. The politics in this film were so in your face that they could be called stereoscopic. I feel like I paid $20 so a bunch of people could explain to me know how awful I am for being a white male. Did I mention a complete lack of character development? I honestly wish they would have let Rian Johnson keep the writer-director position for Episode IX only then would we see the true backlash of from fans that would refuse to see the film. Save your money and rent it on Redbox., 1.0,  Jason R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/875377092/, January 28 2018, 
 I've left every Star Wars Movie feeling a sense of awe &amp exhileration-until The Last Jedi. Just had no emotional attachment to the story at all. Unless you count boredom &amp irritation. Keeping Finn and Rey apart the entire movie-he IS the only character that brings the charm-and saddling her w Gloomy Gus Luke didn't add wto the movie. And way too many convenient fortuitous moments that felt cringeworthy-Leia awakening from her coma in the nick of time Yoda appearing etc., 3.0,  Eva C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/909536994/, January 28 2018, 
 TFA reduced Han Solo to an absentee father/husband just to play it safe and make him a smuggler again. TLJ reduces enthusiastic idealistic Luke Skywalker to a murderous jaded a-hole. This Disney tripe totally destroys Star Wars canon and ruins everything that made the bond between the characters from the original trilogy so special.<br><br>As a male who finds himself aligned with the feminist agenda in many respects the constant "boys against girls" routine in this movie becomes nauseating very quickly.<br><br>I couldn't be more disappointed with the direction this new series is going in... Honestly though these movies aren't being made anymore by anyone's passion to tell a particular story. It's all a big cash grab at this point.<br><br>I am hereby done with new Star Wars., 1.0,  Joe K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977017138/, January 28 2018,

 The Last Jedi (TLJ) is in many ways the polar opposite of The Force Awakens (TFA). TFA directed by JJ Abrams took very few risks by creating a modern rehash of a new hope. While I wasn't the biggest fan of TFA's "play it safe" plot and writing it did however introduce new characters which I thought would be expounded upon in TLJ. <br><br>TLJ directed by Rian Johnson does the opposite of what Abrams did in TFA by taking every risk in the book. However The risks that Johnson took unfortunately hurt the development of the old trilogy characters as well as the new characters introduced in TFA.<br>+ The main thing I liked about TLJ was all the scenes with Kylo Ren. Adam Driver does a great job playing who I believe to be the only relatable character in the new trilogy.<br>- Luke the former symbol of hope and optimism is for some reason a disheveled hermit on an island. By this point you would expect him to be some kind of all-powerful Jedi but he's exactly the opposite and has cut himself off from the force?<br>- Leia is floating in the vacuum of space and uses the force to fly to a ship?<br>- Rey is a very one dimensional character and is seemingly elite at every skill. She receives one lesson in training from Luke and suddenly has full control over her powers. (unbelievable)<br>- Poe and Finn are basically the same impulsive and frustrated character. Poe's character is diminished by the introduction of Vice Admiral Holdo (bad character). Finn's character development is totally eaten by the introduction of Rose (ok character but shouldn't have been tied to Finn's arc). As it is the fans barely know anything about Poe and Finn but their character development is just destroyed by the introduction of these new and unnecessary characters.<br>- Characters like Maz Phasma and Snoke are heavily underutilized and are barely in the movie at all. <br>- There is also a series of twists in this film that attempt to be clever but are totally unnecessary. While I didn't mind the BIG twist I did think it was a missed opportunity. <br><br>One of my biggest problems with the new trilogy and TLJ is that there are very few Alien or Droid characters. By now the world is aware of Disney's push to make Star Wars more diverse with the casting of Rey (Female Heroine) Finn (Black Hero) and Rose (Asian Heroine) to appeal to audiences that were perhaps not reached before (which is totally fine). What they should understand is that the HUMAN RACE regardless of ethnicity is a minority in Star Wars! If you look at the Jedi Council in the prequel trilogy it is almost entirely made up of Alien characters. This idea that you have to be a human to be a major character or a Hero in Star Wars is totally wrong! <br><br>To sum things up I believed this new trilogy was doomed after I saw TFA. The time jump from ROTJ to TFA was just too much (30 years I believe). I would like to know WHY the empire is still at large. WHY are the Rebels STILL on the run despite having won a decisive victory on Endor in ROTJ. TLJ barely touches on how Ben Solo turned to the Dark Side but I would have liked to have seen HOW and WHY he turned to the Dark Side. Where did Snoke come from? Instead of giving us the juicy details TFA and TLJ just skip to the finish line deeming it totally meaningless. While Rian Johnson is catching a lot of heat for this film (and rightfully so) I am willing to give him another chance with his new trilogy. I can't help but feel he was tied down by the decisions of another director in J.J. Abrams. However in the end Johnson and Abrams still have much to learn about star wars (yoda pun intended). Instead of making these films up as they go and totally improvising Disney should have a REAL writer write a treatment for multiple films so there are no inconsistencies. Then they should get a REAL director to bring the story to the big screen. Overall The Last Jedi disappointed me as a Star Wars fan and is nothing more than a visual effects spectacle with a thin plot and thin characters., 1.5,  Ravi%20 K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977079981/, January 29 2018,

 I didn't understand the hate and low audience rating before but I do after watching it. I could barely keep myself watching. I'm admittedly not the biggest Star Wars fanboy but I'm shocked this was released to theaters in its current form.<br><br>Some spoilers below.<br><br>Prank call. Felt flat why did they do that.<br><br>What happened to literally all the plot threads set up in TFA?<br><br>Han Solo just died isn't anyone sad? He should be more than a plot device to add conflict between Kylo and Rey. <br><br>Leia flies? Okay no problem so why can she open a door to vacuum and there is no air sucking people out. This is a movie about space..<br><br>Why did they use Snoke so cheaply. He comes out of the shadows and is thrown away like so many other characters and plot threads.<br><br>The helmet. The shadow of Vader should be a huge thread through these three movies. It's not now.<br><br>Knights of Ren. Who are they. Where are they. Why not use them to foreshadow?<br><br>Rey beats Luke in training.<br><br>Luke's ghost should have the same look as him why did he show up with a freshly dyed beard?<br><br>The chubby girl chasing Finn's character like a 14 year old. Why? What did that serve.<br><br>The casino. What?<br><br>How is it the balance of power is exactly the same after a moon sized base was just destroyed and the resistance in essence won?<br><br>Why the fuck does something being bigger make it stronger again? I've had enough of gigantic ships and death stars.<br><br>Phasma. What a waste of a character.<br><br>I honestly had a hard time even paying attention to this movie. It felt like it took all the plot threads of Star Wars ate those along with the script and took a big steamy shit and stepped on it. It's hard to believe they greenlit this movie.<br><br>Positives: The effects were good &amp it had the look and feel of star wars.

 After The Phantom Menace I NEVER in a million years thought I'd say this again but The Last Jedi is by far the worst Star Wars movie of all time... The only thing worse from the Star Wars franchise is the Holiday Special from the 70's... The movie is all over the place and makes absolutely no sense when following TFA. It's just an unorganized mess of unfunny cringy jokes and SJW propaganda..., ,  Daniel D, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977079932/, January 29 2018, 
 First initial walking out of the theatre the superb visuals got me pumped but as I though more and more the movie became a disgusting mess that is garbage through and through. The only decent parts of the Movie are the opening space battle minus the jokes Rey and Ben's team up minus the whole Snoke is dead thing. Movie ruins all of Star War's cannon by making Ben Solo turn to the Dark Side because Luke was feeling very Prequel and needed to kill some youngling at least Vader did it while they were awake. Wait for clips of the good scenes on youtube and skip this worthless addition to Star Wars., 1.0,  Serra P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976993770/, January 29 2018, 
 A weak addition to the series. The technical aspects of this film are very well done. However the writing the direction and the story are atrocious. This film carries the star wars name but lacks a soul and does not feel like a star wars film at all. It fails completely in building upon the previous film and does minimal to improve upon already weak character development from the force awakens. I would not recommend this film., 2.5,  Paul K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/904385087/, January 29 2018, 
 So apparently half stars don't count so I came back to edit my review and give it 1 star.<br><br>I went to watch this movie with my brother and mom all excited. So coming <br>out of the cinema I asked them "Did you understand anything?". It is not that I didn't get what was going on in the movie but was in shock how bad it was. I couldn't believe what I'd watched. My mom said "It was so boring that in the last 30 minutes I was thinking about the chicken I can eat when we finally get home". At least the chicken was good so there is that.<br><br>The jokes were not funny and ruined serious scenes. I want good directors and writers not KK and her lapdogs! The utter disrespect towards Lucas and his characters is blood boiling.<br>As a woman I am angry. You write shitty women characters and you want me/us to feel represented and oh so thankful because they are in powerful positions. Shove it up your you know where. These are not powerful women! They are hateful overpowered and non deserving of their positions! I would only watch episode IX for Kylo. The ONLY character I can relate to and feel sympathy for. Hands down the best part of this hot piling shit of a movie. I could talk about what I hate about it all day but ain't nobody got time for that. <br><br>Everyone who loves Star Wars don't give your money to disney until they get themselves together., 1.0,  Elio R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977072986/, January 29 2018, 
 This was the most poorly written and thought-out movie I have seen in a long time. Disney succeeded in the biggest "dropping the ball" moment in movie-making history congrats. Terrible illogical character arcs (if you even want to call them that) hugely gaping plot holes that make no sense very little story and character progression and if it matters to you a senseless re-write of the SW universe "rules" and characters...very irreverent to SW.

 One of the biggest piles of hot garbage ever put to film.

 Such a disappointment. I think many fans who watched and idolized Luke Skywalker when they were children will be repulsed by the weak pointless ending of their childhood hero. <br><br>Here's another comparison. Watching Han Solo get killed by his son in TFA was one of the most intense emotional scenes I've witnessed in Star Wars. It was terrible and great at the same time. It was absolutely necessary in the story and fit perfectly. <br><br>When Luke dies and just evaporates staring at the sun I feel nothing. Its almost like the writer wanted to give a big FU to anyone who actually cared about this character.<br><br>So many other little annoyances but the Luke ending is the most obscene., 1.0,  Matt C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976981340/, January 29 2018, 
 I thought about calling this movie a dumpster fire but then I saw an actual dumpster fire and realized that it was more entertaining than this plotless agenda driven money grab.<br><br>Also what's up with the audience score apparently being frozen? I obviously didn't look at 178000 fan reviews individually but a quick scan of the most recent couple hundred or so makes me think that 49% is optimistic at best and mathematically implausable at worst., 1.0,  Terry S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977047103/, January 29 2018, 
 Updated to 1 star so it counts. This is my only review ever on Rotten Tomatoes. This movie was terrible. <br><br>Perhaps the more egregious assault is not the actual movie but journalists telling me why I'm wrong for not liking the movie. Yes I'm a fan but I'm open to change (if its good) I'm open to all-female heroes (if it fits the story) and I'm open to killing Luke (if it makes sense). I enjoyed Rogue One immensely. I'm not alt-right I didn't vote for Trump. I'm just a typical dude who saw an awkward poorly crafted garbage movie., 1.0,  Private U, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/835878556/, January 29 2018, 
 My post on Rotten Tomatoes. I gave it one star out five. <br><br> Disney has found their greatest platform upon to stand and wave their banner of leftist feminism rich anti-everything masculine and anything to do with the true story of Star Wars. <br> Ryan Johnson is a yes man to the true villian of the galaxy in Kathleen Kennedy and was rewarded for his destruction of the franchise with a new trilogy for his loyalty and his deplorable script and nothing short of a parody that slaps Star Wars fans in the face. <br> Ryan Johnson you are no friend of Star Wars and no friend to the Star Wars fan base. It is clear and undeniable in my opinion that little Ryan was tasked with destroying roying the film the story potentially the franchise and did so I with extreme predjudice. <br> The franchise is dead in the hands of Disney as far as I'm concerned. It would take two more films minimum written and directed by Gareth Edwards with no interference rewrites and reshoots to put this scattered story back together and put the WAR back into Star Wars and squeeze the story free of every last drop of the political venom that little Ryan and his momma (Kennedy) has had injected into and poisoned the story and soured the most dedicated fans., 1.0,  Daniel M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976986476/, January 29 2018, 
 "1/2 star" reviews and "Not interested reviews" Do not get added to the totals<br><br>I came back to adjust my review and upgrade to 1 star.<br><br>I see the score now at 48% so at least it is moving in a more accurate direction. When I first looked into this  shortly after I saw the movie opening night I think it was 58%. <br><br>The worst part about this movie I think for now is how Disney Kathleen Kennedy and Ryan J are commenting in such a way as to make it look like anyone not liking this movie is a racist women hater or a complete retard.<br><br>If you go to youtube or any social media platform you care to look into you will see women men young old every ethnic background making comments on why they hated this movie. <br><br>Unlike the people here with the 5 star reviews and with no indept reason why the people hating the movie go into detail as to why they hate it.<br><br>I see comments suggesting that those of us not liking the movie need to go see it again so that we will " Understand the great message inside the movie "<br><br>Never.<br><br>The only message I see in this movie is that if you have failed as a writer there is hope Disney is hiring and looking for people with no talent. <br><br>Honestly I think Disney and Kathleen K expected the fans to come in droves ( and they did) to see anything with the Star Wars name in it. It is obvious they did not expect this backlash. This seems to be the reason why this was able to pass from script to movie without anyone thinking how the fans would react to a incredibly poor script and to incredibly stupid changes. <br><br>Its almost as if they wanted to make a Harry Potter / Oliver twist / Guardians of the galaxy....star wars movie. The kid at the end of the movie made me think that was the direction they wanted for the Oliver Twist sort of spin off.... I dont know but it is just nuts. I do not have the words.....it is a confusing mess.<br><br>Anyway.....<br><br>Sure the movie made money but far short of The Force Awakens. Disney was expecting a 25%+ increase over TFA... and this movie will never get anywhere near that. Yes it made huge money but Star Wars with its fan base of hundreds of millions world wide this was a given in. All or most of the fans will see it and likely will never see it again. I saw it once and never again.<br><br>I did not like TFA but I did not hate it. But I am not big on reboots and TFA to me seemed a reboot of " A New Hope" I did however see the movie 3 times in theatre. This travesty I saw once and that was it I have no desire to ever see it again and I know in that sentiment I am not alone.<br><br>Disney and Kathleen K maybe thought they could troll all of us into buying into whatever story they wanted to pitch and for some people.... like the ones giving 5 star reviews it seems to have worked. ( wow seriously 5 stars for this movie...maybe if you can shut off your brain and not look at the errors and inconsitencys to the time line) <br><br>But this movie is going to fall short of making 2.5 billion. And if this is now the norm for star wars movies gone will be the big money days for a star wars movie.<br><br>If the Han Solo movie ( that no one was asking for) Is shit with poor writing or crazy changes to the Han Solo character the bulk of the fan base...now 52% ( according to RT..... I think it is more like 75% ) will say " Fuck you" <br><br>I am giving 1 star for seeing Mark Hammil again but not for seeing the character. I am not give any stars for the score or the visuals both were great. But for me for a star wars movie this should be expected and the norm not the exception. The rest of the movie if I could give negative 5 stars i would., 1.0,  Ted%20 W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977047508/, January 29 2018, 
 This movie gets full marks for special effects humour and action but unfortunately low marks for being full of literally hundreds of plot holes that insult your intelligence. The story arch and character development are seriously lacking. The movie ends with Supreme Leader Kylo Ren running the galaxy (presumably he hopes) with Rey... who may join him or oppose him. Rey is a Mary Sue who is more powerful than Kylo after ...

 Box office numbers are misleading. Trailers and professional critics have maliciously lured people into the theaters by cheating about what they would find there. Everyone expected a Star Wars movie that is a movie with the look and feel the mood the magic the lore of the Star Wars universe. This is not what they get at all. Lots of people paid for viewing this movie only to find themselves regretting it bitterly.<br>If it was possible for those people to get their money back and also subtract their number from the total the box office would amount to maybe one third of what it is now. Most probably less.<br>The truth will come out as soon as The Last Jedi is distributed as DVD/Blue Ray. No one will be buying it. Moreover the next installments of the franchise namely Solo and Episode 9 will fail the box office since the vast majority of comments here and elsewhere hint at people not wanting to spend any more money to be trolled and preached by Kathleen Kennedy and poor Rian Johnson who is maybe understanding now how big a mess he has done both to Star Wars and his career., 1.0,  Arthur F, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977079636/, January 29 2018,

 The second I found out Disney took over Star Wars I knew Star Wars was doomed. I knew it would turn into a pitch for girl power and diversity. Leia slapping a man? What if a man slapped a woman!!!? In addition I knew Disney would make Star Wars all flash and no substance. Substance to me is what makes Star Wars what it is. Star Wars was so deep with philosophy etc. that it leaves things subjective and open to interpretation. And to me that interpretation gives the viewer his/her own sense of what Star Wars is and can make it his/her own.<br><br>Anyway imagine if Disney stuck to the Star Wars script and for instance made Luke Skywalker the hero we all remember him to be. This movie could have easily topped one billion domestic. I hope you enjoy all the billions of dollars you're going to lose out on now Disney! You sold out Star Wars to appeal to nothing but women and SJW's and admit doing so isn't that right Rian Johnson? Funny how Rian Johnson is getting so defensive over his "work". Deep down you're admitting your guilt that you're an atrocity to the big screen.<br><br>As for all the professional "critics"... why don't you all grow a pair and tell us how you really feel. You all are too afraid to write a negative review? Take Disney's metaphorical dick out of your mouths and assholes and do your job. As for the critics who gave it a negative review we love you and appreciate you and we'll do our best to make sure you're always revered!<br><br>Oh and one more thing Rian. Stop acting like you're a genius. I know you are losing sleep and officially on medication since you know the entire world loathes you and thinks you're worthless. Loved your article Rian about how you couldn't wait to see the audiences reaction to the Canto Bight scene because you thought it was a masterpiece. Yeah I think us Star Wars fans have deemed that scene the most worthless scene of all time that has nothing to do with the movie. Stop deflecting Rian Johnson. You're done. Retire.<br><br>I'm nitpicking now but the casino planet should have at least had a Pazaak Den. : )<br><br>Anyway I give the 1-star for John Williams... the man is incredible., 1.0,  Scott A, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977075862/, January 29 2018, 
 Why this movie is dangerous for the true feminists and women in general.<br>In retrospective after watching this movie we have the possibility to try to understand why Daisy Ridley was casted for playing Rey the first female jedi hero (if we don't count Princess Leia who admittedly never shown to be aware of any force powers until she actually became Mary Poppins in The Last Jedi).<br>First of all let's take a look at her phisical appearance while outside the movie sets: gorgeous makeup long flowing hair generous miniskirts which let us actually see her nice legs open shoes with stilettoes low-cut shirts flashing/bright coloured dresses and shoes. In other words: a woman as we normally see them around. A woman who is not afraid to be a woman and to appeal also sexually the males and the women who watch her. A "normal" woman may I add.<br>Let's take a look at her phisical appearance in the SW movies: her naturally small breasts small hips and butt are further removed from everyone's sight through the use of very tight dresses which never fail to cover her erogenous zones. She does not sport a single trace of makeup. Her hair is tied up. In other word a chastized and de-sexualized de-feminized version of a woman.<br>What is the message that Disney or better Kathleen Kennedy wants to convey here?<br>Are they aware that they are basically saying to all women: "Look if you want to rule the world you have to dress like a man act like a man hide the physical evidence that you are not a man in other words you have to be a man".<br>How bad a role model is that?<br>Look at what Warner Bros did with Wonder Woman. Gal Gadot is a real woman (with ample breasts and hips flowing hair and gorgeous makeup) and she has been casted for playing Diana Prince a very strong and powerful woman in whom almost every other woman in the world can easily identify (and project) herself and who is not afraid at all of showing the world that she is a woman.<br>In the movie her breasts are evidenced not hidden by her costume. Her legs and feet too. And still she succeeds in portraying the most bad-ass female in the universe.<br>Sex appeal is just one of her powers. A very special power indeed since all other women in the world have it.<br>Rey has plenty of force powers. Unfortunately she does not have a bit of sex appeal and she has completely renounced her femininity which would have added some depth to her paper thin character. She barely resembles a woman. Why should women identify with her? Why should men feel attracted by her?<br>Really Disney you got confused. Sex is not the enemy and de-sexualizing every character will not lure men and women into the theaters., 1.0,  Carlos B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977079570/, January 29 2018,

 Far better than what I expected. Elements of a really great Star Wars film and some truly great moments make up for somewhat contrived plot (the ship chase seemed like a plot device) and perhaps unnecessary length. Most impressed with Mark Hamill he did a great job with what he was given. I really don't understand all the negative audience reviews overall a very good film with incredible effects and great sound track. The director took some risks and the end result is a worthy addition to the saga even if the film upset some people by doing the unexpected eg. Luke being conflicted. The story may have been more complex less black and white than what some fans were expecting but The Last Jedi is a very solid and entertaining ride start to finish highly recommended., 4.5,  Jarjar B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977079546/, January 29 2018,

 The plot had so many holes there were shoe-horned characters that took up much too much screen time and no character development. Rey did what she wanted and ended up on top because she knew more than the chosen one... The actors did what they could with the material they were given but whoever rewrote Luke obviously had no idea who they were writing about. Visually was fantastic substance in story was lacking. Also the military acumen of the rebel leaders leaves me wondering who put them in charge., 1.0,  Private U, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/810706412/, January 28 2018, 
 I don't hate all the things that I understand other viewers detested about this film. I don't particularly care about the weird milk sloth monsters although I find it to be a strange choice by the director to include it. Further I don't mind the angry emo teenager character that Adam Driver portrayed. In fact I rather think he's one of the best things about these new movies. My concerns generally have to do with poor storytelling. I was struck throughout the film that the plot was not the natural outcome of the characters desires and subsequent motivated actions. Rather it seemed that the different plot points were chosen and then the characters were forced to do ridiculous things to get to those points.<br><br>The most egregious example of this was the decision by Laura Dern's character Vice Admiral Holdo to refrain from explaining to most of the people under her command what her plan was. I understand some viewers are saying that she had to keep quiet about it in order to ensure that the First Order would not become apprised of the plan fearing that there might have been a spy on board the ship. But given that the First Order was obviously trying to murder everyone aboard the ship it would have had to have been a very loyal spy indeed who was willing to die with the Resistance on the off chance that he or she might be able to come up with one last bit of useful intelligence. Even if this were a legitimate concern certainly she could have told Po about her plan considering that he had just personally destroyed the First Order's massive super weapon in the previous movie and their Dreadnought in this one. There was no way he was a spy. There were other minor infractions like the need for rebel commanders to die while still piloting their ships as if auto pilot a droid or a brick and some rope couldn't keep the vessels flying in a straight line for the last few seconds before they were destroyed by the first order. I believe these rebel commanders had to sacrifice themselves just to set up the idea that Holdo had to stay on board the cruiser in order that she might be there to use it to ram the pursuing fleet.<br><br>Some of the other plot choices that were made in this movie had more to do with ignoring established rules of physics in the Star Wars universe or creating new rules that didn't make sense. An example of the latter was Holdo's using the Resistance's abandoned cruiser to ram the First Order fleet. There is nothing wrong with saying that a ship can be used as a hyperspeed ram to destroy another ship. It's a science fiction universe: you can say the physics are whatever you want. However this was a new rule that didn't make any sense in the context of all the other movies. If you could just ram a ship to destroy it how is it that the rebels didn't just send empty cruisers on suicide missions to destroy fleets of Imperial destroyers during the battle of Hoth? Why wasn't there a large ship full of rocks launched at the Death Star? If this was a thing (and apparently from the reaction of the First Order's commanders when they say Holdo bringing her ship about to ram them not only was it a thing but EVERYONE KNEW IT WAS A THING) then certainly everyone would have been using it as the best and most successful weapon in space combat ever invented. So the new rule didn't make any sense because for it to make sense it would either have to have been a brand new discovery (which would have stunk a bit of deus ex machina) or something that had been used in previous films.<br><br>I don't particularly want to write a total review of all the plot holes and examples of shoddy lazy writing in this film. If you're interested you can tune into an extensive video analysis of the film by a YouTuber called MauLer and it is entitled "A Critique of Star Wars: The Last Jedi." I found his critique to be spot on in every detail in some cases mirroring my own notions and in others calling to mind writing mistakes that hadn't yet occurred to me. Warning: if you think this review is long then his is epic.<br><br>There is one last fault about the film that may not be so much a question of poor plotting that I would like to address. It is a question of theme. <br><br>I believe the reason so many of us have come to love Star Wars and its universe so much is because the first three films gave us something far more substantial that light saber duels space dogfights and pointy-eared green muppets. I believe the first films were so successful because they preached (or perhaps confirmed for us) a message of faith.<br><br>You may remember that in the closing moments of the first film's Death Star battle Obi Wan whispered to Luke from beyond the grave "use the force Luke." Luke was the main character of the film. The theme of the film was wrapped up in his story arc. He was pulled from a life of obscurity and told that there was something special about him--that he had a gift. He was further taught that if he would but trust his feelings with his gift he could accomplish anything.<br><br>When Obi Wan tells Luke to use the force he is effectively telling him that he must believe. Luke does and uses the force and with it is able to destroy the Death Star and save everyone.<br><br>In the second movie the theme is the same. When Luke cannot move the X-wing but Yoda can Luke says he can't believe it. Yoda replies "that is why you fail." Because Luke fails to have faith in the calm light side of the force but instead goes off to rescue his companions in Cloud City he again fails (to some degree...some of them do get saved after all) as manifested in the loss of his hand.<br><br>In Return of the Jedi Luke manages to believe again to the point that he throws aside his light saber in the presence of the Emperor come what may. For his faithfulness he is rewarded with the turning of his father back to the light and the victory of the rebels over the empire.<br><br>So not only did the original trilogy ask us to suspend our disbelief in order that we might enjoy the fictional story they recounted but they went further and said that we could suspend our disbelief in real life. They carried home the theme that YOU are special YOU have a gift and if you will but believe you can accomplish anything. I think that theme resonated powerfully with a great number of us and we associated that feeling with lightsabers space dogfights and pointy-eared muppets.<br><br>The new films not only seem muddy in their themes but actually ERASE the theme of the original series. Luke Skywalker is no longer special. He has turned from his gift. He believed and it worked for a time but then everything fell apart and he lost everything. All the victories that came from his gift and belief in the original trilogy were erased by the new films (and of course so of this was done in episode 7 so this film is not completely to blame). <br><br>Many people after watching and thinking about the three prequels started to say that George Lucas had ruined their childhood. Perhaps he had to some degree by replacing the theme of special gifts and belief with midichlorians. But with this film Rian Johnson has done far worse. He has utterly assassinated the character of Luke Skywalker. He has shown that having a gift and believing in it will only win you heartache and pain and all your efforts will turn the people you most care for into failures or worse yet evil mass-murdering monsters. What an awful direction to go in with such a beloved storyline. One wonders if Rian Johnson or Kathleen Kennedy or whoever else it was that chose this direction even liked the original movies., 1.0,  Matthew S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/818562709/, January 28 2018,

 Not only is this the worst Star Wars movie to date it is I think the worst story ever told in the Star Wars universe. It drops the ball on just about every plot device it was given from TFA. Combine the latter with forced humor that's basically used to ruin any dramatic moments the audience might feel and you get a film that seems determined to rob the viewer of moments of genuine emotion. The politics in this film were so in your face that they could be called stereoscopic. I feel like I paid $20 so a bunch of people could explain to me know how awful I am for being a white male. Did I mention a complete lack of character development? I honestly wish they would have let Rian Johnson keep the writer-director position for Episode IX only then would we see the true backlash of from fans that would refuse to see the film.

 TFA reduced Han Solo to an absentee father/husband just to play it safe and make him a smuggler again. TLJ reduces enthusiastic idealistic Luke Skywalker to a murderous jaded a-hole.

 When a Star Wars movie starts with an inter-galactic crank call you know you are in for something special! Every installment of this ever increasing whimpering and whining saga has left me more and more not disappointed but disgusted. A crying and then later shirtless conflicted goth teenage Kylo Ren and the now fifty-something and still whining Luke chugging down some fresh blue milk literally makes me sick. How anyone could watch this nonsense and say it was good let alone great leaves me speechless., 0.5,  Steven H, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/913626355/, January 28 2018, 
 The Disney marketing machine ruined star wars by CREATING mystery of Rey's past and Snoke's origin only to dismiss it as irrelevant. The forced love story was bad too. I HATED the casino scene. I can tell Disney marketing team thought FORCING transgender multicultural themes in this movie would sell more tickets. I wish they added a diverse cast without shoving it down our throats. The only GOOD scene was the "hyperspace kill". Other than that.......WHY did they do Luke that way. Luke would NEVER do something like that to Kylo., 0.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976943353/, January 28 2018,

 The Disney shills have been caught! Look at the 4 and 5 star reviewers profile. They are all creating accounts now and giving other movies ratings (mostly disney movies) with no comments so it looks like they are actually real reviews. If you look at their profiles closely you can see that all the other reviews they have done were created within minutes of each other. It shows the time and date right next to the stars. It is completely official now that disney is corrupting these forums with false reviews. This movie was horrible and disney will be lucky to sell half the tickets with episode 9. This was a desecration of everything star wars. Check out Alex B's profile for example (should be close to my review) all movie reviews were done within 1 to 2 minutes of their star wars review., 1.0,  Lewd M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977078791/, January 28 2018, 
 When it comes to multi-generational entertainment franchises four come immediately to mind: Star Trek James Bond Mission: Impossible and Star Wars.<br><br>Over the years Star Trek has seen six TV series two movie series and an animated series. I haven't seen an episode of Discovery but all the other entries have remained consistent in terms of vision and character development.<br><br>The James bond films have been the longest continually running film series of all time with 24 entries. The 007 personalities have been quite different over the years but the overall theme again has remained consistent.<br><br>Mission: Impossible has seen two TV series and five feature films starring Tom Cruise. The first film attempted to "throw away the past" just like The Last Jedi. Throughout the television series Mr. Phelps was thoroughly committed to the IMF cause and his reputation was without blemish. Then the first movie came along and Mr. Phelps was suddenly disillusioned and became an anti-hero. Can anyone say Luke Skywalker? When the original MI cast previewed the first installment they were asked about the movie. They responded "Yes it was a movie." Can anyone say Mark Hamill? Fortunately the film series returned to the original formula and brought us four enjoyable movies.<br><br>The Star Wars franchise has brought us ten movies an animated series TV specials and many other projects. The timeline characters and the Force itself has remained consistent since 1977. Along comes The Last Jedi and once again writers/producers think it's a great idea to "throw away the past." Heroic Luke is transformed into disillusioned anti-hero. Beloved characters are either unceremoniously killed off or reduced to cameo role status. By the movie's end there are no heroes to be found only flawed heroines. Hopefully the Star Wars galaxy braintrust will learn the lesson of the first Mission: Impossible movie and return the franchise back to its glorious past.<br><br>My 23 year old son saw the movie first and was anxious to hear what I thought of it. I told him the more I think about The Last Jedi the more I dislike it. My son laughed and said he had the same sentiments. When he left the theater he gave it a B- but three weeks later the grade is down to a D+.<br><br>One last thought: Part of the reason people go to movies is to escape the world of political correctness and polarizing governmental thought. The Last Jedi removed the charm of the galaxy far far away and replaced it with the reality of our own Milky Way galaxy. In the future please don't do that again., 1.5,  R Scott Y, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/907506597/, January 28 2018,

 This my first review ever. Felt it nessecary due to the dramatic difference in critic score vs audience. It's a little concerning rotten tomatoes. What critics are getting paid by Disney to say that movie was good? It was one of the worst movies I've seen. Between squeezing in a few Hollywood political agendas and trying to make Star Wars a comedy it was the worst movie I have seen in awhile. I don't care what you think about this country Hollywood. Just make movies. If you want us to see that women can be in power then get them out of those dresses and get them into some fighting clothes. Can't be both. Who's bright idea was it at Disney to try and squeeze in a message for animal rights in a Star Wars movie??? Really? Gross! Do it elsewhere please. Also Disney the force has rules if someone is a Jedi and they get shot or blown up then they are dead. They are not gods. Now that I know Luke and Leia can be shot and blown up into space and still survive there's no real thrill for me anymore cuz there just invincible. Lastely Star Wars is not a comedy. They don't make prank calls to each others ships. Not cool there at war not a joke. Thanks for killing my favorite series Disney.

 This movie undermines the old movies and also undermines episode 7. I felt like an empty husk after leaving the theatre. You are better of not watching it. This movie effectively has not only been deeply disrespectful to the mythos of Luke Skywalker but it has also killed Star Wars., 1.0,  This movie has does definitely changed the atmosphere and the climate in the Star Wars universe. Some of the action sequences were performed fantastically while some of the performance make me cringe like they shouldn't have considered even putting that thought into production. <br>The action scene in which Kylo Ren confronted General Organa's Capital Ship really got us the audience involved in what was to come in the next scene. This scene really gave us the audience a reason why Kylo may turn back to the good side. Rian Johnson really does a fantastic job on showing the inner conflict and the raw emotions that was inflicted the main antagonist (Kylo). Throughout the entire movie we are constantly reminded about his inner struggles on deciding who he should be. Kylo is often deciding should he be a villain or the hero in all of this. By the end of this movie Kylo decides to need a new direction of an evil villain that will definitely make Star Wars fans interested for the next Star Wars Blockbuster., 4.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977078527/, January 28 2018,

 This was utter crap good to see all the special effects and it "looked cool" because of all the money they had to make this movie. But Rey is basically an infallible GOD character who can do anything that any other force user can do but 10000x better. mLuke could life 3 3lb rocks perhaps Rey can lift 100 1 ton rocks?? The Female-Badass movement for movies is bad and ruins plot development. Even Fin and his new girlfriend made no sense! They had no long lasting conflict with the New Order TOGETHER! Fin just woke up and eventually found a female mechanic. Then they spend time together trying to .... to save the crew... (no spoilers) and it was no time at all!

 The Last Jedi is a beautiful film and wonderful story. Go in with no expectations Ryan Johnson is telling a story that isn't going to go the way you think.

 More than 35 years ago one of the most iconic brands in US history decided to change the formula for its success- literally. Coke had been dominate in the marketplace for nearly 100 years at the time. From its southern roots to the spread across the globe Coke became one of the most prominent brands in US history. In fact during WWII despite the rationing of sugar Coke was exempt due to its importance to American morale. "Every man in uniform gets a coke". By the 1980s Coke's dominance appeared to diminish when taste tests revealed an approval rating of 12% compared to Pepsi's 11%. Coke thought America preferred the less fizzy sweeter taste of Pepsi thus the change in formula. Coke did thousands of taste tests in various markets with the new formula then rolled it out. It's now widely regarded as one of the biggest blunders in US corporate history. Fans revolted. There were boycotts a spread of activism and media coverage despite the existence of social media a grassroots campaign was born. 79 days later the CEO of Coke admitted their mistake and reversed course. And in the end it all worked out of for Coke but only because the original coke was brought back. <br><br>Earlier this month another iconic brand in the U.S attempted to change their formula. Much like Coke Star Wars felt 40 years of success needed a new taste a new formula for a new generation if we're still using cola analogies. Rian Johnson the newest director of Star Wars sought to change this formula with his vision doing away with 40 years of great success. With Luke Skywalker he destroyed the most iconic cinematic hero for multiple generations rewrote the rules of the force eliminating the Sith and Jedi dynamic and failed to explain characters that required explanation. The Force Awakens gave one of the easiest hand-offs to its next director only requiring a custodian to continue where it left off. Instead Rian Johnson appeared to make a movie independent of a trilogy and the star wars universe as a whole. Like Mark Hamill said "Not my Luke Skywalker maybe Jake Skywalker". It should have been very clear with The Force Awakens and Rogue one with the appearance of Luke and Vader in each and how this changed each movie how excited everyone was. <br><br>One thing Coke failed to measure in its quest for change for a wider market share and more money was what this would do to the customers and fans of Coke original. Sure new Coke may have tasted great in taste tests just as Last Jedi tastes "OK". But if you take away the 40-year history of Star Wars and give us The Last Jedi it tastes awful. Coke became more than just a cola drink. It was part of the fabric of Americana. A coke and a hamburger. It was woven deeply into the fabric of society. Star Wars became more than a movie. Star Wars and a Coke not a New star war and a New Coke but Star Wars and Coke. Star Wars is on its way to a very disappointing box office in comparison to The Force Awakens. Reviews are scathing fans have revolted setting up a terrible box office for the 3rd installment then the trilogy Rian will work on hundreds and hundreds of million dollars gone. <br><br>in 1985 coke had an easier fix by bringing back the original. Star Wars is in a much more precarious position because of what this director did it won't be as easy to just bring back Star Wars the original formula. In fact it might be impossible. The next director JJ Abrams will need to be extremely creative to unravel the damage. In short don't fiddle with success.

 I grew up with Star Wars as a massive part of my life. The Phantom Menace was the first movie I ever saw in a midnight premiere. I was less than a year old. I have grown up with the books and comic books and television series. I bought lightsabers and action figures. I can whip out prequel memes like the best of them. And I have dedicated my time to Star Wars. And when I went to see this movie I was expecting something great. I was expecting something that would have enough meat on its bones to tide us over on theories and speculation for the next two years. Like TFA did. BOY WAS I WRONG. It was a nightmare from beginning to end. Not only was this film full of inconsistencies of character and plot but some of the cinamatography techniques were straight up stolen from other films and shows. This movie was like if you took clips from battle star galactica and various sifi movies and you strung them together to make a crappy YouTube "fan" edit out of them. Except the actual crappy YouTube edit would be more fulfilling and "Star Wars" than this movie. I hated it. Because it made all the TFA (which was actually a good film) seem crappy in retrospect and that makes me furious. I hated it. It is officially my least favorite Star Wars movie.

 ******THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS****** <br><br>Let me start by... again... ranting against professional critics. Once again they have proven themselves completely out of touch with the actual ticket buying public. The critics reviews on this site show a stellar 92% approval rating while actual ticket buyers as of this writing gave it a 53% approval rating. <br><br>I remember going to the very first Star Wars movie back in the late 70's. I was a science fiction geek reading as many books by as many authors that I could. It was obvious that it was something special... that it was the start of something really special in movies. <br><br>Unfortunately but not entirely surprising the rest of the Star wars movies have been kind of hit and miss. <br><br>The Last Jedi was a definite miss. You know how some movies are so bad they're good? This one is so bad...it's just very very bad. The Force Awakens and Rogue One were a great reboot of the series that Episodes 1-3 came close to destroying so I had very high hopes for The Last Jedi... too high I guess because I left the theater feeling completely ripped off...and the more I think about it the more obvious the glaring flaws in this move become. <br><br>Unlike the good Star Wars movies (or any movie for that matter) this one was all cover and no book. Star Wars movies aren't really known for having a bullet proof plot but this one was just sad. It's like they blew their budget on special effects (which really weren't all that special) and forgot to hire writers. <br><br>****Ok... THERE ARE LOTS AND LOTS OF SPOILERS COMING UP... EVEN THOUGH THE MOVIE WAS SPOILED LONG BEFORE I WROTE ABOUT IT***** <br><br>By the time the last of the rebel ships were almost out of gas so was the movie. They had enough steam to stay just out of reach of the super duper bad guy Dreadnought... which can decimate a planet from orbit but was impotent against a few virtually defenseless out of fuel ships. <br><br>It was a bit like watching the 'Death by Zamboni' scene in Deadpool... except it took much longer and just wasn't funny... or in any other way entertaining or believable. <br><br>Then... with time running out for the good guys... the heroes embark on a cross galaxy completely gratuitous time killing side quest hail Mary search for the only code breaker that could help them out... when throughout the series the best code breakers have been the pint sized droids... not people. <br><br>Of course this guy screws over our heroes...all for another very unsuccessful attempt at adding a bit of suspense. <br><br>I haven't been this let down after a Star Wars movie since Jar Jar... and to be honest Episode 1 was actually more entertaining. <br><br>This movie reminded me of 'Valerian'... plenty of bling which turned out to be mostly CG lipstick on a pig. The plot (such as it was) didn't do a thing to advance the series. It explained nothing and went nowhere. The acting was wooden and dull... or simply unbelievable. Since it was mostly the same cast from The Force Awakens and I enjoyed that I have to lay the blame at the feet of the director...who also gets the blame for writing this thing.<br><br>And what is with those idiotic vehicles on a stick? What does the stick do? How is it better than wheels or simply levitating like everything else that isn't a walker? How does it make sense... even in a fictional world? <br><br>Oh... I almost forgot about the bombers that used a hand held 1950's garage door opener for the only bomb release button (and one not secured in any way to anyone or anything) which means it could easily be knocked out of ones hand or otherwise rendered useless if the bombardier happens to die on the job. On the other hand it makes for a cheap device which is supposed to add suspense but succeeds only in insulting the viewer.<br><br>Oh yah... how do you drop bombs in space... ? <br><br>Plus... let's sacrifice a human general on a suicide mission that could easily have been performed by a droid... or a simple auto pilot? <br><br>In retrospect pretty much every scene is seriously flawed. Hopefully Rian Johnson who wrote and directed this debacle won't be given another chance to helm another episode. <br><br>I was going to give this movie a 2 but after going over my review I realize that was much too generous. <br><br>It is quite possibly the worst Star Wars movie ever made. Star Wars fans should just stay at home.

TLJ is by far the worst Star Wars movie ever!! It pisses me off that trolls are giving this 5 stars to keep the score up!! It's so obvious that it's bullshit. The real reviews are from the true fans and this movie should be at 25% based on the reviews by them., wts,  Ray W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977009842/, January 27 2018,

 [Important note: I don't review movies and I'm NOT a Star Wars "fan boy." I don't know the name of Jabba's little laughing rat guy and stuff like that. I'm simply a fan--a solid but casual fan who likes Star Trek (and Firefly and Lord of the Rings and Mexican food and some other things that aren't legitimately compared to Star Wars) more. The reason I sat down and wrote this out was pure therapy. Just trying to get the thoughts out of my head and move on with my life.]<br><br>As is my standard practice with movies I reeeeally want to see I went into this one in a near total information vacuum on opening weekend having avoided reading anything at all about it except for a quick scan of only "Fresh" review summaries on RT. I usually allow myself that just to reinforce the optimism and give myself the best possible shot at loving a movie I really want to love. And though you always assume there will be some fan hatred (yawn) I wasn't even aware of it before I saw the movie let alone familiar with any of its specifics. <br><br>This movie was a strange experience. I was entertained and generally positive about The Last Jedi almost all the way through it glossing over everything I was tempted to be bugged by with the confidence that it all would be justified and the movie would end in amazing tantalizing fashion. Then it... ended. Wait what? I sat there in sort of a daze got up wandered out of the theater thinking and thinking about what I'd just seen in context with the movie that preceded it and the fact that a movie will follow it and by the time I got to my car I was grappling with the weird realization that I'd just seen a bad movie. This second movie of a trilogy I've been so excited about for so long was so bad in fact that I found myself uninterested in seeing the third. That's not how the middle movie of a trilogy is supposed to work is it?<br><br>The Last Jedi didn't make you give a little laughing rat guy's as$ about any new-trilogy characters (which it desperately needed to do since we're quickly running out of beloved original-trilogy characters) didn't make Kylo Ren scary (which it desperately needed to do since it killed off the only potentially scary bad guy) didn't further the story in any significant way. It threw out every interesting question set up by The Force Awakens. Which I swear I was okay with while watching this entertaining enough movie in real time assuming new interesting questions would replace them by the end. Nope. Sorry but "Is a love triangle between these three characters I don't care about and who have no chemistry together anyway going to develop?" is not an interesting question.<br><br>What Luke did with that light saber Rey handed him is exactly what Rian Johnson did with the entire previous movie. And that still could have worked. I'm perfectly fine with "Nope we're not doin' that..." but you need to follow it with "This is what we're doing instead!..." and give us something even better to hold onto heading into the last movie. Or you know something decent to hold onto. Something... at all. I'm not picky. The key is to not leave the fans feeling totally empty-- like you just sucked out their souls chewed up and digested their souls and then pooped their souls back out all over them. I mean thanks for not keeping my soul there Mr. Johnson but jeeze. Not cool.<br><br>My disinterest isn't complete though. I'm curious how J.J. Abrams will handle Leia/Carrie Fisher in the next movie since this one-bafflingly-punted on that tricky issue (as it did with all other questions the audience had going in-punted or just said "Screw you! Ha-ha! NERDS!!"). I'll watch IX but it won't be in the theater I already know that. And that's a really bizarre thing to come to terms with. Since I was 7-years-old I could never have imagined that being the case with me and an upcoming Star Wars movie., 2.0,  Dustin R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/894432394/, January 27 2018,

 It was entertaining on it's own. Some parts had you on the edge of your seat. However it does not fit with the original story at all. Now I won't get political and business like but many factors went wrong.

 i thought this movie was quite good. the dialogue was witty at times and emotionally gripping at times. The use of the force was done much better then the prequels (jibberish about midichlorians) and the original trilogy (magic an old man can do which is never really explained). <br><br>I also thought when Leia travelled to the ship using the force was very entertaining and well-needed in the star wars anthology as leia using force was a concept meant to be used in the empire strikes back.talking about the empire strikes back i thought the movie was more original compared to the force awakens. rose was also a good character i hope she survives and is a character in episode IX. luke's conclusion was dramtic and one of the best star wars moments.<br><br>i don't get the hate this film has been getting. it was a solid addition to the ever-growing Star wars anthology in my opinion it was better then the force awakens. also porgs!, 5.0,  John D, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977076485/, January 27 2018, 
 "Re-rating as 1 star since apparently ratings of zero or half stars are not calculated into the aggregate."<br><br>The last Jedi fails to tell the story it is full of many pieces of undeveloped ideas that belong in some other really bad movies. <br><br>The Star Wars Saga has been an incredible journey. I loved the first movies learning of the Jedi lore and the tangled ribbons of coherent drama intrigue suspense and imagination. It was a ground-breaking hold-your-breath experience that had you on pins and needles waiting to find out how the universe far far away would be righted. Likewise I enjoyed the majesty mystery and turmoil of the following prequel trilogy that contrast the revelation of Anakin's fall. Then J.J. Abrams made magic happen awakening our hearts with the powers of the force renewed. Furthermore the Rogue One narrative snared akin to a spider's web hook-line to a shockingly captivating finale. In each of these tales Star Wars has been a cohesive line of thought building to a crescendo and even the beloved droids in each of these movies have made valuable contributions to the storylines...until now. <br><br>Now we have Rian Johnson scraping the diamonds into the trash with all his other garbage filler. In his version presented in The Last Jedi we are given unrelated fragments with no regard to the story arc no build for the hero's fall to even remotely establish a belief or investment into Luke's uncharacteristic personality change and no balance in what force use actually means. Now that Rian Johnson's Jedi ghosts can call lightning down from heaven they can just zap Kylo Ren and this horribly written movie into the place wherever Snoke came from. The boundaries that made the story cohesive have been obliterated to the point that anyone can do anything with the force without training practice or any measure of expertise and so the foundations that built the lore have been shattered like glass. With all the openings that J.J. Abrams offered in his respectful bow to Lucas' genius there is simply no way to fix this chaotic mess Rian Johnson hurled in our direction and I am sorry to see this 40-year love affair end. <br><br><br>This disaster of a movie has Jedi lore morphed into an ADHD Marvel altered universe with Mary Sue and Mary Poppins starring in a story mucking about in pointless spinning circles dead ends ill jokes misplaced subtext and substance no character development unanswered or poorly answered questions and the hero's Sybil complex. I waited decades to find out what happened to Luke and I got rubbish. As an original fan thrilled to hear Lucas permitting his jewel to continue and knowing the potential I am now forced to remove this monumental disaster The Last Jedi from my own personal Star Wars canon. This version left a lingering physical gut-punched reaction-like the day you find your love cheating it's a betrayal of lore and character. With green teat milk floating force filled super-Leia and Yoda flubs fandom can already Force project the future outcome of a Rian Johnson-trilogy: Garbage Shoots I II &amp....Toss This Over Your Shoulder-Fail III. <br><br><br><br>Rian Johnson can polish a rock and we can all say it is a real shiny rock but hey a rock is just a rock. And regardless of all the talent and resources at his fingertips his story hit rock bottom on the fan meter because this movie is not Star Wars lore. It should be renamed Rian Wars and be buried off-world far far away. <br><br>Podium pollution aside with all the many awkward insults to various groups perhaps Disney was attempting an anti-order or Antireligion propaganda to soothe big pocket snowflakes. In the next movie they can eliminate child slavery because they surely exterminated franchise's baby in this one.<br><br>I am not of the new generation that just likes shiny rocks but being familiar with the type I regret that Walt Disney now caters to that crowd. My last hope is that the Skywalker story sees justice someday in a real fan film.

All we wanted was to escape back into the STAR WARS mythos for a couple of hours. Taste that magic again. Hundreds of millions of people in straightjackets glued to our chairs ready and willing to accept (just about) anything STAR WARS.<br><br>And then they injected us with their new serum: THE LAST JEDI<br><br>THAT is the true story of this abominable movie (which had no story itself). The audience. The STAR WARS generation. <br><br>EXPERIMENTATION - LEVEL 1<br><br>Demolish the old. The past doesn't matter. The previous Trilogies were pockmarked with bigoted idiot curmudgeons who held everyone down. They are evil. They have no honor. You should feel ashamed for even liking those movies.<br><br>EXPERIMENTATION - LEVEL 2<br><br>THE MILLENNIAL MASTER - this is the new direction Disney is taking THE FORCE. Grey Snowflakes. Everyone gets a trophy. Everyone gets a job. Everyone is a master of THE FORCE. No training. No hard work. Nothing. I want that fucking bag of Skittles across the cafeteria in that kid's hand. BAM! Now it's in my fucking hand bitch! I can't wait to see Rey train the first generation of Grey Snowfla- (errr I mean Millennial Masters). "I've gathered you all here for this momentous occasion. Your first lesson will be..... hmmm.... your first lesson will be... Congratulations! You are all Millennial Masters!!!" <br><br>EXPERIMENTATION - LEVEL 3<br><br>Think like us. We know better. We're Disney. You can trust us. I know you didn't ask for them but here are our core beliefs. White men are evil or complete fools usually both. Non-white people are good. But non-white males are idiots. Women know all and should lead in peacetime and war and men should be put down. The wealthy are evil. Capitalism is evil (from Disney! Hah hah) Eating meat is evil. Domesticating animals is evil (but child slavery ehhh that's OK.) There IS no good and evil!!! (talk about contradicting oneself!) The First Order isn't really bad actually. Are they any worse than the Resistance? Compared to the EVIL military industrial complex The First Order hardly rates at all. Kylo Ren is misunderstood (and kinda cute!). He might even agree to go out with you if you are nice to him. Bad boys are so sexy when they are abusive. In short we are not fighting for freedom from the First Order we are fighting to overtake the audience's freedom of thought. This isn't a movie really. We're here to tell you what to think and how to live your lives.<br><br>EXPERIMENTATION - LEVEL 4<br><br>We're coming for your children. <br><br>(Here's your fucking Snowflake decoder ring Timmy.

Failure to develop compelling characters failure of plot failure of continuity failure of tone failure of execution failure of message.

 Not interested...won't ever see it...even for free.<br><br>Observations:<br>1) So RT like a dishonest butcher in the grocery store are you EVER going to take your thumb off the scale? The Audience score has not budged in either direction for over a week now. With the searing negative reviews clearly outdistancing the bland positive reviews you can't convince many of us that you haven't frozen it at 49% at the behest of your Disney Masters. Cowards...<br><br>2) For the few 5-star-perfect reviews I laugh at the perfect rating juxtaposed with "...but it's not perfect...it has its flaws...". Funny how the negative reviewers are accused of being ignorant butt-hurt fanboys and/or 4-chan trolls yet these Disney damage-controllers and apologist-trolls are desperately trying to artificially inflate a dismal audience score (with RT's help of course).<br><br>3) To the apologists that condescendingly argue that to like the film often requires repeated viewings: sorry but my time is too valuable to waste sitting in a theatre with idiots that can't put their smartphones away. And at $12 a pop I'm not pissing my money away. YOU want to pay for my multiple viewings &amp time spent? Yeah I didn't think so.<br><br>4) For those invested in Jar Jar Abrams or Georgie The Hutt to save the day forget it. These guys are hard-core leftists as well. If anything Episode 9 will double down on the propaganda drivel.<br><br>5) Oscar noms for this dreck in the technical area. I doubt seriously this film actually deserves the noms much less an actual golden calf...errr...statue. There are probably films out there that I'll never see that are better in these technical areas. The Oscars quit being a legit awards ceremony decades ago. Now it's just a propaganda machine for bubble-people who get rich playing make-believe.<br><br>5) Kudos to the poster who coined the term "Mary Sue &amp The Diversity Crew".

 This movie does not work for me. Too many plot holes. Too many poor character choices. Pool direction. <br><br>The movie does have lots of eye popping visual candy for any audience but when it comes down to the myth and lore for the universe of story we have all grown to love known as Star Wars - it does it quite a dis-service. <br><br>Writer / Director Rian Johnson would have been best served walking the red carpet on opening night flipping all the Star Wars fans the bird and mooning them as he walked into the viewing. When he went on to say he paid no attention to the Force Awakens when writing his next story - it showed the lack of respect for the story being told and more selfish implications of the new trilogy that he has been given (for now). <br><br>Perhaps Force Awakens write and director JJ Abrams can correct what has been done in the 3rd installment of this trilogy. Help us JJ - you may be our "Only hope"<br><br>Not saying you needed to follow what the star wars fans wanted but at least care about the star wars universe.

 Many reasons why The Last Jedi failed. Besides some great action scenes the movie was a total flop. In story dialogue side stories characters and many other issues. If you keep up with the story of Star Wars this is a one time must see. Otherwise pass on this., 2.5,  Seak D, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977075799/, January 27 2018,

 If you are the sort of person who likes lights and colours and noise and your favourite films include Transformers Pirates of the Caribbean or anything by Marvel you will love this film. It is well shot and skillfully directed. In addition the performances are all good to superb. However if you are a true Star Wars fan or an old fart (like me) for whom the original trilogy was a defining aspect of your childhood or frankly if you are a real film fan you are not going to like this. It's not that the film is terrible it's worse than that it's just nothing. It's so stale so politically correct so utterly vacuous and safe. It doesn't say or do anything new or interesting and worse it eschews not only the established SW universe but even the majority of the plot lines established in the previous film. <br><br>To be brief this is a film which asks the viewer to accept that Luke has forgotten the entire rite of passage of the original films and has shut himself off from the Force that he would turn on and try to kill the son of his sister and best friend that Luke is actually a coward and defeatist that the New Order wasn't delayed at all by having their "Death Star" in the last film destroyed and have just taken over the galaxy overnight anyway that gravity exists in space that a person can be blown out of a space ship and simply survive the airless vacuum of space that spaceships run on petrol that a lone Xwing can take out the largest class of ship the New Order has that a pair of fuckwits can get jailed for a parking ticket and end up in the same cell as a master hacker that the all powerful Supreme Leader can be killed as easily that a random girl can suddenly fight with a lightsaber as proficiently as any master jedi that Luke would want to destroy the entire history of the order he pledged his life to that some random girl can master force powers for no reason as well as any Jedi that shields on spaceships only work when convenient to the plot that small fighters can't fly even a short distance from their motherships that large ships simply can't track smaller ones at all that two people can race speeders for miles across a desert before having a massive crash and both pilots will survive and then run back all of the miles they flew in the space of about 4 seconds. <br><br>Are you getting the drift yet? It is poorly written poorly realised nonsensical garbage that is at times as hard to watch as the misplaced humour is hard to stomach. TFA wasn't great but I accepted it as a reboot and an introduction to new characters. However after this awful mis-step I am now totally over SW. I'm not upset or even disappointed just uninterested. SW is dead for me. It finished with RoTJ. Disney can wring the franchise dry of cash until it is the empty husk it seems to now be but it really doesn't matter. This is just nothing it's boredom and apathy in cinematic form. I'm sure that kids will love it get invested and enjoy the merchandise until they hit adolescence and seek some substance in the art they consume - but me from this point I'm out, ni,  Spencer J, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/975578563/, January 27 2018, 
 Stunning visual effects and props design and good acting from Luke Rey and Kylo. However many things in the movie didn't make any sense. I believe they could have done a better job with the transition from old charaters to the new ones I mean they could have given both Luke and Rey a larger screen time to flesh-out their characters and grow. I'm not a long-time SW fan (just watched all the movies maybe 4 years ago) but it felt off when they used the hyperdrive as a weapon and how General Lea tricked death with The Force. Maybe everything was rushed. Honestly I don't have much to look forward to in episode IX., 2.0,  Kurt Louis S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/870637454/, January 27 2018,

 *** Spoiler ALERT ** If you want to see this movie then don't read this review because it has many spoilers.<br><br>*** Seriously it is all spoilers **<br><br><br>Why did they squander so much potential on such a terrible plot/story/nonsense. You had so many great characters with potential but can't figure out how to right a decent story around them? <br><br>So Luke returns as a hermit. I get it. est pupil turns dark and destroys his jedi dojo. But Luke is so frightened of his nephew that he decides on a whim to kill him in his sleep? The son of his sister and best friend? That's not only not "Luke" that is just lazy stupid writing. <br><br>Snoke!!! He has to be the worst Sith ever. Hmm let me just set this light saber beside me. Can't imagine my Sith apprentice would notice it as an opportunity to .....<br><br>Rey is obviously a Mary Sue character. But couldn't you make her story arc somewhere in the realm of believably? Training a couple of days to become a god like Jedi is pretty lame. Time-lapse her progress or something at least if you aren't going to tell the story of her journey.<br><br>Leah. I can't even begin to start. But blasting her out into open space only to have her "force" her way back was awful. The "we are killing an iconic character oh wait she has god like powers so she lived" story arc is something that might be written by a kid in grade school. <br><br>Then there is poor Kylo Ren. The whiniest emo "villian" I have ever seen in a story of any kind. He could be a completely interesting character. Adam Driver the actor portraying him is completely capable of any kind of nuanced complicated villainy. But the story the writing the everything you handed to him makes him not terribly "evil" or dark at all. <br><br>I had high hopes. After Rogue One with the return of Luke with all the great possibilities surely this will be on par with Empire Strikes back. But no. It is hands down the worst episode in the franchise. Not only am I not interested in seeing what happens next I am finished watching any more Star Wars sagas. I would like to get my money and time wasted back on this one., 1.0,  Brian D, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/913382104/, January 27 2018, 
 The attempts at humor were obnoxious. The entire first half of the movie could have been skipped if the Vice Admiral had simply told people what her plan was- or even that she had a plan at all. Luke's character was assassinated. Leia flies in outer space. Snoke was killed with no explanation why he could exist in the first place as an old Dark Side user alive during the time Palpatine was turning or destroying all Force users. <br><br>"Rey from nowhere" brings nothing to the saga which had previously been about the Skywalker family. The entire mythos of the story was thrown out and even mocked in the movie. <br><br>I've been a life-long Star Wars fanatic and after Last Jedi I have absolutely no interest in anything else Disney churns out., 1.0,  derek m, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977075754/, January 26 2018,

 This movie definitely took everything you were expecting to happen with the trilogy and flipped it upside down. Rian Johnson took a great risk with where he decided to take the series and I believe it turned into a good movie. This definitely has a vibe that is very different than any previous Star Wars movie. I personally do wish Luke was portrayed a little differently maybe a little more like the Luke of the original trilogy thought I absolutely LOVE his sass. But this movie kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time extremely excited for what was going to happen next. <br>Now this movie does leave a few questions unanswered but these are questions that can be answered in episode IX.<br>SPOILERS:<br>Luke dies at the very end if you haven't seen or heard that already. I wish he didn't at least not with the timing that he did. However I don't believe he's done yet. Force ghosts are a thing.

 This film was a Star Wars movie in name only. It was the only SW movie in my 40+ year history of enjoying these films on opening weekend that I've ever turned to the people I was with afterwards and put two thumbs down. I was like "what the eff did I just watch because it wasn't Star Wars and that sure as sh*t wasn't Luke Skywalker?". I can appreciate taking the franchise down a different path but not when that path leads directly to a toilet. Many others have stated their dislikes which I completely share and I won't reiterate them in this post. I hated this movie so much that I sold my stock in Disney because if they can't take care of Star Wars then what can they take care of? I don't see how the damage to the franchise can be repaired in the next film.

Using someone else's work to turn it into an harassing pamphlet just because you now own the brand is repugnant and despicable beyond belief.<br>I'm just glad that the authors were so busy in pushing their political agenda that they ended up forgetting about doing a movie.

 What the xxxx did disney do with Luke Skywalker? My Childhood hero turned into a bitter old man who is nothing like the Luke Skywalker of the original series.This film has disappointed me so much. Messy Story lines that don't really matter to the story a weak plot. Flat Characters and not very likable characters The acting is ok and on some parts good but the story is really lousy and not worthy of the name Star Wars.

 No character development very crammed rushed script. TFA wasnt great mainly due to being fairly unoriginal but it had more space and more human connection and emotion. If TFA was a 7 out of 10 I figured with all that was set up and the characters to work with TLJ should of topped Empire but this is a disaster. The script made Finn and Poe seem like bad actors where in Force awakens they seemed pretty good. This movie has no depth no real feeling.

 I loved that that is movie broke the mold for a Star Wars movie. I am a big fan of the franchise and I read the books and comics too. I think that Rian Johnson told the story he wanted to tell and I am a fan of it. I have seen the movie three times. The second time was most enjoyable -- after I had been relieved of my expectations going into the first viewing. The third time around I saw many of the flaws people have pointed out in other reviews. What I like: The movie does something unique and puts all of the main characters through some kind of failure. The movie is about failure and also turns the typical hero trope on its ear. While during the arc of the film we see several characters learn from their mistakes every major character experiences failure at some point during the movie. Failure might make the trip to Canto Bight seem like a waste of screen time. But the ultimate failure of Finn and Rose's mission and what they learned was kind of the point. Certainly the Resistance fails in a massive way by the end of the film. I love this unique theme for a film. It is not a perfect movie. But I have no problem with how it treated Luke Snoke etc. Better than Rogue One. Not as good as Force Awakens. But a great new direction for the franchise., 4.5,  Birger S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/807796365/, January 26 2018, 
 What have they done to Star Wars?<br><br>The Last Jedi takes the Star Wars franchise we know and love and repeatedly rapes it in the backside with a hot iron rod and then when that's all over it pisses on the mangled corpse with Democrat Party anti-white male propaganda. I feel violated for having watched this abortion.<br><br>+Finn was on life support like a week before this movie takes place and now he's in perfect health. Huh?<br>+Leia doesn't swell up and explode in the vacuum of space but rather starts to float back to the ship like Mary Poppins. This same Leia who couldn't save Luke in the original trilogy can now save herself... while being unconscious.<br>+How does one drop bombs on a space ship in space where there is no gravity?<br>+Hyperspace ramming? Really? Where was this convenient cop out when three death stars needed to be destroyed?<br>+The strong and focused Jedi Luke Skywalker of Return of the Jedi is replaced by a cowardly hermit who would rather see the galaxy go to hell than lift one of his freakin' fake prosthetic fingers to help. He has become the sissy beta cuck male liberals want all men to become. Luke claims to have given up on being a Jedi and wants the Jedi order to disappear and yet he's on an island protecting... Jedi texts? Why the hell would he give a map to find him to R2D2 if he wants to be left alone? Does this make any sense? No it doesn't. <br>+Why would Luke refuse to kill his father Darth Vader who slaughtered countless people but be so quick to attempt the murder of his nephew for merely having 'dark thoughts'? <br>+Apparently force ghosts are now gods who can command nature at a whim and cause Jedi texts to burn but no... surely they won't use their newly found god-like powers to save the galaxy from the First Order! <br>+The heroes are *almost* entirely women a lesbian an asian and a black man while the antagonists are all white males. Trying to say something there...?<br>+Meanwhile all of the male Star Wars heroes of yore are being offed one by one. Hans Luke Admiral Ackbar... gone gone gone. I guess the leftists behind this movie really are trying to promote the "future is female" garbage that you see on t-shirts at uber-liberal women's marches and Hillary rallies. Is this to make up for the original trilogy having so few women? You're just gonna kill off all the men now? Is that what "feminism" is about?<br>+On the casino planet Canto Bight the heroes seemed more concerned with abused animals than abused human orphaned slaves. Typical PETA garbage with their messed up priorities. The whole thing with Finn getting tazed by the cops reeks of Black Lives Matter agitprop (Finn only had a bag of Skittles and a bottle of Coca-Cola what are you cops doing to him!). The liberals wont stop until they destroy every single great movie franchise with their twisted back-asswards agenda. Even the damn movie art is shaped like a woman's cooch complete with period blood!<br>+Finn and Rose go to look for a code breaker get thrown in jail over a parking ticket and wouldn't ya know it... in the jail is a codebreaker of equal skill who just happens to be able to let them out of their cell! <br>+Kylo Ren spends most of the movie without his helmet. He was such an intimidating figure when it was wearing it in TFA but Disney would rather have a weak goth/emo villain who looks like Edward Scissorhands. <br>+Snoke the most powerful being in the galaxy who can read minds and link minds together apparently can't read the mind of Kylo Ren as he slices him in half with a lightsaber. What a waste of an interesting character and with no explanation of his backstory. What happened to the rule of two for Sith? Was Snoke even a Sith? What the hell was he then??? Well he's dead now so that's going to remain unanswered. <br>+Rey had ZERO Jedi training and apparently she's more powerful than a Luke Obi-Wan Anakin and Yoda put together. Come the F on princess powers Disney! And how many training sessions did she have with Luke? Three maybe encompassing an hour of total Jedi learning? And now she's ready to save the galaxy with that little experience???? Luke Skywalker had his freaking hand sliced off in battle with Vader for daring to rush his training! But never fear our cute little Disney princess has the magical girl power force and all will be well in the galaxy. <br>+Are we as movie-watchers supposed to care about the whole "Resistance" movement anymore? My goodness there's maybe like 12 of them still alive in the entire galaxy and they want to force their political philosophies and way of life upon the billions and billions of other beings who have either rejected the Rebellion outright or chosen not to support it. The galaxy has made it clear by now that it doesn't want the damn Republic because the Republic continues to fail time and time again. Get the hint already! My goodness the parallels to the Hillary Clinton campaign and its idiot snowflake followers is astounding. <br>+Some slave kid with a broom seen at the end of the film is already more powerful than Rey who is more powerful than Luke.... What a crock.<br>+Knights of Ren? Where are they in this film? What happened to them?<br>+Why didn't Admiral Lesbian Purple-Hair tell Poe of her plans? Just to watch him risk his life and the lives of everyone else in the rebellion? FFS Poe was acting out of legitimate concern and the feminazis behind this movie slap him down and make him look like a fool for daring to question purple hair. <br>+Why did Rose stop Finn from sacrificing himself to save the Rebellion? That was incredibly dumb to put everyone's lives at risk. If Disney princess Rey wasn't able to lift rocks everyone would've been obliterated thanks to Rose's stupidity. <br>+How dare you kill off Admiral Ackbar. Shame!<br>+Now Episode IX is going to be someone who didn't complete their training in the dark side Kylo Ren fighting someone who has next to zero training in the light side of the force Rey. How are they going to make this movie interesting? Are Rey and Ren going to be siblings yet again like Luke and Leia? Their names are so similar maybe. Disney is that dumb to make it so obvious. My guess: It's going to end with Rey turning Kylo Ren to the light side as they fight some unknown dark side villain together who appears out of nowhere then she'll share a big interracial smooch with Finn and spend the remainder of her life dominating Finn with a whip to make the lesbian feminist viewers of the movie have wet panties. The end.<br><br>Anyone who likes this movie deserves to be sent to the pit of misery while anyone who publicly attacks this pile of leftist agenda garbage will forever be a true friend of the crown (dilly dilly!). Beware of the fake 5-star reviews on this site. Any review with five stars that is maybe 2-3 sentences long sounds like it's ripped from a professional movie review capsule written by a Washington Post critic and includes the full names of cast members talking about how they "gave a wonderful performance" is a sham review posted by Disney. Seriously... go look at these 5-star reviews. They're all nearly identical to each other and show no demonstrable knowledge of the movie's plot. Meanwhile many of the REAL reviews are 1/2 to 1 stars and contain lengthy diatribes with actual references to the contents of the movie. We negative reviewers actually watched the film and we truly care that Star Wars has been raped by feminists. <br><br>Riam Jonson and Kathleen Kennedy are worse than Adolf Hitler. Much worse. Sure Hitler gassed a lot of people but these two vile pieces of human garbage DESTROYED STAR WARS! That's an act of unspeakable evil. Please for the love of the Force George Lucas remove this awful film from Star Wars canon and redo the sequel trilogy yourself! You sold us out but there's still time for you to turn from the dark side and make things right.

 Without a doubt the worst Star Wars movie made. The list of wrongs with this movie is endless... Adam Driver's performance and character are the only thing making this movie something other than a complete joke. Rian Johnson absolutely failed with this installment. A scattered aimless plot ( was there one? ) the ridiculous Mary Poppins Princess Leia moment pointless characters ( Snoke Rose ) obvious SJW and Feminist agenda ( ALL of the rebel leaders are women and all of the male characters in the movie are either idiots cowards or trigger happy imbeciles ) The corny lines that were supposed to be comedic just made the movie seem like a bad SNL skit the terrible Yoda hologram bombs that "drop" in space?? the list goes on and on. Even Mark Hamill said that this was not the Luke Skywalker he knew. The only people who like this movie are the type of people who like it JUST because it says Star Wars or people who don't know anything about the previous installments. The only upside of this movie is that now JarJar Binks is no longer the worst part of the Star Wars franchise., 1.0,  Ken T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/923215835/, January 26 2018,

 Overall very good movie. The director had big balls to take the film in that direction and change the horizon of what star wars is.

 The film was amazing. Critics are generally people who get paid to watch films immerse themselves in the craft and understand what makes a good film. It isn't about comparing the film to other films in the franchise. This is about how for example we could compare Mark Hamill's performance in "Star Wars: The Last Jedi" with something like Anthony Hopkins' performance in "The Edge" or another film. Does the film have the elements of a beloved sci-fi film? Maybe not. Does it have the elements of a great film?

 There were some thrilling great parts to this film. Adam Driver is the main star and steals the spotlight with another great performance but some elements of this story just seem to be made up on the spot and don't tie into the Force Awakens or Star Wars as a whole.

 As a fan of Star Wars since I was 6 years old in 1977 this movie hurt my feelings. I have never before walked out a movie and said you know I don't even care anymore. Why do you have to kill all of the original characters to move on with the story? Why do you only have one Jedii in training? And finally why do you treat not answering questions from the first film so flippantly?.

 I'd like to give it zero stars. Terrible writing terrible handling of Luke skywalker. it was visually stunning. no setup as to why Holdo would tell Poe her plan. everything setup in 7 was thrown away. it would have been clever to throw a fwe things away but to literally throw them all away was terrible. watching the "writing" for luke was painful. like the worst version of "don't meet your heros" you could imagine. I love Finn but didn't like his story at all. I think he should have shipped with Poe but instead the cram in a last minute ship with the new mechanic character. i didn't like her character arc either. she lost her sister in a battle and then at one point it seems like all she cares about is freeing animals. uhm ? really? wouldn't you be more focused on avenging your sister? making sure her sacrifice lead to a victory? but nope she forgets all that for a bit and just wants to promote peta. Phasma was wasted again. admiral ackbar was wasted mis-treated . i did like the snoke subversion plot twist and that fight scene. movie was visually amazing but the story was god aweful and it even manages to take away from the OT. just sad. Its star wars so i'll say you should see it. but damn. you should probably get drunk first and expect the worst. worse than episode 2. this is the worst star was out of all 9 of them., 0.5,  John R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/922062718/, January 26 2018,

 Disney had a pile of money to operate with when they decided to buy this from Lucas. They could've done anything. Any of the characters from the extended universe mixed with some new ideas would've been more than fine. What did they do? They proceeded to take acid to the original mythology and replaced our long established characters with cheap imitations. The affirmative action Star Wars with none of the soul and all of the loud visual noise that bludgeoned the viewer into submission. What a garbage franchise written and directed by people who just recently discovered what Star Wars is. A total insult to anyone who chucked money at this corporate monolith the past four decades. Disney basically said "Hey thanks for making this a viable brand but guess what? We no longer want you." <br><br>This movie is everything that's wrong with the modern Hollywood film. Written by people who have no grasp on the material. They tear down the work of people who actually had to use their imagination and replace it with stupid shit that no one cares about. The Duchamp version of Star Wars. Stick to the original trilogy. It's quite apparent we're never going to reach the creative peak the old ones hit.

 Rian Johnson has produced the most original Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back. It is so original that it copies nearly verbatim entire themes and scenes from the movies of the original trilogy. It is so bold that it hints at a lesbian relationship between admiral Holdo and Leia Organa but it does not dare to let them share a passionate kiss as they part. <br>It also lets the legacy characters of Luke and Leia shine so much that the first is described as a deranged coward hiding from his responsibilities and the second is a motionless statue of salt in the middle of the ship's bridge apparently unable to do anything useful. Rian Johnson honors her by transforming her ridiculous death-non-death in the most infamous Internet meme SuperLeia.<br>TLJ develops the new Characters introduced in The Force Awakens further. It develops them so good that we still do not know who the parents of Rey are and why she is so powerful with the Force. The transformation of Rey into Mary Sue is complete now.<br>You can see a direct link from Luke Skywalker at the end of Return of the Jedi a man who as chosen not to fight with a lightsaber but with a lasersword which is omething that does not exist in the Star Wars universe.<br>The problems some people seem to have with TLJ come down to either expectations and/or the narrative structure of the movie. It is a character-driven story so you best focus on the people running aimlessly from scene to scene instead of trying to understand how the hell it is possible to create so many plot holes in a single movie.

 Something is strange with Rotten Tomatoes Calculations. Look at Top critic Matthew Lickona. He rated Last Jedi a 2 out of 5 and Rotten Tomatoes interpreted that as fresh. Also Top Critic Leah Pickett obviously didn't even watch this movie as she describes Luke as a wise and patient teacher of Rey. The only reviews I trust are the fan written reviews.

 The Last Jedi takes many risks for a movie in a 40yr old multi-billion dollar franchise. This alone is to be applauded as many of its ilk are content with treading familiar territory. Rian Johnson has produced the most original Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back. TLJ develops the new Characters introduced in The Force Awakens further while letting the legacy characters of Luke and Leia shine. Especially Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker is portrayed in a intriguing complex and multi-layered way. Hamill gives the performance of his lifetime in a live action movie. You can see a direct link from Luke Skywalker at the end of Return of the Jedi a man who as chosen not to fight with a lightsaber but with love and compassion to Luke at the and of TLJ. Alongside Rey Luke has the other his second hero's journey. The problems some people seem to have with TLJ come down to either expectations and/or the narrative structure of the movie. It is a character-driven story so you best focus on the three triangles of Luke/Rey/Kylo Leia/Poe/Holdo and Rose/Finn/DJ. The central characters have an impressive journey in this movie and after a second viewing the structure becomes much clearer. All in all the best Star Wars movie in a long time on par with TESB., 5.0,  Some highs some lows overall the subtle political stances and convoluted plot elements make it a little disappointing to me still a good movie but a lot of wasted potential, wts,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977074183/, January 25 2018, 
 This is the only Star Wars movie that one screening is enough. When it comes tp home viewing will give it another chance.

 Writer Rian Johnson metaphorically ended the importance of Star Wars lineage and plot continuation when he had his version of Luke toss away his 30 year old light saber like he was discarding trash.

 I absolutely HATED this one... and that is coming from a SW fan that is so die hard that I have seen every other SW movie at LEAST 5 times IN THEATERS. I saw this one only twice... and the second time only because I thought there was no way that it could be as bad as it seemed to be.<br><br>One huge issue was that there were SO many logical problems and flaws with the plot that I just could no longer suspend my disbelief... and that is saying something since I think we can all agree that the original trilogy had its fair share of plot holes. I will briefly touch on what were the ones that I remember from a month ago.<br><br>- Gravity dropped bombs on a space bomber <br>- arcing (nonprojectile) shots in space<br>- ships that slowed down and tilted when they ran out of fuel (seriously... its space guys)<br>- even though there were no force fields (no blue shimmer) the space bomber still had atmosphere and gravity (ship too small to have a grav generator) when the bay doors were open<br>- Lightspeed apparently takes zero time now<br>- Lightspeed can be used to make one ship a super weapon but was never used prior to the very end<br>- Rose saying she spends all day behind pipes and Finn confirmed from 7 as a terrible pilot and yet they can both pilot quite well in the speeder scene<br>- somehow they have Mazs personal number<br>- Poe made literally every wrong decision even started a mutiny and was personally responsible for almost every death in the resistance and yet he keeps getting forgiven<br>- Vice Admiral Holdo stayed on the ship because "someone had to pilot it" when there is autopilot AND she was just standing at the window looking out not even piloting and watched while the first 6 or 7 escape ships got shot down.<br>- Poe called off the assault on the death star rammer when LITERALLY their only plan at that point was to hold out for reinforcements and the cannon could definitely break through the blast door.<br>- Rose and Finn somehow made it back when Rose was passed out and they were stranded in crashed speeders very far from their base and right under the noses of the first order<br>- Rey apparently is good at EVERYTHING with zero training. (makes her a boring character)<br>- Killing off Snoke removed the only imposing antagonist. Kylo has been beaten at every turn so far so he is not threatening. This leads to a much weaker buildup for the final movie. IMO it would have been much more interesting if Rey had given into the dark side and joined Kylo and then Leia and Luke would have to stop them in 9... but Disney doesnt have the balls to make a good girl the bad guy.<br>- Apparently releasing captive animals makes it "all worth it" even though they believe that the fate of the galaxy is in their hands and the animals can easily be recaptured and the damage they did will likely be fixed without too much fuss.<br>- Luke apparently has backslid on character development. All the mistakes he made were lessons he learned in the original trilogy.<br>- AFTER LOSING ALMOST THEIR ENTIRE FORCE AND HAVING BEEN DEALT DEFEAT AFTER DEFEAT ONE OF THE END SCENES IS THE REMAINING FEW RESISTANCE MEMBERS FLYING AWAY IN THE FALCON AND THEY ARE ALL LAUGHING AND TALKING TO EACH OTHER. yea right... that is so unrealistic that it is jarring to watch.<br><br>On top of these I cannot for the life of me fathom how some are hailing this movie as so innovative and fresh... ALMOST EVERY SCENE WAS STOLE DIRECTLY FROM EPISODES 5 OR 6.<br><br>-Emperor palpatine and vader try to turn luke and taunt him showing him the destruction of the rebels<br>-battle of hoth involving speeders against walkers assaulting a base<br>- the Falcon being chased by TIEs and flying around all the beams and jutting pieces of the Death Star II<br>- A search for an old friend/ally who then turns on them (and looks pretty roguish)<br>these sound familiar?? They should because they have direct reskins in the new movie. I was hoping they would do something cool and new with this movie... but they followed in the footsteps of 7 by showing us that they dont care about giving us a good story all they want is to use nostalgia to try and win over the diehard fans like me while using virtue signalling feminist propaganda to try and win over the media and the crazies.<br><br>Screw you Disney. You are turning a beloved franchise into an abomination. Just look at china. They dont have the worship of SW like we do so they see it from a more neutral perspective... and it took them all of a weekend to declare it "Baizuo" (Chinese term for crazy SJW) and remove it from theaters... I may not agree with everything China does but I have to agree here. This movie was a virtue signalling SJW dumpster fire and I hate to say it but I will not be seeing the next star wars movie unless I hear from a lot of people that it is actually good., 0.5,  Colin M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977074024/, January 25 2018, 
 I left the screening of TLJ feeling depressed sick to my stomach and without any desire to see the next film. I thought that perhaps I was suffering from over hype and extreme expectations but after seeing so many similar reviews by other fans it seems clear that there is something fundamentally misguided with the film. This review is simply my personal attempt as a life-long Star Wars fan to process what went wrong.<br><br>For me the largest issue of TLJ is that it misunderstands or ignores the basic Star Wars mythos. Yes Stars Wars is fun escapism. Yes it is about hope and resisting oppression. And yes the new installment needed to pass the torch to a new set of characters whose adventures had to be exciting and interesting in their own right and not just a slavish rehash of the old films. <br><br>But what made Star Wars such an extreme cultural phenomenon was it's foundation on the Power of Myths (literally the title of the book by Joseph Campbell that helped inspire George Lucas). Beneath the fresh and exciting space opera in which George Lucas set his story are deep age-old ideas of heroism good evil and the human journey for purpose that have captivated mankind since our inception. It was about hope but that hope was based on specific tropes and long established ideals. It had shocking surprises but those twist fed into a traditional time-tested story arc. So even after the "state-of-the-art" effects of the 70's-80's faded Star Wars kept a firm grip on our imaginations because it had seeded itself within the larger themes of humanity themes that no matter the cultural or political context remained relevant and inspiring. <br><br>The most recent Episodes 7 and now 8 seem to go for the Star Wars feel but only on a superficial level. There are X-wings and storm troopers aliens and lightsabers and a fight for freedom (sort of). There are great special (digital and practical) effects. Even John Williams is on board. But it is not founded on the same timeless themes and ideas like the hero's journey which has very specific characteristics and arc. Instead it is all a muddle of plot and motif throwbacks contemporary politics and humor and a progressive desire to reinterpret and improve upon basic ideas that have been shared for millennia. <br><br>In short the recent movies are just like any other above-average big-budget movie especially in the mold of the Marvel franchise and rebooted Star Trek films. They have good production teams talented directors and actors and faithfully rabid fan bases. For the casual movie-going experience this is enough. The audience escapes for a few hours has a good time enjoys a few poignant moments some laughs and the studio rakes in millions of dollars especially overseas. There's nothing really wrong with this it's just show business.<br><br>But TLJ feels like such a betrayal because Star Wars like other great enduring films was something more. Not just because we were kids when we first saw it (I enjoyed a lot of films as a kid that I can now see are pretty lame and uninteresting) or had the toys and loved dressing up for Halloween or conventions. It was something more because it drew from the shared human mythology going back centuries a mythology that on the surface can seem childish or simplistic but in the long run deeply resonated beyond its current context. <br><br>TLJ falls short because in trying to up-date the story for the next generation it demands that we let go of forget and revise all that we knew and loved before. Luke Skywalker is more than just Mark Hamill in the right costume (though he did a great job with what he was asked to do in this film). Luke is a personification of the human ideal to find ones identity and destiny in an adventure to save their world from evil. Change this muddy it and he's no longer recognizable. Mark Hamill's character of TLJ is well-acted and conflicted but he's no longer recognizable as Luke Skywalker to those who knew him. He's not on the same mythic journey. His age-old character arc is twisted and conformed to fit a contrived plot twist which should be interesting but ultimately defies and cheapens his previous development. It rewrites his destiny for the sake of a new idea. When Luke tosses away of his old lightsaber and seemingly shrugs his shoulders at his last connection to his father Obi Wan and his life's work its as though we're being told to forget all that he stood for and we believed in. If this was just a momentary struggle in his character development that might be one thing but instead it seems to signal a new modus opandi for the entire new and improved universe.<br><br>And although Luke's portrayal in TLJ is perhaps the most painful and dissonant he is by no means alone. Rey is idealistic but she is not a student growing through her quest. She is more powerful than Luke (with only a stick) and Kylo Ren already. She easily resists the temptations and taunts of Ren and Snoke and finishes the film pretty much how she started it. Luke is not the wise teacher looking to preserve an ancient hope for the galaxy a la Obi Wan or Yoda. He has very little to pass on to Rey or anyone else amidst his own struggles and confusion a sad reflection of modernistic uncertainty and relativism rather than the mythic hope in purpose and destiny . Kylo Ren is a bad guy but his evil is uncertain and queasy. He doesn't know what he's about so while he's is interesting and well-acted his character doesn't resonate or generate much fear. In two movies he's thrown a lot of tantrums but achieved little. Snoke works while ominously all-powerful and all-knowing but that is quickly thrown away in TLJ seemingly for shock value. Neither Finn or Poe fulfill any real trope or thematic purpose. The droids have lost their role as narrators and testaments to the story and instead merely provide convenient solutions and comic gags. <br><br>Even the Force behind everything we're told is something altogether different than we thought both in practical application (now we can teleport and space walk) and meaning (there is no good or evil only balance or evil is just another part of nature or something organic and homeopathic). So the Force too seems unsatisfying and alienating.<br><br>Star Wars fans take flak for seeming to want the same thing over and over again. They are often labeled as whining obstructionists opposing anyone who wants to try something new. It's not that they're against new ships and planets and characters and stories. These are the superficial side the mode of presenting the myth. And yes they must be re-imagined and boundary-pushing just like George Lucas in 1977. His Star Wars was radical and many at the time thought he was nuts. But as radical as Star Wars was in its presentation was its conservatism in its themes and story arc. When Star Wars fans seem to want more of the same it is not more of the specific plot elements or motifs (cantina scenes and cut-off arms) but recognition of the mythological core and characterizations that have stood the test of time.<br><br>Fundamentalism is often ridiculed as being stodgy and out-of-step with its current cultural context but it is often the fundamentalists who endure while those who fail to recognize and maintain their foundational tenets who fade away. TLJ has all the same Star Wars elements but seems to reject or at best misunderstand the story's core of coming-of-age good versus evil guilt redemption and family. The critics seem to be lining up to praise TLJ for the diversity of its cast nods to gender equality shading of absolutes revising past heroes and providing supposed plot twists. There is nothing necessarily wrong with these on their own and they are likely well intentioned. But when these contemporary values ignore and replace the underlying mythos that has sustained Star Wars and legends like it for centuries we can't expect the same lasting impact. The ceremony is all there but it has lost its meaning. <br><br>It may be possible to restore the current series but it will require more careful attention to what truly made Star Wars timeless and a humble willingness to acknowledge the power of old ideas. By all means retell the myth in a new way but don't try to reinvent what the myth stands for or else it will cease to matter. There are stories and ideas that reach far beyond us and our current culture. Rather than change them we should aim to learn from them and allow them to change challenge and ultimately inspire us., 0.5,  Jason M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/943105637/, January 25 2018,

 I can't believe that so many fanboys ripped The Last Jedi apart. I'm glad I went to see it after viewing so many bad reviews. I went into the theater with very low expectations but was pleasantly surprised. Practically all the negative comments that were made save one I disagreed with but that tiny observation was not enough to ruin the experience. Don't believe what the fanboys are saying about The Last Jedi. These are people that take the Star Wars franchise WAY too personal. ITS JUST A MOVIE! And it's fantastic! Trust me nearly every bad comment made about this movie was either wrong or out of context. For instance the "The lightsaber toss behind the back" rage. It wasn't Luke's!! It was Anikan's!! Anyway I loved the 8th installment of this beloved saga., 5.0,  Josh C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977073953/, January 25 2018, 
 Awful. Through this movie and his interviews it's clear Rian Johnson's only aim was to try and create something unexpected. Which he succeeds in doing at the expense of the star wars universe. Cheap laughs and cheaper story. Visually breathtaking however., ni,  Isaac J, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/925983964/, January 25 2018, 
 Star Wars the last jedi was the greatest bomb that ever slowly blown up in my face.Rei accomplished nothing and didn't grow at all during the entire movie.Finn and his accomplice were useless they failed to do anything critical.Kylo was the one saving grace of the movie even though he got shafted during the fight with the imperial guard.Imperial guard are the best of the best they are chose among the best storm troopers and then tortured to be the best.Finally they have to kill everyone else in their class to prove their loyalty and show they are the best.Rei dispatched them rather easily while Kylo struggled even though he had more training then Rei.Sadly Luke was made weak so Rei can appear stronger and the sad thing Luke should have not even tried to beat Rei.Rei lifted the boulders with practically no training while Luke had to train in order just to pick up a few rocks under the training of Yoda., 0.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977073947/, January 25 2018, 
 There is not one thing I enjoyed about this movie. They tried to force in too many plot lines with some of the dullest characters in any sci-fi film while trying to teach us real world values. Felt like this was a sequel to Wing Commander or Battlefield Earth. If this is the director for the next franchise I will not be watching., 1.0,  Garret S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/784423474/, January 25 2018, 
 Not a particularly terrible film as some would suggest but definitely not a very good one as others suggest either. It's kind of mediocre overall which is really not great for a franchise known for its Epic styled storytelling.<br><br>If you want me to get more detailed with a few spoilers in my review then I'll start with the good things first. The movie had great special effects where you couldn't even tell so many of it was fake and I had to see a behind the scenes feature to understand how much of it was actually just shot in one giant warehouse studio. The music by John Williams while not his finest work is still splendid as usual. The fight scene with Rey and Kylo vs The Praetorian Guards was pretty cool. The space battle dogfights were fun to watch. Kylo Ren got more character development to the point where he might be more anti-hero than he is villain. That was about it really.<br><br>Now let's do what was wrong. It had too many plot holes such as why the Starships couldn't just hyper speed around in front of the resistance. The story moved too slowly and went practically nowhere with certain subplots. At times it felt like they were trying to tell some underlying political message about capitalism being evil for funding war and how animals need to be saved. Their was too much forced humor at times when I thought the mood was supposed to be serious. The characters were dull stereotypes of an old master refusing to practice kungfu anymore (or the force in this case) gifted student who knows everything and ends up teaching the master maverick from top gun feminist commander who doesn't tell her officers her plan because she doesn't like them Asian fangirl sleezy scoundrel who is totally trustworthy for some reason. I could go on with everything that's wrong with them especially Luke (Jake) Skywalker but then this review would be twice as long and it's all already been said by others. My biggest problem with most of the characters is that they get no real development like they did in the last film and some of them like Finn for example completely ignored their character arcs from the previous Episode. Finally killing off the big bad villain that they were hyping up without even specifying a word about who he was that was a terrible move to make. Now you don't even have main villain set up for your last film in this trilogy. Kylo Ren is supposed to be it now but he certainly doesn't feel like it nor does he command the gravitas to be truly seen as one like Vader Maul and Dooku were. As I said earlier he's a better antihero than villain and can't carry a film on his own as such. General Hux will likely betray him and take over the villain role but this film portrayed him as nothing more than a sniveling rat so he's even less epic.<br><br>The whole move overall feels like a Star Wars fan-fiction film but with an enormously high budget. If this is what I can expect from the Episode 9 then I really don't intend to ever see it in theaters again. It was a waste of money really., 2.5,  Jesse Y, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977073879/, January 25 2018,

 When I went to theaters I did it only for a friend. I was thinking: not another Star Wars. Even though I did enjoy the last two I am usually very sceptic about franchises that continue to live up the hype.<br><br>Well I was proven wrong. Rian Johnson managed to make something completely new. He gave the heart and soul of the movie to their actors. And that was absolutely the right thing to do. Especially the story surrounding the astonishing Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley as well as Mark Hamill clearly the coolest supporting actor in 2017 is very well told. Without completely losing the franchise the film added something new some more religious or philosophical aspects. <br><br>To me it was the most 'different' Star Wsrs of all time and I can totally see why it left many fans of the franchise disappointed. But similar to Blade Runner earlier that year Rian Johnson brought Star Wars to a new level a less entertaining one but a version that is full of quality and sense.<br><br>M.E.G., 5.0,  Michael G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977073854/, January 25 2018, 
 The movie misses lots of opportunities to tell more of the story and add depth to the characters. It does not seem to find the right balance between humour and solemnity and often times shows utter disrespect towards the prequels. While it is eager to fade out the old heroes (and their legacy) it fails to make us attach to or care about the new ones. Eye-candy was okay though., 2.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977073822/, January 25 2018,

 This film is a disappointment. <br>- It hurts to see how Disney put political subplots in this film by force f.e. feminism or Chewbacca and the vegetarian incentive scene <br>- This film lacks of story writing as Ep. 7. F.e.: The casino scenario was an unnecesary filler and the spaceship hunting worth for a 30 minutes episode.<br>- The caracters did not make any developments/tiny sidesteps or grew. F.e. Rey is still a Mary Sue<br>- The film's logic is aweful. F.e. Luke Skywalker is probably THE most iconic hero in the film history and his backward thinking and his death were caused cheaply Snoke is still unknown and his dead has no big impacts because there was never a history to him Leia making the Superman-Move<br>- Disney destroys loved characters cheaply and replaces them with unpersonal ones: f.e. Admiral Ackbar's Death. He would have earned the ship's destroying move and not Captain Purple Unknown.<br>One last sad thing: Now there are qualified Regisseurs and politicians but no good story tellers. George Lucas handed out a possible script which was apparently not given much credit. The EU had so much good output! Timothy Zahn with Mara Jade! Jaina Solo! and Thrawn! The Yuuzhan War Conflict had been a very good Triology f.e.. So much development on this franchise grabbed in the next garbage tin. In contrast people gets popcorn cinema which is worth 1 look but not for more. This franchise is dead.<br><br>Only 3 things are positive at this film: John Williams epic music Mark Hamill's performance and luckily no 5th Death Star.

 NOTE: Apparently RottenTomatoes doesnt count 1/2 star or zero star ratings make sure you give this movie ONE STAR to be counted. There is something REALLY fishy going on with the reviews on this movie. Disney is DEFINATELY paying or influencing the reviews. MAKE YOUR VOICE COUNT AGAINST THIS TERRIBLE MOVIE.<br> <br>Review:<br><br>I remember watching The Phantom Menace as a 17 year old when it first came out and thinking "wow there is no way any future Star Wars movie could possibly be worse than this".<br><br>But the universe in all its infinite wisdom &amp patience just laughed and nearly 18 years later an took the older wearier and more tired version of me and subjected him to this abortion of a film.<br><br>Where to begin? let me try to go in order:<br><br>1) Opening space battle: despite losing the Death Stars to small fighters and having fought the Rebellion for 30+ years the First Orders commanders are utterly unprepared when a single fighter manages to sneak past their big canons and severly damage their biggest dreadnought. Snoke was apparently unaware his capital ship that he is on now has a device that can track the Rebel fleet through hyperspace. Apparently the Galaxy Far Far away does not bother with gravity and vacuum as the Rebel bombers literally "drop" bombs "down" in space. Poe made a prank call to open up the movie.... HILARIOUS right!??<br><br>2) Plot : what in the name of all that is holy was the point of that IDIOTIC Finn/Asian chick side quest? Not only did the out of place Casino planet fee straight out of a James Bond movie and UTTERLY took me out of the film the entire side quest was COMPLETELY POINTLESS and served no purpose other than to give the two minority characters something to do. And when the hell did Rose fall in love with Finn? In the in-universe few HOURS they were together? And if the whole quest was to get in contact with a super rare Code Breaker (too bad they dont have R2 D2) what are the chances they would just HAPPEN to be locked in with an equally competent code breaker just in time to escape together? <br><br>3) Excessive SJW/Feminist/Political correctness. If I walk into a room and theres me (middle eastern) an African American an Asian a Jew and a gay person (all mixed genders) great! No problem. Its when its artifically shoved down our throats and forced its when it becomes an issue. Rose has no reason for existing other that to have an Asian character and fill in the diversity quota. She adds exactly zero to the plot and her removal would make no difference what so ever. Admiral Holdo is in the most ham fisted literal sense the purple haired physical manifestation of modern day toxic feminism. She literally has purple hair and her entire purpose to is put the "mansplaining" hot shot Poe in his place and to show that despite her being completely and utterly stupid and irrational by any standard she really isn't at all and that this proves that all women really are rational even when they are not. And its just men keeping them down! Speaking of which apparently all competent leaders in this new Star Wars are women and all the bumbling incompetent ones are white stuffy men.<br><br>4) The "hyperspace ram" scene. Oh my god this single scene just made the entire Star Wars saga completely and utterly irrelevant:<br><br>A New Hope: "Sir we just analyzed the Death Star plans and devised a risky assault plan....<br>"Just hyperspace ram it"<br>ESB: "Sir our troops are assembled and ready to commence the ground assault against the Rebel base...."<br>"Just hyperspace ram the Shield Generator then hyperspace ram the Rebel base"<br>Return of the Jedi : "Sir the Death Star is just ahead and we are preparing our fleet to...."<br>"Just hyperspace ram the Death Star"<br>"But sir its protected by an energy shield from the Forest Moon of Endor"<br>"Hyperspace Ram the Shield generator then hyperspace ram the Death Star"<br>Rogue One: "We have the Death Star plans but we need to deactivate the shield in order to be able to transmit it to the...."<br>"Just hyperspace ram the shields until they are.... actually we can just hyperspace ram the Death Star anyways. I guess we dont need those plans after all ok guys lets go home"<br><br>Also: why didn't "Admiral" Holdo wait until the very LAST REBEL ship to hyperspace ram the Capital ship of the New Order? She sacrificed like what a dozen Rebel ships before she apparently came up with that brilliant idea? I'm guessing the purple hair dye seeped into her brain or maybe it was just the patriarchy holding her down. Who knows?<br><br>5) Luke Skywalker. Now here is a man who at the tender young age of his early 20s was plucked out of obscurity from a remote desert planet and despite everyone and their mothers telling him otherwise decides that Darth Vader the notorious mass murderer and the Emperor's right hand man had some good in him and he bravely went and confronted him not once but TWICE. Where is this hero? Apparently broken and defeated because a barrel chested angsty teenager got a little mad at him forcing him to abandon his friends family and all he has ever fought for and sulk like a coward milking some kind of space cows. Fruthermore whats the point of the ghost projection at the end if he was going to die anyways? Why not go there as a man worthy of the Luke Skywalker legend?<br><br>6) Rey "Mary Sue". Please keep in mind that in the in-universe timeline Mary Sue was at best a week removed from her escape from Jakku. In that short amount of time somehow she manages to 1) defeat Luke skywalker in an impromptu melee 2) Defeat Snoke's Elite bodyguards in a grossly over matched setting use the Force competently enough to defeat Kylo Ren who has presumably been training since childhood and outfly trained TIE Fighter pilots among many other super human feats. Anakin Skywalker must be jealous.<br><br>7) The entire plot revolves around the FO fleet slowwwwly crawl up to the escaping Resistance fleet. First of all why does light (laser beams) "lose power" over the distance of a few kilometers in vacuum? And since when do Star Wars ships "use fuel" when in the still canonical cross section books even the oldest Republic Era capital ships were powered by "massive fusion generators that generate more power than a star"? Just to serve a contrived and boring plot point and give a movie something to make it last 2 hours?<br><br>8) The entire Resistance is apparently comprised of a few hundred people. For an entire galaxy of quintillion beings. Apparently the Resistance capital ships have a population density less than that of your average crack house. Just how 12 is Rian Johnson exactly?<br><br>8 ) Snoke.... why? Space Leia... why? The third leg on those Rebel speeds on the planet Crayt that create a very visually distinct red trail easily trackable by the enemy....why? The resistance keeping the base door open until the last second causing needless casualties....why?<br><br>The entire existance of this movie which removed any and all interesting characters and mysteries (Snoke Reys parents Luke etc) introduced in Force Awakens. Why?<br><br>In short.... congratulations Universe. You win again.<br><br>Not just the worst Star Wars movie ever but honestly just one of the worst movies in general.<br><br>Rian Johnson is just an edgy douche bag who clearly enjoys taking what he knows people like and expect and just going the complete opposite way just to be a contrarian jack ass. If that's all Disney wanted they could have just made Luke Skywalker be the leader of a group of space faring Force using Unicorns who are the reincarnated Jedi masters of the past and shoot lasers out of their horns. Even less people would have expected that so it HAS to be good right?<br><br>Kathleen Kennedy is a well know hardcore feminist idiot. Now that old white dude Lucas is not the boss anymore Kathleen is having a field day shoving her toxic neo-feminist garbage down our throats.<br><br>Please dont support this film. Don't support Disney. They need to learn their lesson and not be the arrogant corporation they are. RT is not calculating the REAL scores of this film correctly. Its audience approval is WAY less than 49% and the fake "five star" reviews are barely one or two sentences long.

 The problems with the this film are too numerous to count but here's a list of ones which stick out to me:<br><br><br><br>DERIVIATIVE STORY: <br><br>Many claim TLJ doesn't follow the structure of Empire Strikes Back and is therefore more "original" than TFA... Hmmm?? Lets see...<br><br>[1] Our main protagonist goes to an isolated planet to find an old Jedi Master and learn about the Force from him. <br><br>[2] On said planet our hero experiences a hallucination/vision in a place that is strong with the Dark Side.<br><br>[3] Meanwhile the rebels are being chased through space by a much more powerful imperialist force.<br><br>[4] Some of our heroes go to a flashy luxurious location where they encounter a mysterious individual who appears to "help" them but then betrays them to the imperialist bad guys. <br><br>[5] There's a big Ground Battle on a WHITE planet where the Rebels use TRENCHES to fight AT-AT Walkers. <br><br>[6] At the end of the film the Rebels having suffered a major setback are shown flying off in a ship. <br><br>Despite all this Copy &amp Paste imitation TLJ feels NOTHING like a Star Wars film because its tone characters themes and values are as shallow as a Transformers or Marvel comic-book movie. <br>TFA may have been just as derivative of New Hope but at lease it remained true to the spirit of Star Wars!<br><br>PLOTHOLES: <br><br>Too many to count so I'll just stick to the Finn/Rose ones:<br><br>[1] Rose &amp Finn find "Codebreaker" (wearing a distracting white tuxedo like a 007 Parody) but are thrown in jail where they "just happen" to meet a prisoner with exactly the same skill-set?? WTF?!<br><br>[2] Said prisoner just casually opens cell-door and walks out... Why the hell didn't he do this earlier??<br><br>[3] Rose sets an animal free glibly stating "Now it was worth it!" while completely ignoring CHILD SLAVES they just met!<br><br>[4] In the Crait battle the ski-ships are called off but Finn continues fllying toward the canon... until Rose knocks him down... How is this physically possible? Finn was at full-speed... Rose was flying the opposite direction and had to do a 180. How did she get anywhere near him let alone catch up with him??<br><br>[5] They crash right in front of the AT-ATs yet not one of them blasts them?<br><br>[6] Rose says "We don't fight to kill those we hate but save those we love." WHAT?! Thats EXACTLY what Finn was doing! Saving the ones he loved by destroying the canon that was about to blast the cave! If Rey and Luke hadn't turned up Rose would have just single-handedly ENDED the Rebellion! Her illogical "bumper sticker wisdom" makes no sense!<br><br>And these are the Finn &amp Rose plot-holes!<br><br><br>CONTINUITY:<br>Or lack of it... <br><br>[1] At the end of Episode 6 the Empire was finished and the Emperor was dead... In Episode 7 the 'Empire' is back and there's a new 'Emperor' in Snoke. Since J.J. gave no explanation for this we expected Episode 8 to address how this happened or at least explain who Snoke is... Nope! Johnson just kills Snoke off! No explanation as to who the hell he was! <br><br>[2] When/How did Snoke seduce Kylo to the darkside? Never mind... he's dead. <br><br>[3] How did Maz come to possess Luke's lightsaber which fell in Cloud City? Who cares!<br><br>[4] Who were the Knights of Ren? Doesn't matter! We'll just never mention them again! <br><br>[5] What are these Sacred Jedi Texts? They showed them in both TFA and TLJ but they play no part in the story except Luke wanting to burn them like some Communist/Fascist. <br><br>[6] What about the rest of the Galaxy? What happened to the Galactic Capital of Coruscant? How much of the New Republic still exists? How much does the First Order Control? These big geopolitical questions are completely ignored.<br><br>[7] How did Leia become such a powerful Force user? As a Skywalker we knew she was Force-sensitive but if you're going to show her do something as unbelievably ABSURD as flying through space (!) at least have some explaination!<br><br><br>DIVERSITY:<br>There's a BIG difference between authentic organic diversity and contrived pandering to identity politics. This film represents the latter by shoehorning in characters who serve no purpose other than box-ticking a demographic. <br><br>Obvious example is Rose whose whole subplot with Finn ends up serving no purpose in the story whatsoever. She's a "token Asian" designed to appeal to Hollywood's 2nd biggest market: China. This of course failed on a massive scale because TLJ made less than HALF of what TFA made there. <br><br><br>Overall this movie was just a DISGUSTING INSULT to both the Star Wars legacy and the audience.<br>Johnson and Kennedy should hang their heads in SHAME!, 1.0,  Joffrey L, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977073419/, January 25 2018, 
 Completely throws off the series yet again Star Wars has become a disjointed mess and switching directors yet again was a cowardly move born from a lazy production team.

 Setting aside the blatant political stuff this movie seems to be a commercial for <br><br>I think the criticism of the criticism that it's just a bunch of fanboys that are unhappy they didn't get what they wanted is unwarranted. They received a beautifully made Star Wars film with many references to past movies. Many of the original cast members have returned to reprise their roles. The issues go beyond that they consist of continuity problems and plot holes that are just too glaring to be overlooked<br><br>The force Awakens set up the story by asking several questions who are Rey's parents? what happened to Luke? who is Snoke? what part will the Knights of Ren play? And it left us with Snoke requesting Kylo be brought to him to finish his training while Rey appears before Luke to start her training. The Last jedi answers these questions with none of that matters and neither Kylo or Rey will receive any substantive training. Not only that but there's no customary year or two gaps between these two Episodes. Last Jedi rewinds back a bit into the Force Awakens and changes the Rey handing Luke the Saber scene. While the Resistance and First Order have suddenly found themselves in an entirely different situation. <br><br>Lets look at the position the Resistance has found itself in to get away from the First Order they hyperspaced to the middle of nowhere and they are low on fuel. Maybe it would of made more sense to hyperspace close to somewhere they could of refueled? (Since they didn't know they would be followed.) Now they find out that they can be tracked through hyperspace and they end up on the end of Hux's string. A string Hux decides to hang on to while he slowly follows them waiting for them to run out of fuel instead of just hyper spacing closer and finishing the job. <br><br>Now we come to General Holdo's ultra-secret (plot contrivance) plan to fly along on the end of Hux's string and secretly send the transports to an old rebel base since they are tracking the larger ship and the transports will go unnoticed. (More on this a little later.) She keeps this plan a secret from everyone even when point blank asked if she even had a plan which leads to Po concocting his own plan to sneak into Snoke's ship and turn off the tracker. When Holdo finds out that Po's team was conducting this little excursion she is outraged (apparently she doesn't like people holding back important vital information.) <br><br>When Finn and Rose are betrayed by the 'code breaker' inside Snoke's ship not only does he sell them off he seems to relay Holdo's plan to Hux which Hux quickly acts on by targeting the unnoticed transports. So where did the 'code breaker' hear Holdo's plan? Since at this point in the story apparently only Holdo and Leia knew of it and Leia was unconscious. Speaking of which Leia gets blasted out into the cold void of space and not only survives but uses the force to fly back to the mother ship. This is one of several previously unseen force powers we are introduced to in this movie. We get Astral projection and mind texting force ghosts calling lightning from the sky but no real lightsaber battles. (Lucas had planned at one point to have Vader do a force controlled spacewalk but his helmet/suit would have kept him alive in space.)<br><br>We do get to see Luke's astral projection appear to reconnect with Leia and confront Kylo and have a pseudo fight with Kylo to only die afterward. Which begs the question why not just have Luke heed Leia's call for help and come to Crait and be struck down ala Kenobi? Then you wouldn't need to create a new force power for no apparent reason. <br><br>When it comes to Characters this film misses the core principles of what made the original movies popular with fans. Technically episodes I through VI are a bildungsroman on Anakin Skywalker and his fall and ultimate redemption. Then to a lesser degree the story of Luke and Leia and their journey as extensions of his story. These stories are about struggle failure and learning. Striving to overcome insurmountable odds and at times with great loss. We get none of that with Rey or Kylo. Rey has no real struggle she seems to need no training and can just do whatever happens to be needed at the time with little or no effort. Often she is called a 'Mary Sue' but that may be a misleading moniker as that often just refers to a strong leading female role. The real criticism might be better termed as 'god moder' meaning a character in fiction who for no apparent reason is just better at everything than everyone else with no struggle or need to learn this can be male or female. <br><br>Luke is framed in such a manner that contextually he betrays every aspect of his character. He wouldn't leave his aunt and uncle when Ben wanted him to follow him to Alderan even though it was everything he wanted. He forced Han to assist him in saving the Princess because it was the right thing to do. He took part in a 'suicide mission' on the Death Star because they needed him even influencing Han to change his perspective and ultimately help the Rebel cause. He kept his promise to Yoda and returned to complete his training (yes he actually had to be trained) after leaving to rescue his friends. He walked into Jabba's palace alone to rescue his friend Han. And he stood before the Emperor threw down his lightsaber and told him that he had failed because he wouldn't strike down the evilest man in the Galaxy because he still sensed good in him. Now we are to believe this same character gave up on everything including his friends because he sensed evil in his young nephew and almost murdered him in his sleep. He doesn't want to be found but left a map to his whereabouts just in case. <br><br>Rose and the Code Breaker didn't need to exist at all and only served to continue the plot contrivance derived from Holdo's secret plan. The entire Canto Blight sequence the insertion into Snoke's ship and their capture and escape could be cut from the film and it wouldn't change a thing. If Leia hadn't been rendered unconscious Holdo wouldn't need to exist. If they just needed someone to kamikaze into Snoke's ship they could have used Admiral Ackbar since they killed him off anyway. R2-D2 C3PO and Chewbacca are completely underutilized. Po and Finn are both made to look foolish. <br><br>The stars/heroes of the movie are Rey Leia Rose and Holdo. <br><br>A lot of fans are left with not caring what happens in Episode IX but based on the precedents the Last Jedi has established I can assume we will see an astral projected Rey defeat Kylo and the First Order using an army of unstoppable force Ghosts just lightning frying everything in their path., 2.0,  Jason T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977074492/, January 26 2018, 
 I found the humour distasteful (example: dribbling blue milk Luke) the politics dubious (example: Why does the whitest male member of the resistance inherit leadership from Leia when she's healthy and able?) and the continuity poor (example: If Rey is nobody how come Kylo Ren had heard "so much" about her in episode XII?).

 Many Characters Old &amp New All Fighting For Screen-Time Leaves Us Chopping &amp Changing Being Pulled So Many Places At Once. It Is A Struggle To Take It All In But It Did Not Leave Me Disappointed. Many Action Sequences Rescues Loves Interests Losses Defeats &amp Triumphs All Culminate For A Fantastic Adventure Ride. The Swashbuckling Nature Of This Saga Builds Characters Further But Some Characters Have So Little Back Story (Snoke For Instance) It Is Hard To Understand How The Federation (&amp Dark Side) Ever Became So Powerful Again?? (With Dreadnoughts &amp Super Star Destroyers Etc) I Thought More Would Be Explained On This But Other Than The Luke / Kylo Fall-Out Argument At The Temple There Is Nothing Further Added..It's A Bit Disappointing Because Then All Hell Breaks Lose When Characters We Know Little To Nothing About All Start Either Being Knocked Off Or Become Incredibly Powerful &amp Rise Up Against This Almighty Power. You Cannot Just Ride The Story On The Back (History) Of Luke &amp Leia's Demise With No Further Depth To Any Other Characters We Are Expected To Adopt In This New Saga. So The Saga Loses Steam Here &amp All The CGi Character Cameo's By Chewie C3PO &amp R2D2 Cannot Add In Enough Weight-Laughs But It Is Still A Quite Enjoyable Ride.

 So much talk of it being a divisive film. and whether you love it or hate it that fact is certainly true. <br><br>While (and seemingly even more so in this day and age) you can't please all of the people all of the time perhaps there is something to be said for at least having a punt at it. <br><br>This film was always going to split audiences and fans down the middle after the direction and choices were made to take the story the way that it has now gone and although there are aspects of it that are certainly well polished and do invoke elements of the original saga that it owes its creation to ultimately it has done something for me which even the prequels could not... It has finally ended my childhood love affair for the Star Wars saga. <br><br>I can completely understand why many love this latest episode and I am not going to bad mouth it for the various reasons that many others have I will simply say that it has lost its magic and wonder on a very personal level for me individually. <br><br>I will always hold the originals in that special place we keep safe for things that affect the fabric of yourself and I am sure that among the slew of future releases there will be something in there that I enjoy but I think the future will leave me regarding these as simply slickly made modern sci-fi flicks that for are now nothing more and nothing less to me than exactly that rather than the rip-roaring space opera that a long time ago in a galaxy far far away meant something so very special to me and many many others. <br><br>I genuinely hope that the new films bring that same enjoyment to a new generation as the OT did for mine and without any bitterness hope that they also have the opportunity to see them concluded in a way that they would like to see their own heroes walk off into the sunset. <br><br>I can't stress enough that I am glad that for so many this was something special but can't help but ponder how the original Star Wars would be thought of 40 years later if only half of the viewers were at all amused.<br><br>Star Wars never belonged to me I have no right complaining about the directions that characters now take and how new plots unfold as it was never my property to play with but there was a certain magic in those films that connected with me and which now seems crucially missing. I have gotten older as have the earlier films and so to has the world in general so I guess maybe it is long past time to pass on that particular torch and if that was the ultimate goal of The Last Jedi it has been wholly successful. I wish the films the story and the future fans all the best but this is no longer a journey that I will be accompanying them with., 1.5,  metatherion m, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977029929/, January 26 2018, 
 Some great CGI but a poorly written movie with far too many sub plots that feel unnecessary and make the film far too long with no real payoff or impact on the main plot of the film. The Last Jedi has done far more harm to the Star Wars franchise than any of the prequels ever did.<br><br>Without spoiling this movie it simply undoes many of the story arcs set up in the previous movie: The Force Awakens and the main underlying theme in this movie seems to be that none of the story or lore from any previous movie matter. The whole point of a franchise like Star Wars is the continuation of the story. It is without a doubt the worst of the Star Wars movie if you consider only the plot and don't take the visuals in to account which are to its credit very good., 2.0,  Wil , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/973149205/, January 26 2018,

 I think Disney will have to remove Kathleen Feminazi Kennedy and that excuse of a director Rian Fuckface Johnson for the harm they intentionally did to a Disney property which costed them 4 billion dollars.<br>They introduced a completely useless chinese character just to lure more chinese viewers to the theaters and they failed miserably. The movie was completely pulled from cinemas after very few days of screening chinese most upvoded comment being "the whole film really insults the IQ of its audience".<br>Disney's media power in China did not prove as big as in America and Europe where it threatened professional critics or plainly paid them to write positive reviews.<br>The movie has been publicly criticized even by feminists for misrepresenting their true values of gender equality versus toxic and sexist female-supremacy and male-belittling.<br>Don't be fooled. Kennedy selected Rian Fuckface Johnson a very poor writer and an even poorer director with no experience with big saga movies just because he promised to do everything she asked him. <br>Moreover the Pareto Law (20/80 Rule) says that every single company in the world including Disney owes its success to the 20% loyal customer base which generates 80% of the company's revenue. If we focus on Disney's market regarding Star Wars that 20% loyal customer base is mainly composed by middle-aged wealthy white men. Heterosexual middle-aged wealthy white women are the only significant variation.<br>Kathleen Kennedy intentionally (have no doubt after hearing her say "The Force Is Female!" - BTW how sexist is that statement???) slapped the loyal customer base of the Star Wars franchise right in the face with The Last Jedi so Disney can expect 80% losses from the next installments of the franchise. I for sure will not give Disney any more money for anything regarding Star Wars.<br>I frankly doubt Disney will be happy with losing such a stratospheric amount of money so I hope that someone at Disney will stop that evil feminazi from vandalizing something that could easily be called a treasure of American and western pop-culture.<br>By now Disney is backing up the president of Lucasfilm by stating that she and Johnson have done a great job but when the sky will start tumbling down the two of them will be fired unceremoniously.<br>Not that this could make a difference anymore. <br>Disney's Star Wars is not Star Wars anymore.<br>Star Wars canon comprises 6 movies episodes I to VI. Rogue One can easily be considered part of the canon too. The two abominations defecated by Disney break so many rules of the original Star Wars universe that they deliberately choose not to belong to the canon.<br>In regard to Disney's Star Wars therefore we all should start renaming their movies like "Star Wars DAU - The Force Awakens" and "Star Wars DAU - The Last Jedi" DAU being the acronym for Disney Alternate Universe., 1.0,  Vanessa B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977074341/, January 26 2018,

 Based on seeing this movie... I don't believe I'll ever go to the cinema to watch another Star Wars ever again. So so SO many plot holes and "I don't understand how or why or what just happened this makes no sense"<br><br>I've thought long and hard about the 'positive' reviews out there and can't understand how they concluded 5 star reviews. Sure if they ignore 5 to 8 gaping plot holes poor humor almost throughout (about 2 jokes land) 4 or 5 lucky coincidences that help drag the story along (I mean seriously what was the point going to the casino planet just to get imprisoned just to meet a random person that you're not looking for who might help but doesn't) ignore turning BB-8 into a crap clowny character with gold coin machine gun / smashing its head into computer to fix it / to bumbling into walls whilst undercover...<br><br>I want to go on but there's just too many moments that make this a terrible movie.

 First I will start with why I gave it three stars. The good stuff Luke's return from darkness. He redeems him self and shows how powerful he had become. He sees his setting suns he talks to Master yoda and yoda once again teaches him a lesson. Chewbacca is always a Star. So him making his grand entrance to Luke's earned one star all on its own. And of course the power of the women. <br>Here is what was horrible. And it was a lot of the movie. The side story of Finn and Rose. And don't get me wrong I like Finn I just didn't like the direction he was taken In this movie. And Del Toro's character was pointless and silly. The stuttering thing he did was contrived and embarrassing. The Guardians of the Galaxy style space walk. Uhm. Space Mary Poppins anyone??? It was dumb. The whole movie was haptic. It was disjointed and uncomfortable. There was little cohesion in it at all. I am only hoping that episode ix can redeem it.

 Women are superior. Colored people are superior. Animals deserve to be saved from slavery and cruelty. Children do not. The enemy is fascist and of course is white and male and stupid.

Wealth is bad except for Kathleen Kennedy Rian Johnson and the other millionaires who produced this mess who by the way could easily be found among the gamblers at Canto Bight. Disney lured lots of people into the theathers with a mix of deceptive trailers and paid critics but this trick can only be done once.

 Second in a trilogy of movies which seem intent on making the 6 which came before irrelevant the Last Jedi seems to be an attempt at simultaneously slapping JJ Abrams frustrating fan plot predictions through cheap and jarring directional changes and shoving agendas so far down the viewers throat that the movie can be considered a meal substitute. Worst of all is that the agenda pushing comes at the expense of the character integrity of the heroes from the first 6 movies. Characters like Luke seem to have suffered from personality changing traumatic brain injuries such that our determined (to the point of converting Vadar on his death bed) master duelist jedi master has become a cowardly hermit so unskilled as to be beaten by someone who has a couple days self training with a lightsaber and is willing to murder his apprentice at the first sign of temptation. This is just one example. As if such blatant disregard for the foundation of the story this movie supposedly builds on is not ugly enough the plot of this film is exasperatingly full of plot holes.

 Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a great... example of why Star Wars needs to be taken away from Disney and given back to the fans. In fact this movie has convinced me that the only character worth salvaging is Poe. The Last Jedi tries to portray everything Poe does as arrogant and wrong yet he's the only one making the sensible calls in a desperate war. This movie shows me the writers don't understand the scenarios they themselves set up., 0.5,  Nicholas B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976757370/, January 25 2018, 
 Worst Star Wars ever second maybe to Attack of the Clones. Can't believe they messed this one up so badly. How can so many people involved in making the next installment of such an important franchise not see problems in this script...or in the rough cut... I have a loss for words. I'm just disappointed. They're not making these films for people who love a good story anymore. They're making them for children which is exactly how every single character acts in the film. The subplots go nowhere the tone is unimaginative and never too serious characters like Finn Rey and Poe have virtually no character development Luke is neither a hero nor a mentor character (he's just...sad) Laura Dern (playing Admiral Holdo) simply doesn't fit in the Star Wars universe - I'm sorry. Additionally several plot points previously set up in TFA are either flat out ignored/replaced/or summed up in very underwhelming-sweep-it-under-the-rug ways there were jokes and words that don't feel like they would happen in the Star Wars universe (I mean "godspeed" and "forte"? come on) and an entire CGI-heavy 'Casino Land' that seems like an irrelevant subplot island of the worst kind reminiscent of Pod Racing in TPM. So many more things... but over all just awful. Even if I try to forget everything I know about Star Wars and then look at TLJ I would almost consider it an okay Disney movie but when reality hits and I consider the legacy that precedes it TLJ is just a terrible embarrassment on the Star Wars family tree., 0.5,  Nathan S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976959182/, January 25 2018, 
 Terrible. A movie that at once rehashes Empire Strikes Back (Dagobah Hoth Yoda etc.) while destroying the legacy of the Saga. The movie takes place over a couple of days for whatever reason making the plot self-contained and utterly unimportant. Plot holes galore and a complete disregard for lore. Two and a half hours of torture. Notice how none of my complaints have anything to do with race or gender.

 If you are a Star Wars fan and you love this movie I think you are giving it credit. If you are a Star Wars fan and you hate this movie I can sympathize with you.<br><br>Good: Space battles are awesome. BB8 Kicks some ass. You get a visit with a character from the previous series and it is fun. Good fight with lightsabers. The movie is gorgeous and has interesting alien designs.<br><br>Bad: Where to begin.... If you enjoyed The Force Awakens like I did and were hoping for an interesting follow-up to the story threads from that movie you can just not bother with this movie at all. None of them are answered and it feels like Rian Johnson purposely ignored the most interesting parts of Force Awakens to mock you for even being interested in those things. This is the first Star Wars movie that ended where I could care less if I ever saw another one. Where they leave the film almost all of the characters are exactly where they were in Force Awakens with subtle changes that don't leave me caring what happens to them. Finn is still running from the First Order but trying to save Rey who doesn't really need saving. Sure he is brave but he was brave in Force Awakens too. Rey is still an untrained powerful force user who doesn't know her parents but has some books that may help her. Poe is a hot shot pilot who's story centers around one of the most dubious plot devices in the movie. A plot device that is so shallow it almost makes his character moot to the movie. Leia is still leading the resistance and Luke is still lost to the galaxy. Kylo does get a big promotion but he is so bad at being a leader you kind of don't have any hope he will do a good job with his new found power.<br><br>Where the story ends is not bad and opens the doors to possibilities but they are possibilities you can't even discuss with your friends. These are probably the most interesting discussion you could have with your fellow Star Wars fans:<br>* Will the kid with the broom be important in the next movie? Maybe but we could care less because they spent maybe a minute on him during one a scene in the film so useless it should have probably been cut.<br>* What will Rey do with the books she gets? Start a new Jedi order? They just got rid of the last one. Maybe she could start something new?<br>* Will Finn and Rose marry? Their romance was so forced I could almost say it was unwanted sexual advances on Rose's part.<br>* Will Poe be a great resistance leader? He sure sucked as one in this movie.<br>* Will Klyo be all mean and badass? Probably... he has the biggest change in this movie but he really just has access to more toys now.<br>* Will Luke be in the next movie? I hope that he can redeem himself.<br><br>I have never seen a Star Wars movie where I have nothing to talk about with other fans except whether we liked or hated the movie. That is why this film is so dividing. It provided no answers but it also provided nothing meaty to discuss either. The threads that Force Awakens gave us to discuss were plentiful but by the end of this travesty of a movie all of those discussions were moot. Welcome to the new era of Star Wars where the writers and director went out of his way to make Star Wars not interesting in the slightest., 2.0,  Denis E, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/831608229/, January 25 2018, 
 First off please do NOT give a half-star score as this might not be counted by RT. Whoever reads this please also include this hint at the start of your own review so others will notice too &amp make their voices count!<br><br>This sad excuse for a 'blockbuster' only made money on Box Office because it has the Star Wars label. As a stand-alone movie it would totally fall flat because of sloppy writing inconsistent plot and overall lack of logic and reason in the greater scale of things. This is not just 'fanboys' complaining these are obvious problems that should be clearly visible to anyone who doesn't watch movies solely for the CGI effects.<br><br>And a note to all those 5-star-reviewers: Simply doing something different without reason is not the same as "being original". Presenting out-of-place / unfitting / illogical plot points and/or simply disregarding anything hinted in previous installments is not the same as having "great turn of events". Personality changes and special attitude so minimalistic and/or hidden/vague that only trained psychologists might notice it can not be called "character development". Diversity just for diversity's sake and females in powerful positions just because they are female is not a good way to prove any point or actual value. Purposely contradicting expectations for the sole reason to prove that "nobody was able to guess it" is not a great way to deal with loyal fans/viewers and lets that person rather look like an asshole than a competent writer/director. All this rather feels more like lack of talent sloppy writing forced political agendas and general delusion grandeur and most likely it's exactly that.<br><br>The really sad thing is most of the major plot points/twists disliked or not COULD have worked if they had just been presented in a more sophisticated way with a more fleshed-out plot outline proper explanation how it all got from A to B what motivations each character has etc. etc.<br><br>I remember Disney cartoon series from the 90's that had great characters and entertaining stories full of fun and adventure. Then they switched from 24-minute episodes to 10-minute episodes (to appeal to the statistically-proven shorter attention span of kids) and from fun and adventure to cheap comedy and 'mis-adventures'. Now their "Star Wars: Forces of Destiny" cartoons are only 3 minutes long and with no real story at all just showing a 'short random Star Wars event' each.<br><br>Is this how Disney sees today's viewers? Dimwits that don't care about characters and plots anymore that just want a short YouTube-style clip telling a 'simple in-your-face lesson' or 'just something for a quick laugh'?<br><br>If all Disney wanted to do with Star Wars is purposely destroying a legacy everything that was built in 40+ years and discarding all the original characters without properly honoring them just so they are "free to do whatever they want without being burdened by anything from the past" if they never wanted to expand and go a totally different direction then maybe they should have created their own franchise from the very beginning and not rape Star Wars.<br><br>And one last thing: just because I created an account here with a temporary e-mail to comment is NOT proof that I'm a bot nor that any of the other negative comments are 'manipulated' or posted by 'just a few disgruntled hardcore fans'. EVERYONE who commented here negatively has stated detailed reasons paragraph after paragraph while most positive reviews only have one or two lines and more importantly usually not a SINGLE example/explanation for their praise just general statements like "great turn of events blah blah"... so please judge by reasoning/size/variation of content not by which means they were posted!, ,  Marcus F, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977073394/, January 25 2018, 
 What can I say about the Last Jedi? How about bad? Seems like a simple word but the movie is bad. It's not a bad Star Wars movie it's just a bad movie period! Before I mention what was bad and there was a lot of bad let me mention the good. Good effects. Good editing and sound. It better be though since it is a Star Wars movie. What was bad?(SPOILERS!!!!!)Most of the film. Bad characters(many wasted and unnecessary). Bad character development(very little if at all) Bad plot(most of the characters did things that made no sense for their character. Also side quest/sub plot accomplished nothing and was a waste of time.). Bad writing(timeline confusing story basically Empire Strikes back with a little Return of the Jedi just in a different order). Bad directing(we have to show Luke fishing milking sea cows and walking around the island? That's important?). Bad exposition(too much talking and explaining. Movies are visual). Bad jokes(jokes were forced and not funny. Most of them made me cringe)<br><br>I saw the movie twice. I disliked it the first time but thought I was too critical of it so I saw it a second time since I was doing an internet review. The second time made me really hate it. Overall a very very bad movie. Of all the Star Wars movies and shows out there I would rate it slightly above the Star Wars Christmas Special. That at least had Boba Fett in it! Last Jedi has good effects and space scenes but nothing else worth mentioning., 0.5,  William W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977073341/, January 25 2018,

 Hasn't Disney been paying attention to what has happened in the comic book industry for the last few years? Pushing the SJW/Feminist agenda in Marvel comics has failed spectacularly. Pushing this in Star Wars will also fail. The reason? The typical SJW/Feminist are not interested in the superhero genre. They are not willing to spend their time or money on these products. Their only concern is in hijacking platforms to spread their message at the expense of everything else. Weak-minded docile male feminists are willing to go along with this in the hopes of increasing their sexual market value.<br>The destruction and humiliation of Luke Skywalker is a goal of the SJW/feminist agenda. The male power fantasy. Anything male and competent is bad. Men need to be humiliated and put in their place by "strong independent purple haired women" (but if these women need a tire changed or a jar opened then they know who to call) Women are sugar and spice and everything nice.<br>Rey's character is ridiculous (Ridley does a great job with what she was given though). If Rey is to be a role model for young girls and women I think the message is terrible. "No work or effort is required for you to be competent. You can be awesome simply because you're female!". Real life doesn't work that way. It takes hard work and effort to master skills no matter who you are. Rey masters the force because... girl power?<br>The subplots are meaningless in this movie. They go nowhere and add nothing to the story. Token diverse characters rammed in because diversity is good for it's own sake. A waste of time., 1.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977007930/, January 25 2018, 
 While this movie had several key elements that elevated it to the minimum quality expected from a Star Wars movie it was hamstrung by irrelevant and bloated plot lines and an utter lack of character development. Is this supposed to be Guardians of the Galaxy? Because it looks like the director just saw that movie and decided 'hey easy cash grab.' The logical inconsistencies and lack of exposition compound on each other to make an utterly incomprehensible plot that was half fan service and half Disney attempting to milk the franchise for cheap laughs and toy sales. Everything that The Force Awakens did right this movie did wrong. And while it attempted to expand the new story line past the fan service of episode 7 the only notable expansions were gimicky and led to unresolved plot lines. What has this series become?

 Hands down worst SW in my opinion. I loved a lot of stuff that The Force Awakens set up for this new trilogy. Then JJ Abrams passed the ball to Rian Johnson so he could score the goal but instead Rian took the ball and threw it out of the court. Bad Continuity way too much cheap comic relief that was poorly timed and an unbelievable amount of wasted potential. But I think one of my biggest problems with this film is that The First Order was portayed as a bunch of bumbling idiots instead of a cunning brutal relentless military group to be reckoned with like the Empire was and I was hoping that The Knights of Ren would be more invovled in this movie but intead they weren't even mentioned. TLJ felt like a Marval/Disney movie not Star Wars. Maybe Episode 9 will redeem some of the flaws but overall TLJ has tainted the franchise.<br>In JJ we trust., 0.5,  Jon D, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977073231/, January 25 2018,

 People always say the prequels had bad dialogue but it takes place in a different universe so the language or stuff they talk about my be different but this film has maybe the worst story ive ever seen and ray is only strong because she just is for no reason what so ever i mean think about it both of the skywalkers dont do anything like fight a highly trained sith or dark side users in the first film and the first time we see them do so they lose because they didn't have the training or experience to do so but ray can some how beat kylo just because she believes she can thats called poor story telling and since when do star wars movies lead straight into the next one they don't its always a couple of years between each other the last two trilogy's tell you that they have been trying in the spaces between the movies as to not take up most of the movie but all luke does is give her some advice how is that enough to train her the only way she could be any were near that good is if she is using the dark side of the force, ,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976965694/, January 25 2018,

 STAR WARS THE LAST JEDI<br>This film could have been EPIC! But no instead they fucked it up truly after the Force Awakens we was under false impressions that once Rey had found Luke we would be treated to an epic story and revival of the old school Jedi master what we got was just plain stupid and too many plot holes to mention but here are some of the things that really pissed me off! <br> When Rey hands Luke his lightsabre he just throws it over his shoulders<br> When they bomb the dreadnought class ship somehow the bombs drop like a W2 bombing raid there is no gravity in space WTF!<br> On the island Luke has become a hermit and feeding of some lazy looking lizards WTF!<br> Luke is nothing like the Luke from the past he is a totally different person<br> Rey is nobody with parents who sold her off there is no connection as to how she has suddenly become very powerful and without any training she can do as much as Luke WTF!<br> Snoke was supposed to be very powerful and yet he gets killed by Kylo ren using a Jedi trick erm?<br> Now this bit really made me think "WTF" is going on in this movie when Leah is blown out into space then like superman or a god she can use the force to survive and fly back into the ship WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF<br> Why did the rebels stop short of their destination and then allow the first order to pursue picking them off one at a time? Why did they not jump to light speed again to reach the planet sooner? They never mentioned running out of fuel in past movies.<br> The snobby bitch general would not disclose her intentions or plans but happily let the rest of the remaining fleet get destroyed! Maybe she thought she was higher class than the paupers.<br> Said snobby bitch then decides once all the ships have been picked of apart from the one with Leah on-board she will turn her own ship around and use it as a light speed weapon which sliced right through Snokes ship cutting it to shreds! Now I did think it looked spectacular but also thought why have they never done this before? They could easily sacrifice a few X-wing fighters in past movies to do the same job only a few lives would be lost but they would take out the entire first order or the galactic empire fleet from older films the baddies would be running for their lives game over!<br> Towards the end of the film we see Luke appear in front of the rebels last hideout then Kylo ren orders all fire power onto that man which they do then once the dust settles Luke is still standing there then simply just looks at his shoulder and brushes of a bit of dirt Holy shit wow I thought this is when Luke makes a dramatic comeback and finishes of that stupid brat "Kylo ren" but oh no that is not what we got instead Luke is just a hologram and in doing so strains himself so much that it kills him why? So now they have ruined is character and killed him off WTF!<br>There are too many things to list but most people would probably think the same so this film has ruined what star wars should be and I can't see how they can repair the damage done now it would seem there idea is that anyone can have Jedi power without any training or knowledge! And the laws of physics no longer exist.<br>So here is what I think will happen in the next movie "Q" from the STAR TREK universe will intervene and put everything back the way it was supposed to be! See any Star Trek hatters out there you know it to be true!, 1.0,  Phil T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977068633/, January 24 2018, 
 This movie was such a depressing and destructive mess. I have spent a great deal of time trying to understand how Disney could have allowed this to happen to a property for which they expended so much capital and resources. It is simply mind boggling.<br><br>Lately however I have turned my mind towards how on earth any sort of coherent story arc can be salvaged out of the plot and character elements that remain. I can't fix everything that has gone wrong but here's what I have come up with.<br><br>Ben Solo is severely mentally ill. He is suffering from a fragmented personality disorder. Think James McAvoy in Split. Unfortunately he is also the most powerful Force user ever known in the Star Wars universe.<br><br>Ben's psych was permanently damaged when he dabbled in the Force early in his training. He couldn't handle the ugliness he experienced and his emotional distance from all of the adults in his life prevented him from working through his cognitive dissonance. He therefore dissociated forming four distinct personalities. Luke realized that Ben was severely ill and could not be healed. There was simply no hope for a cure and Luke tried to end his life as a mercy killing to end Ben's terrible suffering.<br><br>Ben's personalities manifest in various ways all powered by his unusually strong Force abilities:<br><br>The first was Snoke. Snoke was a force projection from Ben's tortured mind. Snoke manifested as a harsh and critical father figure. He is cruel and violent and can never be pleased. He is seemingly all powerful.<br><br>Kylo Ren is the dominant personality but he is not stable. He is not aware of the other personalities and he is highly emotional. His struggle to maintain control makes him extremely unstable and subject to uncontrollable rages.<br><br>Ben is repressed but he still exists. Ben is the one who spoke to Rey so rationally and calmly during the force connection sequences. Ben is the one who asked Rey to join him but he would not have been strong enough to control Kylo even if she had said yes.<br><br>The final personality has no name and does not manifest itself as a part of Ben. This is the part of him that is tortured by guilt remorse and self-hatred and that wants to be stopped and killed. This part of him has reached out to Rey. It has projected onto her all of Ben's Force skills and powers as well as his mechanical and piloting skills. This is also the part of him that saved his Mother when she was blown out of her ship. This final personality knows that Luke was right to try to kill him. It wants Rey to defeat Kylo and to end of all of their torment by killing Ben. <br><br>The trilogy will end when Ben unifies these personalities long enough to repent to engage in some act of self-sacrifice that redeems him before using his powers to compel Rey to kill him. I would imagine a scene that is the mirror image of Kylo's murder of Han Solo except this time Rey is pleading with him not to make her do it and to choose life with her instead. But we all know that Ben cannot come back fully from all the evil he has done and he is not strong enough to hold the personalities together for long. Ben knows what he has to do. He forces her to kill him with his own lightsaber.<br><br>I realize that this strips Rey of all of her supposed powers and makes her a pawn but at least she will no longer be a Mary Sue. Her character can continue in other movies perhaps this time choosing to study the Force herself and become adept. <br><br>Anyway that's all I can think of to salvage this complete mess.<br><br>Maybe they can bring Luke back in some form in the last film to explain some of this. Luke's character needs to be fixed somehow if this trilogy is to be salvaged.<br><br>Oh and PLEASE leave the contemporary USA politics out of the next movie., 1.0,  Diane S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977072186/, January 24 2018,

 I have seen it four times. First time I walked out disappointed and confused and then later I was pretty upset. I thought it was garbage and poorly done. I was confused on why people were saying that this is a great film and it might be one of the best. Intelligent and bold? I was sincerely confused. I watched a few reviews on youtube and people had the same feelings I did. Reys parents are no one? They just killed off Snoke? Luke was not Luke Skywalker? I was upset! Of course negativity spreads faster than positivity and Star Wars fans hate Star Wars more than anyone else. <br><br>I've been so invested in Star Wars that I had to give it a second chance. I went a second time and walked out really liking it. I had more fun this time around and I was slowly understanding why people like it so much. I also understand why people hate it so much. The third time I saw it I liked it more and started understanding why it is bold and intelligent. I like it but don't love it. The whole Canto Bite Casino scene was just out of place and screwed up the tone and pacing. I understand why its there but just didn't feel right. Also the actress who played Rose was to cutesy for the role. I just couldn't get into her. Everything with Luke Kylo and Rey was awesome! <br><br>A lot of fans are angry because they had all these expectations and they weren't met. No matter what you tell them the film is trash. Luke transcends the force and the Jedi. He used the force for knowledge and defense not attack. He showed what a true Jedi really is and gave hope to a doomed galaxy. He became the legend! Its awesome Reys parents are no one. Why does she have to be apart of a blood line. It makes her more compelling and her journey more difficult. Snoke doesn't matter and never did. He was an arch for Kylos growth and his final steps to darkness. Fans made him a big deal. If fans want to keep seeing the same thing then they need to watch the OT otherwise the story will get stagnate if there are no changes. Not great but good fun film. Im happy with the installment!, 5.0,  Sean T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976998872/, January 24 2018, 
 Editing my original review I was way too kind the first time<br><br>This film is morally and creatively bankrupt. It's a charmless deconstruction of the Star Wars universe whose main purpose seems to be as a platform for Johnson and Kennedy's social justice and feminist virtue signalling.<br><br>The shameful illogical and ridiculous transformation of Luke Skywalker from iconic hero to reclusive suicidal jerk is unforgivable and demonstrates both contempt for and a lack of understanding of the timeless themes of his story in the OT. Make no mistake this was not a 'bold creative choice' it was a malicious ideologically driven character assassination. <br>Kennedy and Johnson despise Luke.<br><br>What's ironic is in their rush to 'let the past die' kill off timeless themes and lecture us to death with their SJW crap they forgot how to create interesting characters or tell a compelling--or even coherent--story. <br><br>A complete trainwreck that's probably done lasting damage to the saga., 1.0,  Harold S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976963979/, January 24 2018,

 I wanted to finally see the rest of Luke Skywalker's story. I expected what happened to Luke post-RotJ to matter to have some meaning and significance beyond Luke being just another figure in the wider story. This movie for me at least robbed him of the centrality of his story and didn't even bother telling most of what happened to him at all. To say it was painful is an understatement. Awful., 0.5,  Jeremy S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/907552138/, January 24 2018,

 A long time ago in a galaxy very close indeed I was left inspired thrilled and distraught by a movie that felt like more than just a story to me - that was Empire. The problems of three little people amounted to more than a hill of beans in this crazy world. The fate of the galaxy could be shaped by the actions good or bad of a few individuals. Not many films have higher stakes or loftier themes. Or the potential to be more ridiculous and self important. I guess a lot of people did find it silly but not me I was inspired. I haven't felt that way in a long long time. <br><br>Until now. <br><br>The Force Awakens was great for reminding me of the characters the lore and flesh of the original trilogy. A trip to my hometown. With The Last Jedi it is the emotions the guts the intrigue and joy that is resurfacing. But this is a new journey and I don't know where it's going. I'm excited. I'm invigorated. I'm heartened. <br><br>There's a lot to chew over here and it definitely benefits from a second viewing. But the nourishment from the tasty mouthfuls of great dialogue acting lore extensions character development and philosophy seasoned with some genuine surprises are well worth the occasional gristly lumps. Absolutely delicious., 5.0,  Bobbles M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977071815/, January 24 2018, 
 I love how the 5 star reviews start out with: "Yes I know there are problems but......." or "Best Star Wars ever". Neither of which go into detail about why they liked the movie. Its as if these reviewers are clearly looking over the negative reviews of others then giving their feedback. Its pathetic to a striking level at how far Disney will go to make this movie not look like the shit show that it is. 2 weeks into release in China and its pulled!!?? That is beyond pathetic. The giant turd Transformers: Revenge of the Dark Moon First Knight who gives a fuck what they call it movie did better in China. That's sad to a depressing degree for Disney. If they do not pull Rian J from doing the planned trilogy they are digging their own graves and burying themselves with the Star Wars franchise.<br><br>If there was ever a movie to turn you away from a beloved franchise its this pile of hot monkey shit called the Last Jedi. I would prefer to see that feminazi new Ghostbusters movie with the only scenes being that of the loud mouthed black lady. I would prefer to watch a reboot of Pluto Nash rather than the Last Jedi again. I would prefer to watch the Anakin scene where he talks about sand in a seductive way over and over again for 3 hours instead of seeing the Last Jedi again. At least this scene made more sense than anything in LJ.<br><br>Let's get to the main points:<br><br>1) Star Wars movies have always been about the Skywalker family line. Anakin Luke and Leia. They have been the main characters and each of them have their own story line that fulfills the heroes journey. The main hero in the LJ is Rey excuse me Mary Sue. She starts off the franchise never getting hurt never in real danger has insane force powers needs no training handles a light saber better than Qui Gon (a Jedi master) no flaws flys the Millenium Falcon better in her first try than Han Solo after 25 years etc. I could go on and on. The point is that she is perfect and bypassed training and hard times and is basically the most powerful person in the universe for an unknown reason. The reason should have been laid out by Rian Johnson or at least left the door open to it. He clearly stated in an interview that Rey's parents are indeed some drunk losers that abandoned her. Basically this implies that Rey has no ties to the Skywalker line and this is the new direction of Star Wars. Rian J just fucked JJ with this. In Force Awakens JJ set up Rian so he could easily take helm and pilot the ship on course. Rian took the wheel and broke it in half then burned the ship into the ocean with this stupid idea of Rey's lineage. <br>2) Luke was a disaster from start to finish. Rian destroyed Luke not by killing him off but by torturing millions of Luke fans with how the character was portrayed. Throwing the light saber over his shoulder!!!?? Really!!?? He left a map with R2D2 to help the rebels or Leia find him. When they finally do he says "leave me alone". Seriously Rian??? You pathetic worm. Luke's character from 40+ years is now ruined because you decided to be the guy that takes a beloved character and turn him into a crack-pot old miser. I dont mind that Luke was killed off but the way it happened made absolutely no sense. There was no heroism no set up no mentioning of force projection powers NADA!!!! Luke died from being stressed out. I'll get more into this later. RJ is turd pile for what he did to Luke's character. No light saber duel. No show of force strength(force projection was nonsense). No heroism. No likeability.<br>3) Continuity. There is none. Others have gone into this in detail so I won't. We all know that RJ did not even see the original movies or the prequel trilogy. I dont think he even saw Force Awakens. He was handed a golden goose and told about the instructions for how to care for it. He said "dont worry about it I got it. I know what I'm doing" then proceeded to torture the goose before he covered it in gasoline set it on fire and then shot it with a bazooka.<br>4) Characters. First off Rose is worse than Jar Jar. Everytime I think of this cluster fuck of a character I see that scene where her an Finn are being held by Storm troopers. She then tries to angrily escape while growling. EEEESSSSHHHH. That disturbing image is stuck in my head. Let's get one thing clear. Asian women are not tough. They never have been and may never will be. Making Rose look tough is like making a Darth Vader mask look happy. It should not be done because it is disingenuous. Her character is pointless and should not have been in the movie. We all know the reason why too. Disney wanted to play the China race card. I'm so glad the moved failed in China. Hopefully this moronic choice of character and bad acting will disappear. Actually I don't care I"m not going to see anymore Star Wars movies anyways. So please......keep this cluster fuck character in. Episode 9 can fail even more spectacularly.<br>Now for Admiral purple hair. Another pointless character. A nod to the Millennial generation feminazi movement and a hint that her and Leia are lesbian lovers. No background no story bad acting pointless storyline no logical thinking. <br>Poe is garbage and his character is not a hero or even likeable. Slapped around like a little bitch. Again no backstory no explanation for how he can pilot any ship as though he was God. No reason to even root for him to succeed. Another pile of steaming dog shit character that Rian fucked up.<br>Emo Ren went from bad to worse. Not talking about his path in the movie but his character development. A giant crying baby that needs a hug. He is the new supreme leader now!!?? This pathetic excuse for a Sith!? Bad guys are supposed to be feared. This dipshit is better off shoving a porg up his ass and becoming a cross dresser. That would make more sense in the character arc than making him supreme leader.<br><br>4) Politics. Disney is strong with the political correctness. Feminism Class warfare Veganism Capitalism. They clearly show where they stand on all these issues. The rich are evil women are better than men meat is bad Capitalism is bad(although Disney is the proprietor of greed). Disney and Johnson are shooting to capture the Millennial audience by pushing these left wing ideals. Its almost sickening how hard they pushed their message. I was expecting to see one of the remaining rebels that escaped at the end take off their mask and be revealed to be Bernie Sanders.<br><br>Closing thought. The movie was a slap in the face to all Star Wars fans. Clearly the review system even on RT does not tell the true story. This was the worst Star Wars film of all time. I am truly sad that it had to end this way. My hope is that Disney takes a monster hit on Episode 9 and decides to change their ways and stick with what worked for 40+ years. Perhaps JJ can save what the scumbag Johnson did. I'm afraid it might be too late. The damage has been done. Johnson made sure of that. FU Rian Johnson. FU Disney. FU Kathleen Kennedy. Thanks for ruining my childhood so you morons could stick your chest out and pound it like a gorilla. FU., 1.0,  Chris M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/904151014/, January 24 2018, 
 To put it simple The Last Jedi is more like a joke. It seems to be delighted to break every canon both from the previous 2 trilogies and mainly 'The Force Awakens' which is kind of akward. The screenplay is just awful and hopefully J.J. Abrams will fix most of the damage at Episode IX (but he will have to work hard to accomplish it)., 0.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976997565/, January 24 2018, 
 The biggest let down in star wars history. Worse than the prequels. It made Luke into a chump and unlikable. Wasted Carrie fisher in her last movie.

 Social justice agenda has become the only concern of Disney/Kennedy/Johnson. I fear that in the next installment of the saga we will see a handicapped jedi on a wheelchair obviously woman obviously black/oriental/redskin/aborigen maybe bisexual/transgender/gay/lesbian/metrosexual hopefully with asperger's or ADHD. If the statistics will discover another group with "differences" I think they will include it too. Maybe they should start considering those with eating disorders premenstrual syndrome or allergies. After having found a way to include all of the available or conceivable "different human types" maybe they will devote a couple of committee meetings for developing a script which will obviously be full of inconsistencies and plot holes but as mentioned before their only concern is to be all-inclusive. Everything is OK for me. I have only one request: please don't call it Star Wars., 1.0,  Peter H, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977072841/, January 25 2018,

 I think some of this score is the result of butthurt among those who are mad that fascism isn't celebrated (as if it ever was in SW) and female characters actually play important roles (like that's new in SW either). There is probably some issue with those who didn't get their pet theories validated too which is a product of a bunch of expectations that no film could satisfy. <br><br>The whole "Mary Sue" complaint carried over from TFA is a bit ridiculous because I don't ever remember this being an issue with Anakin Skywalker. Why him huh? When did he get to be this ace pilot or how did he built robots as a slave child? Rey is older and had to become basically a bad ass to survive alone. She didn't get limited by an owner so she could learn what she needed and wanted to understand if it helped her. The Force may have helped her too without her realizing it.<br><br>Anyway I found the run time not overly long. The pacing made me forget all about it even during the Finn/Rose sequence. That's when I started wondering if some critics were being hypercritical. Finn and Poe learned valuable lessons that will help their future contributions. That was significant and easily conveyed if Holdo's determination not to tell Poe her plan a legitimate concern.<br><br>Rey learned things. too and we may not appreciate them fully given they relate to things hidden until IX is out. Given things Lucas has about the nature of archetypes and his space opera I doubt Reylo is done. <br><br>My main initial complaint concerned what Mark Hamill said about Luke Skywalkers' story arc. He isn't the same Jedi. He learned why the Jedi cannot balance the Force by themselves and his new wisdom AND his deep regret over Kylo/Ben fueled what he did. If one can accept that backstory Hamill gives a fantastic performance and it should be savored. (Indeed the film is well acted top to bottom.) From those lessons however painful he goes out in an epic way like a hero -- and on his own terms. That worked incredibly well.<br><br>I refused to see VII because I knew they'd kill off Han Solo at Harrison Ford's insistence and I didn't want to watch. So I had little invested in what occurred in VIII and enjoyed it on its own terms despite whatever flaws are there or my concern going in.

 Jedi: The Last Star Wars, 1.0,  Banta P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977072801/, January 25 2018, 
 Underwhelming. It felt like a repeat of the same story: a hotheaded apprentice with conflicting loyalty and family issues tries to take over/save the galaxy while other hotheads blow stuff up. Each scene felt like a fresh hastily-devised threat which is promptly overcome or avoided before the next meaningless peril arrives for another predictable resolution. Some scenes - like that of Laura Dern's Holdo watching the escape pods being destroyed one-by-one - seemed to be put on pause whilst we returned to other scenes making her character seem tactically dim-witted. Indeed the rate at which the pods were being blown up with the number of pods available made it confusing how any survived given the length of time of the intervening scenes. There's comedy - some good (Chewie's lunch being interrupted) some cheap and cringey (Kylo Ren shirtless Captain "Salty"). The acting feels hammed up but that might not stand out so much if you saw the saga films back-to-back. There are good moments and it is generally entertaining but I left the IMAX feeling like I should have waited for it to come out on Netflix., 2.5,  Tom O, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977026759/, January 25 2018, 
 I have been a Star Wars fan ever since I was blown away by Episode IV as a 10-year-old. While I didn't like how Episode VII looked like an updated version of Episode IV (and frankly I didn't find the new lead character Rey that interesting) I could still enjoy it. For Episode VIII I can't even say that this movie isn't Star Wars it's merely a sci-fi movie which they called Star Wars - the Star Wars feel simply isn't there. <br>I can't believe the director actually claims to be a Star Wars fan after how he mutilated this movie. Neither the story nor the lead characters are interesting except for Kylo Ren and Luke. And Speaking of Luke what kind of end is that for one of our most beloved Star Wars characters!? <br>For the first time ever I'm not excited about Star Wars.

 Overall great fun and enjoyable to watch albeit quite sad. The changing of the old guard to the new is never going to be fully enjoyable watching heroes grow old and die is never fun and is a problem most reboots face. I really disliked the way parts of the plot were irrelevant to the broader storyline there was some element of pointlessness to it. But the way the force was explored and the emotional direction of the movie were really well done. The balance between good and evil and light and dark were covered well. Looking forward to seeing how the next movie wraps up some of the storylines., 4.0,  Ceallach E, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977072735/, January 25 2018, 
 I don't go to the theater to have someones idea of a PC world shoved down my throat and that is what I got. Weak story line left me wondering again and again "Why did they do this or that". Half way through movie I kept wondering when would this torture end. All the time thinking that this is not Lucas's vision leaving me sick to my stomach enduring till the credits rolled. I walked out thinking that the next episode will not be worth the purchase of a ticket. Who made this mess?<br>One last bit of comments before leaving Star Wars in the past unless in the unlikely event that Disney replaces those who purposely wizzed on the fans faces. Make no mistake about the intent of the directors. It is not like Kathleen and co. all of the sudden forgot how to make a good movie. Rest assure that this gal gets a raging hard-on from every negative review confirming to her that the mission was a complete success. Which mission is to get on screen all of the SJW PC BS possible sticking it to the fans which is really just sticking it to George's baby (don't think for one moment that Mr. Lucas does not know this) and laughing all the way to the bank., 1.0,  Steve P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977029640/, January 24 2018,

 I've seen it 3 times now and it only has gotten better with each viewing! I am astounded at the negativity and extreme lack of understanding of the rich layers of this film by rabid fans who are quick to yell "plot holes" or "lazy writing" if it's not spelled out for them. In reality It's lazy minded regurgitated expectations that have let the "outspoken minority" down. Out of 175 thousand fans writing a review on RT half did not like this movie which nowhere near represents the overall fanbase or the casual movie goer who LOVED this film and yet don't have the time to post reviews online. Not to mention the amazing Box Office numbers prove that especially when Disney and studios knew flat out that The Last Jedi was NEVER expected to make TFA numbers. Number 6 film all time domestically one of only 4 films that crossed the 600 million mark domestically and people are yelling failure? They want to justify their hate for this movie so bad that they've convinced themselves it's a box office failure?? LOL...wow....

 I agree with many of the negative reviews and won't repeat the many reasons that others have elaborated upon instead I want to address the elephant in the room here... I've seen page after page of 1/2 star and 1 stat audience reviews yet the audience score sits at 49%. How is this possible? I've heard that half stars don't count and if that is true it is very dishonest and manipulative on the part of RT. Many in the media have suggested that the negative audience reviews were "review bombed" by disgruntled fans but I see the opposite. I see many well written well thought out critiques of this movie and it's story telling choices and an audience score that in no way reflects that until you dig in and read the reviews. So I guess this experience has left me with two big takeaways. <br>1. I no longer trust Disney's handling of Star Wars. They are more interested in quick profit and political/social lecturing as opposed to telling good stories and offering imagination and escapism. <br>2. I no longer trust Rotten Tomatoes for being an impartial barometer of the audience response to a movie., 1.0,  m b, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977071478/, January 24 2018, 
 This film is terrible. As a film. As Star Wars it's surprisingly bad as well. I don't know if I'm more shocked that it's just a bad film over all or a bad Star Wars film. The "Critic" consensus of this film is absolutely mind boggling. After seeing it myself and then check out critic review since the film left me so jarred I could not believe what I was seeing. "TLJ honors the saga's legacy"? What? It does? TFA killed Han and Leia's relationship and even killed Han in a very anticlimactic way. The First Order exist like the Empire was never destroyed. Despite the good guys winning in Return of the Jedi we have a "Resistance" faction like they're not in control! How is that honoring legacy? In TLJ it get's EVEN WORSE! WAAAAY WORSE! Leia's role is cast aside with her being something of a side piece to an Admiral Holdo some one we've never seen. Leia also demonstrates a complete lack of leadership in this film something that in the previous films? She was a master class at. Admiral Ackbar has like a 1 second cameo and then is killed virtually off screen. Wow what a way to honor that side legacy. And it's not just Old Triligy Legacy that's trampled here it's even The Force Awakens. I never liked the Force Awakens. I found the film to be impressively shallow and Rey to be extremely irritating and frustrating to watch. However in this film? They some how rip apart most of TFA which is mildly impressive. I don't remember the last series I watched that was inconsistent with itself in such a short amount of time. Plot threads started in TFA were completely dropped or literally and figuratively utterly killed. Snoke? Killed. Phasma? Brought back was on the screen for a minute longer killed. Rey's training? Maybe 12 hours... never completes her training actually. At least the one thing they keep consistent is Rey's power level being extremely high with no real explanation what so ever. <br><br>The worst travesty is likely what they did to Luke and I see that I'm not the only one. After weeks of looking at everyone's reaction most are pissed with Luke. Luke is so mishandled in this film that it's definately "divisive" as in "some people will ignore the errors because they're numb and some people will hate the errors because they're so fundamentally destructive that there's no salvation for the trilogy anymore" divisive. TFA undid everything in the OT rather effectively on it's own but at the very least it could have redeemed itself with this sequel by filling in the plot threads it sprung. Instead TLJ literally takes place immidiately AFTER TFA with the destruction of Star Killer Base being only a few hours old and during the running time of the film we're told that the fleet running from the First Order only has about 18 hours of fuel left. So by the time Rey leaves to find Luke on a very distant world to the time she suddenly arrives again on Crait (after her stint on Snoke's ship that ended up with the Supreme Leader being Wasted) she doesn't even spend a full day with Luke. The time span of the film is a terrible choice the editing is jumbled and the script has so many gaping plot holes that there's simply not enough suspension of disbelief to look past them. And Luke? We spend nearly a full 2 hours of this film (minus the absolutely atrocious side plot with Rose and Finn) deconstructing Luke and character assassinating him. THIS. THIS is what people are REALLY pissed about. Luke is so deformed from his true self from the OT that he's not recognizable. The worst part is it didn't even seem like Jar Jar Abram's had the same idea for Luke. The 30 second reveal at TFAs ending seemed like Luke was going to be totally more appreciative of his character. However in this film? Mark Hamill is literally acting out a different character than Luke. The facial expression on that shot is even different. Compare it yourself. Re-watch TFA's ending. Rian literally ran counter to J.J. Binks own film. Luke's expression at the first time we see him in this film is the perfect analogy for how I feel about Star Wars going forward. He takes the light saber looks at it... then tosses it over his shoulder and walks away never saying a word. In other words "I don't give a f***". <br><br>The film as a film itself makes terrible blunders that if not for the Disney level pedigree of the creators and the Star Wars title would see the film utterly ripped apart by critics. The flaws are truly gruesome here. The ROOM is a better movie because this film actually TRIES TO BE FUNNY but FAILS at it so it turns out to be incredibly cringe worthy and frustrating as a result. The Room is one of the worst of all time but the charm about that film is it's creator the sincerity of it and how it actually thinks itself serious. There for it's a cult classic. This film? This is a garbage cash grab. It really feels like it was directed by the marketing department. There's little vision. This is the worst Star Wars film for Set Pieces. Majority of the film is ships flying in space slowly during the longest chase I've ever seen. When you compare this film to Mad Max Mad Max is the apex this film is the literally bottom. Another scene is a boring Casino planet seen which looks antithetical to Star Wars's usual designs. It's very Earth LIke and uninspired. Most SW films try to take you to 3 locales of unique visuals to space it up. This one squanders that. Now Crait? I did find visually splendid. Bueatiful set piece. The contrast of Red and White is breath taking. You didn't even need the whole red crystals just the surface contrast was enough. However the set is very simple and it's also kind'a short. The battle on Crait is no where NEAR the grandiose of Hoth. Hoth also had a massive build up since we saw the crew on Hoth well before the battle itself. We saw terrible weather and Luke get lost horrifying creatures and the general scope of the land scape from above and below. In TLJ Crait is no where near as setup. While it's gorgeous it's barely utilized for the story's sake. Instead it's literally a mcguffin since the planet is "conveniently" next door when the fleet runs out of fuel and it "conveniently" has an old Rebel Base that "conveniently" has a form of shielding plot device (a giant door basically) that forces the First Order into a ground battle. How.... convenient. <br><br>The side plot with Finn and Rose is just... very bad. It feels even worse than above. They are sent by Poe who doubt Admiral Holdo to find a code breaker. Poe is shown speaking to Maz which itself is wierd since... in TFA? We don't get much exposition to prove if Poe or anyone else besides Han and crew should know Maz but... what ever. They need a code break to turn off the Hyper Space tracking. Ok. So Poe sends Finn and Rose. They go to Canto Blite this... boring Casino planet. It's basically Las Vegas for the galaxy elite. They get arrested for not paying a parking ticket (LOL WUT?) and cannot find the code breaker. HOWEVER they do "conveniently" find a replacement who easily breaks out of his cell because he was... I don't know waiting for gullible character's in the story? The whole sequence is way too long and causes within itself plot holes to the main arch. If Finn and Rose can leave to go to an entirely different world... why can't no one else? They can cloak too? I mean what happened to "No Ship that small has a cloaking device"? Whatever. To me the Canto Blite side quest was terrifyingly bad because it crams political statements into it which means that in less than 10 years this film will be badly dated and not persist at all as a timeless classic PERIOD. Rose and Finn eventually end up "rescuing" the... Dog Horse... aliens... things that are being used in Derby's for betting. They basically commit mild "mischeviousness" by releasing the Rich People's pets and then Rose says "This makes it worth it"... but at the end of it all? They see tons of slave children. CHILD SLAVES. However literally doing nothing for them. The damned animals are let loose but never the kids? Wow.<br>Nice morality Rose. It's almost as bad as Finn defecting from the First Order because a fellow trooper died only to have him suddenly blast all of his friends when he's leaving with Poe. This whole trilogy is devoid of a moral compass. <br><br>The dialogue is very campy. A joke is forced into every situation which ruins tension. And some shots are simply jarring with very poor setup or even a contradictory style to the trilogy over all. Leia Poppins is a good example of this and Poe's "mom jokes" to Hux is another. Kills all tension or looks very awkward. <br><br>Holdo is a new character that is barely introduced at all. Not only that but her script actually makes most of the audience think we should totally hate her. Her decisions are counter to common sense and when Poe is shown questioning her and even eventually stirring a mutiny against her? We're actually rooting for it! Without the knowledge of the Hyper Tracker at first we actually think Holdo is a spy! She seems to almost sabatoge everything on purpose letting "rebel members" die for painfully long amounts of time before making a decision. This chick is a one-to-one brain dead Stand In for a Donald Trump. She's THAT stupid. But instead at the end? POE IS WRONG! WHAT?! Holdo and Leia are best buds and some how Poe is wrong? Holdo doesn't even tell Poe her plan a plan that Poe (once he hears it post mutiny) he actually agrees with! So why didn't she just tell Poe? WHY?! This whole god damned FILM is like this. WHY? NOTHING BUT WHY! Why is Finn shown to be so stupid! Why did Rose prevent Finn from growing as a character in the end!? Why is their side quest even in this film? IT LITERALLY ACCOMPLISHES NOTHING AND HAD TERRIBLE MORALITY. Why is Luke so NOT Luke? Why is Rey still so strong? Why is Kylo still a child? Why is Snoke dead? Why is Hux in command if HE IS SOOOO STUPID? WHY is Leia FLYING? WHY IS FUEL SUDDENLY A PROBLEM?! WHY!?!??!?!?!?<br><br>Fuck this film. FUCK. THIS.

 It was the worst film in the whole Star Wars franchise. Nothing works the film end and there is no big villain anymore tensed moments are ruined by humor the plot revolves around a mission that fails and which isn't interesting in any way. The telepathy annoyed me there was never said in any of the films that Jedi had some kind of Bible or any sacred book Poe Dameron is nothing but a dangerous traitor who should get executed (but gets promoted instead at the end). Nothing works., 0.5,  Thought it was a good film and enjoyed it. Some nice surprises and good emotive scenes such as the bombing run near the beginning giving a sense that this is war and the sacrifices made. some bits i didn't like but that maybe the fan part of me being unhappy but over all it is a good film., 4.0,  David W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/791455403/, January 24 2018, 
 If you turn your brain OFF ignore the entirety of the Star Wars saga that came before love computer graphics and needed further affirmation that your feministic social justice warrior beliefs are in main culture this is absolutely a must see. <br><br>Everyone else don't give another penny to Disney for this bloody mess. As you keep reading down you will find each and every negative review usually goes to great analytical length with exactly how much the film fails not just to be Star Wars but to have any redeeming qualities in story telling. The positive reviews usually leave a sentence or two and no further analysis is given on WHY they love or like anything. Usually the profiles aren't real as when you click them you get a "user not found" page. So basically this "49%" liked it audience score could be MUCH much lower. <br><br>I cannot stress enough not to see this film if you haven't already and I'm happy at least to see that most of the real reviews are saying that they will not see the next Star Wars installment either. Go a step even further see NOTHING created by Disney and force them to realize they need to be creative if they want any money or to still have an audience in the future. Boycott every Disney film including Marvel this any other studios affiliated with Disney. Don't take your damn kids to Disney land.

 To sum this movie up in one word would be disappointing. Sure points were entertaining but the end ruined the entire movie. They way they handled Luke was abysmal. I followed the carrot on the stick from the Force Awakens for a promise of Luke doing some amazing things and was fooled with this movie. Also the way Snoke went out like a punk with no backstory was terrible. After the Force Awakens ended I couldn't wait to see what happened next now after this movie I really don't have any interest. I won't be going to the theater for any Future Star Wars movies I'll wait until they are on cable., 1.0,  Josh B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976943423/, January 24 2018,

 Those of you who rated this movie 5 stars should get your brain examined. Although most of you are Disney henchmen trying to drive the audience score back up I'm sure. This movie made me want to gouge my eyeballs out of my head and throw them at the screen. Luke is so out of character I'm just in total shock. Why would he even think about killing his nephew (even for a second) when he wouldn't even kill his Father in Return of the Jedi. Oh this movie makes my angry. More angry than the prequels made me. There are about 20000 more things wrong with this film but I wont bore you with details that thousands have already pointed out. Oh and hey to the critics that gave this steaming pile of trash 91%. All i can say is I hope the fat check by the new evil empire was big enough to cover the cost of your dignity.

 I think people are being really unfair when giving this a 1 star or even half a star rating. I have seen some VERY bad movies. I don't consider this the worst star wars movie. That spot is reserved for the Clone Wars and Rogue One (I can explain why I hate Rogue One so much) This is at least enjoyable as a movie. I do have legitimate complaints though. Some story wise and some disign wise. Like luke leaving early and not finishing his training with Yoda I feel like te director quite 2/3rds of the way and just made up the rest of the movie. He sets up these ideas and plot points in the first act of the movie that goes nowhere at the end. I had fun while in the theater but leaving a lot of things just had me asking "Well... what was the point?" <br>Is this a good star wars movie? No. Is this a good movie? No. Is it the worst movie I have ever seen? No. Just.... don't expect too much if you still havent seen it., 3.0,  Scothanial K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/919718442/, January 24 2018, 
 The Last Jedi is deceptive about what is happening in the film and that is why it has failed to impress audiences with it's ultimately pointless subplots. It was a refreshing look at the franchise and if it wasn't full of gotcha moments it would have been not only delivered properly but accepted by the general audience. The movie runs like a well done simple magic trick with obvious slight of hand to not frighten the audience in the twists presented. The simple solutions to highly complex problems that Star Wars is known for was tested and enjoyable to see our "heroes" fail but despite the gross failure they live suspending belief. The chances taken and the sacrifices are muted by the nameless off camera deaths death of a new character we don't connect with betrayal of a character we don't connect with and a forced love angle we recognize from Episode II or maybe more like from Swimfan. The film is tolerable and has few moments that are very memorable also leaving a cliffhanger that seems impossible to pick up from for the next installment. The actors are the best and worst parts of the film making me enjoy the ride at the same time being registering as annoying which is good acting for the character types presented. Though Rian changed Star Wars for a net positive hence my three stars he simultaneously made continuing the franchise trepidatious for fans., 3.0,  Francis M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/910736389/, January 24 2018,

 Very disappointed. The lack of character development and arc with Ray was frustrating. The fact that she knocked Luke down in the movie seemed out of place and conflicted with the complete absence of training or working for her powers. I guess these movies aren't about character arc and plot reveals any more and just about Disney princess powers., 1.0,  Bill H, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/944439647/, January 24 2018, 
 Fantastic visuals some good action scenes ... but a lot of gaping illogical plotholes (e.g.: Holdo not telling Poe about her plan...) many inconsistencies with the rest of the franchise (Forceghost-Yoda maipulating the weather ...) some uttery sensless scenes (Rose "saving" Finn from "saving" the Resistance Luke "milking" the strange alien and so on ...) and a general lack of knowledge (or utter disregard for) the "Star Wars"-Lore ... all in all the movie still had potential and visually it had some great scenes but the story was all over the place and in the end there was so much dissapointment: Snoke Rey's parents Luke the utter failure to present the first Order as something to be afraid of especially with Hux and (again) Phasma ... so much WASTED potential.<br>All it amounts to is a catastrophe for the franchise the lore ... and the fans., 0.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977068309/, January 24 2018, 
 I just watched this movie and came out with a smile on my face. Not quite as good as the Force Awakens but still a very good movie. An odd thing to say as there were a couple of things i did not like in the movie but it certainly was fresh. It was not what i was expecting and was all the better for it. A brave movie that took some risks and left us all on tenterhooks awaiting the final film.<br><br>I have read endless complaints from fans and i can see why people might take issue with some things in this movie but it is the middle part of a three part story. It needs time to breathe and i don't think you can really say its a complete failure until you see the conclusion. The makers of this movie should be praised for trying to break the mold and offer something different. I for one have no idea where part 3 will go...but that is exciting...!<br><br>I imagine if i came out of Empire in '81 i would have been scratching my head.<br><br>My problem with the prequels was that Lucas picked a path for Anakin and we knew where it was all going to end.

 Worst movie I have EVER seen! No questions were answered from TFA killed off the story line and made Luke look like an old fool. Disney made this as Disney as it could get. Star Wars is not a comedy and the OG Star Wars fans wanted an OG Star Wars film. It was set up for success and fell face after the opening scene.

 Re-submitted with one star as apparently 1/2 star reviews don't count on the audience score:<br><br>This Last Jedi is awful in so many ways as a Star Wars movie it is more of a parody as a stand alone movie it's just eye candy.<br><br>The downfall of this movie is that it was NOT made for fans of Star Wars. It was made to please a mainstream audience it's like a Marvel/DC action movie in a Star Wars skin. The story/plot is secondary instead we have a stunning visual spectacle that will dazzle the audience in the theatre but ultimately this movie will have no longevity. <br><br>Lazy writing/screenplay multiple scenes plagiarised from previous movies the plot is riddled with holes and inconsistencies. Political propaganda appalling poor/forced humour EVERY 5 MINUTES references to christian religion &amp swearing.This is NOT Star Wars.<br><br>This new direction may work in a stand alone Star Wars movie Rian Johnson said he wanted to "wipe the slate clean" very well do it in a spin off.

 Not sure what to feel about this movie. At first when walking out of the theater I was numb from shock of what I had just seen. This numbness slowly gave way to sadness as I realized that the core of Star Wars that I understood as a kid the concept of the Jedi as a ally of good and those that oppose the light were evil the hero's journey to overcome adversity and face evil head on is no longer alive or thriving. I was sad not just for me but for the new generation of people who will not enjoy sitting in a darkened theater to watch a story of awe and adventure unfold that would make you want to stand up and cheer. I was truly sad.<br><br>The more I thought about this movie the more I realized the writer/director and producer were working actively to systematically destroy the very heart of Star Wars and the more I examined the plot and the plot devices my sadness turned to anger. You could see the slow dismantling everywhere in the movie. Kylo tells Rey "Let the past die kill it if you have to" -- this line resonates throughout the entire movie and ultimatelyis what the movie is actually about. Kylo destroys his mask (the symbolic linkage between him and Darth Vader) effectively killing off any memory of Vader in the process Anikan's light saber explodes eliminating the link from the prequel a New Hope and Empire Strikes back and in doing so obliterates the any link that JJ Abrams had so cleverly setup in the Force Awakens the Jedi temple burned to the ground even the title the Last Jedi tries to rid the movie of the Jedi lore Luke even says clearly it is time for the Jedi to die and then there is Rey who as Yoda so calmly exclaims -- already knows everything completely obliterating the lore that to become a Jedi and proficient with the force (especially the light side) requires rigorous training and investment of time and focus. Then there was the atrocity of what Rian Johnson did with Luke's character -- nothing about Luke NOTHING resembles the character as he was developed in the story arc that started it all. Star Wars would not be Star Wars without Luke Skywalker. I was expecting Luke the character to be laid to rest within this trilogy at some point and was actually expecting it to happen in this movie -- but not like this not in the way he was so callously disposed of ... brushed aside transformed into a premeditating child murdering coward as a person who rejected everything he had all his life prior held so dear -- family friends seeking truth and good in the galaxy. Combing the internet and finding Mark Hamill's inputs via interviews and public statements then you could hear it in Hamill's voice in the interviews you could see it in his face in the post premier video/shots. He was devastate as were many of the true Star Wars fans who thought of Luke as the example of good of a flawed farm-boy who rose to become a Jedi.<br><br>This movie was not only detrimental to Star Wars it is the dagger (light saber) in the heart of the mythos -- it effectively kills Star Wars as many of us know it. This movie wasn't just 'not a Star Wars movie' as many have stated in these comments and elsewhere no this movie is Anti-Star Wars. The underlying goal was to literally obliterate the world of Star Wars .... and for what? To make way for something new and different? Or was it to push some other message? It is truly sad as no other movie trilogy in the history of Cinema has become so central to American culture as what the original Star Wars trilogy had become and I wonder if that was not the ultimately goal -- to bring down classic American culture or at least be a part of that movement. <br><br>Sadly Kathleen Kennedy (and apparently) Rian Johnson will go on to continue this slaughter of a once iconic American franchise. Apparently Kennedy loved what Johnson has created so much that she has granted him his own Star Wars trilogy -- even more sadly the behemoth that Star Wars is in the minds of so many will generate revenue when it does not deserve it. My only solace is they will do it without my 15 bucks. I am done with it ... this is The Last Star Wars for me., 1.0,  Jack S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977069888/, January 24 2018,

 Disney's efforts at manipulating audience scores (and therefore luring more people to the theaters) should be exposed and investigated. We are talking about massive fraud.<br>The reviews are public and I am talking about FACTS. And fact is that in correspondence to the opening of The Last Jedi and following days the reviews and scores on Rotten Tomatoes Metacritics and IMDB were ALL positive giving the movie the maximum score.<br>After the movie screening finished the critics and the ratings went down like a giant lead ball. How come?<br>Fact is that lots of people look at the audience critics before going to Cinemas and decide consequently. <br>Disney paid a number of individuals (maybe an entire call-center) to flood the critics sites with positive and enthusiastic (although one-liners) critics and extremely high scores.<br>When screening ended they had no need to inflate the score anymore and the REAL critics and scores started to get in. Now they are ALL negative (except a very few one-liners that look extremely suspicious).<br>So what? Shame on you! Disney! You knew from the very beginning that this movie was a shit. This only explains the massive campaign you paid for at the very beginning of the screening. A campaign which you stopped abruptly as soon as your goal was accomplished. <br>I hope you will regret bitterly your deliberate (and inexplicable) destruction of an entire universe., 1.0,  Amilyn H, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977071192/, January 24 2018,

 It's been interesting to watch Disney's disaster recovery tactics evolve over the past month. From having reviewers post one-liners lauding the film with a 5 star rating they have moved on to more sophisticated tactics. Now we can see reviews that are negative about the film yet rate it 3 stars or more. <br><br>This site aggregates the score by looking how many people rate the moviee 2.5 stars or less verus how many people rate is 3 stars or more. The Audience Score of 49% which the website display currently basically means that 51% of people rated the movie with 2.5 stars or less. So any review that is 3 stars or more is bumping up the score. <br><br>How nifty.. have a reviewer seemingly disapprove of the movie yet score it positively. <br><br>DISNEY people have become too smart for these tactics - we are all on the internet too much and see and hear too much. Stop with the nonsense. Stop with the justifications. Acknowledge this movie sucked fire Kathleed and Rian and get on with it. <br><br>My origial review below: <br>---------------------------<br>Disappointing story line development... Star Wars is not a super hero movie but Disney doesn't seem to understand that. I don't think they know what the actual appeal of these stories has been for so many years and so many generations.<br><br>I walked away from the theater with a weird feeling of 'what did i just watch'. When a friend asked me how the movie was knowing my excitement prior to the premiere I stayed silent for a while before slowly responding 'it was Ok but...' and not being able to finish. My initial review on Rotten Tomatoes was 2.5 stars - i liked the visuals and music but was utterly disappointed with the story. Now after having given it more thought I can't give it more than 1 star. <br><br>There are major flaws in the basic premise of the action that is shown on screen - two spaceships chase each other for 18 hours waiting for our heroes to run out of gas ?! I can't believe how anyone tought that this would be fun to watch. Fast and the Furious movies at least make car chases exciting this was literally a straight chase between two scape ships which took more than an hour of screen-time. I was sitting in the theater feeling bored and realized I had never ever felt bored watching a Star Wars movie. Even after rewaching them for the tenth time.<br>Then we have gravity in space? and the girl which needs to activate the bombs being exposed to space without it affecting her in any way? then Leia being exposed to space and freezing and somehow saving herself? I mean these are just really weird absurdities of the plot but the thing that is the core of the problem is that this movie has no message for us whatsoever. <br><br>Star Wars is a unique franchise which has in the past 40 years assembled a fan base of all ages. There is a reason for that. The Star Wars movies besides being fun action-packed and awe-inspiring grand scale theatrical feats are movies with a profound story and a message. <br><br>The original movies raised the question 'what is evil?' 'is all evil the same?' 'how unconditionally should you love?'. It showed the difference between being evil (emperor) and doing evil (darth vader) and they showed us that unconditional love can redeem (luke).<br><br>The prequels showed how evil plays all sides for its own gain of total control and destruction (you have to admire the planning and plotting of palpatine to play everyone against one another). It showed that evil revels in suffering. It showed us to be wary of false praise and accept some limitations placed on us by those that are there to guide us toward adulthood. Even with Jar Jar Binks and the clinical CGI of the prequels its messages were profound and watching Anakin fall to the Dark side still saddens me every time. <br><br>These are movies that as a mother I want to show my kids. So that we can have a fun family time but also because it allows me to ask them to think about what the stories teach.<br><br>What exactly is Disney's message to us with these new Star Wars releases (The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi)? They seem to think that Star Wars is another Marvel comic. "Let's get the band together to blow some shit up!" <br>No! No! No! <br>Do they really think that anyone will show the Avengers movies to their kids in 40 years time like people do and have been doing for decades with Star Wars? <br><br>Avengers are fun and action packed-movies that I go and watch in the cinema as well but they are so utterly forgettable. And they are made in that way. We are not there in the cinema to care but to be entertained. Star Wars is an entirely different franchise and I can't believe how badly Disney has missed this point. <br><br>I would like to sit down with Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy and get their input on what the message is of the Last Jedi? It's so shallow. Rose and Finn are happy to free animals and make a statement about animal cruelty while leaving little kids enslaved? Rose saves Finn because we should 'save what we love and not kill what we hate' while by saving Finn she dooms all the other rebels hiding in the cave... yes let's just be selfish and save only the ones we have a crush on and let the rest perish... wtf?! Are the good guys and the bad guys all the same because they all buy weapons to destroy one another? 'No you're wrong' says Finn and that's the end of that message. Very convincing... <br><br>The other thing that is so infuriating is how Disney just threw away the original cast. I mean these are iconic characters and this was the very last chance we had to see them together on screen to send them off with a loving and grand goodbye. Instead Disney has brought them back on the screen to kill them off and disgrace them. There is not one scene where Luke Leia and Han are together. We hardly get Chewbacca. The opportunity to do this right is now lost forever. I can't believe the sheer stupidity of the people writing the scripts. <br><br>The thing that saddens me is that the magic which I felt thinking about Star Wars and waiting for the next release is completely gone. I see that this franchise is now owned by people who are out to earn money first and foremost and it killed all the yearning I had to see the story unfold. I won't be seeing the next Star Wars releases in theater. If I watch it at all it will be on tv. <br>I have thought about what could make me have hope again for this franchise and it would be to have Lucas on board with whatever the new releases are.

 An utter character assassination on Luke Skywalker. It was like that episode of South Park with Spielberg and Lucas doing unspeakable things to Indiana Jones but worse. This went on for two and a half snooze-inducing hours. Boring and inconsequential subplots that have no relation to the main conflict. Extensive cross-cutting. Cheap humor at the expense of the lore. Rey's journey is bland as a shaved potato. Waste. Hubris. Idiocy. No answers or respect for the past films. No understanding of mythology. Tone-deaf dialogue and boring direction. Lazy cinematography and choreography. This is the worst Star Wars film and I am done with Disney Star Wars. It's no longer canon to me and this is the last time I'm paying to see anything produced by Disney in theaters ever. Give me 200 million dollars and I would have made a far better movie than this piece of trash. The Porgs were cute though. <br><br>PS.: I say all this as a former big fan of Rian Johnson's past 3 films and someone who has followed his career closely.

 This is not the film I was looking for...<br>Rian Johnson seems to want to clarify all aspects of this film in great detail. However it's unfortunate that he didn't make the effort to do it in the actual film especially as much of what was set up in The Force Awakens had been discarded without a second thought.<br>Simply put the film is a mess. It's badly executed with forced (no pun intended) jarring humour some ropey decision making by the characters whereby little of the set up in the film pays off and plot holes so big you wonder whether some bad writing has disjointed the film.<br>The prequels were bad this is on a similar par. Big disappointment after the success of rogue one..., 2.0,  Nick L, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/946325041/, January 23 2018, 
 As a lifelong Star Wars fan I could give a long winded review of this film but there are plenty of those out there that are far better written than anything I could come up with. I saw this opening night with an extremely positive attitude. Despite my major problems with The Force Awakens I was truly hoping for the best. Maybe Rian Johnson could deliver us a truly amazing film. Yes these new films are about continuing the story of the new characters but I have to be honest..my main excitement was to see Luke Skywalker again a character so many of us had loved for years and decades and this was the film we had been waiting for. Leaving the theater my genuine displeasure was downright crippling. As a hardcore fan of the original trilogy as well as novels comics and other media I can honestly say this is the most disappointing film in the franchise's history. To be plain and straightforward the amount of bad outweighs the good by so much its astounding. Yes there are some redeeming scenes in this film..but that does not make up for what I feel is a complete lackluster movie. Disney doesn't seem to want to show these original characters that MADE Star Wars so beloved the respect they deserve. The ridiculously out of place humor and plot holes galore just add to the mess that is The Last Jedi. I truly fear for the future of Star Wars and that saddens me more than I can say., 1.0,  Alex P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977057816/, January 23 2018, 
 (Warning possible spoilers)<br>This is the worst Star Wars movie ever created. I thought they could not make a worse movie than the Phantom Menace but Disney has done it! The story in the Last Jedi is horribly written every time a character is introduced they hint at a backstory but never do any exposition after they are introduced. A few examples of this is Snoke whose existence/history is mysteriously never explained and Vice Admiral Holdo whom Poe Dameron is surprised by after he meets her but the movie fails to explain why. This is a theme in the movie so if you want an explanation for anything look elsewhere. There are a few instances where the movie goes a bit deeper and the results are disturbing. I don't remember the exact line but one of the resistance members muses about killing a group of people on a planet they visit because they aren't very nice people. The movie also seems to glorify martyrdom through the sacrifices that recur throughout the movie. Luke Skywalker was a character I was excited to see in the new movie but I was disappointed at his portrayal as a weak bitter old man who reluctantly agrees to teach Rey the ways of the force. Although this is one of the only reasons he's in the movie he is non-existant as a teacher and fails to impart any knowledge at all despite being a Jedi Master. It's ok though Rey is naturally gifted enough that she knows exactly how to do everything after a single lesson from Luke. He is treated as a throwaway character when he could have been so much more. The special effects in this movie are great probably the one good thing about it., 1.0,  Jeremy W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977070985/, January 23 2018,

 A sad waste of so much good material. Plot holes everywhere. Unbelievable inconstant characters. Completely stupid pointless subplots that made the movie too long riddled with a bunch of not so subtle hitting of the audience on the head with a moral broom on topics like slavery and animal cruelty. The director consistently mocks the audience by repeatedly pointing out that what you thought would happen won't your hopes and expectations are meaningless and everything the story set up in the past doesn't matter. In essence everything is pointless everything is wishy woshy and flippy floppy and nothing matters.<br><br>What a mess., 0.5,  Tam A, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977071016/, January 23 2018, 
 To be honest. The Force Awakens was a blow out as far as story and cinematography. The Last Jedi was visually astonishing but falls back into what made episodes 1-3 so bad.

 **SPOILERS AHEAD**<br>This movie was terrible. I've never written a review on this site and I'm sure many other people will have the same complaints that I do but I feel the need to post this anyway. How is this movie a 91% with these genius critics? Were they paid off by the all powerful mouse?<br><br>This movie mainly tries to force feed SJW/political/feminist BS down your throat instead of actually telling a coherent Star Wars story. Rey is never developed as a character and her parents were apparently nobody after all the hype that was built over her origin. Just an abrupt dismissal of her being linked to someone cool. But still she can beat powerful Jedi with no training and without breaking a sweat. Kylo is somewhat fleshed out as a character but these sequels have still made him look incredibly weak compared to Darth Vader (Can you imagine Vader being made to look like a b***h by the emperor and then getting beaten by someone with no force training??). It took Luke 3 movies years of training and all the willpower he had to beat Vader plus his sister being threatened.<br><br>Finn and Rose are the main SJW characters with an absurdly stupid side plot that did nothing and probably took like 40 minutes of screen time ( at least it felt that long). I like Poe's character but they tried to make him look dumb in this movie when really he was acting rationally in the face of seeming suicidal stupidity of the purple haired (yes seriously) female captain. <br><br>Snoke was killed off in a really dumb way with once again no reveal of his backstory. Leia Poppins flies in outer space instead of dying with dignity. Luke's character is butchered with him even saying so himself in interviews. Yoda shows up to validate burning ancient Jedi texts because you know they've got Rey now. Duh. There was also way too much forced humor that was completely unnecessary for a Star Wars movie. <br><br>The list goes on and on but I'll stop there. Save your money. Don't see this in theaters and don't buy the blu ray. Stop feeding these Disney whores that like vampires will extract every ounce of blood from the corpse of a proven money maker. I for one am DONE with this franchise and will not be giving them any more of my hard earned money., 1.0,  Ryan H, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977070942/, January 23 2018, 
 Rian John and Kathleen Kennedy should be ashamed of themselves for ruining a franchise that has lasted 40 years. The only people who liked this movie are the types that don't think much and are easily amused by bread and circuses or those that were more tied up in the subversive political messaging that runs amok in this film.<br><br>This movie should be struck from canon and remade. It's that bad. It's not just the political messaging. It's the storytelling that doesn't make any sense. The movie is filled with so many plot holes and inexplicable actions and decisions that any thinking reviewer should walk out going "Wait... what???" I started listing them out here but this post got so long and I hadn't even scratched the surface.<br><br>No - this movie is trash.

 If you really cherished the originals for their characters creative storytelling and myth is then you will not like the last Jedi. This movie set out to literally kill the past and spit it. The story was subpar void of what makes good SW movie great. If you are looking for a great lightsaber battle or a blaster battle with stormtroopers or even a hero from the past without all the baggage of reality and OC dumpedi on top of them you will not find it in this movie. Awful just awful if you try to fit it in the long spectrum of the SW saga. Like a puzzle piece that doesn't fut or doesn't belong.

 Huge disappointment. I am a long-time Star Wars fan but not what I would necessarily describe as a hardcore one I liked the original trilogy didn't care for the prequels thought TFA was a good palate cleanser to get back to the optimism of star wars and enjoyed Rogue One for what it was.<br><br>I left the theater utterly disappointed after seeing TLJ. After almost a month my reaction has moved from disappointment to anger and contempt.<br><br>This is not just a bad Star Wars movie. It is a bad movie.<br><br>The plot makes very little sense. There are gaping holes in logic and rationale. The idea of a space bomber that relies on gravity to work. Holdo/Leia not telling their CAG Poe what their plan is. Space Mary Poppins. The failure to use the two freighters that they know will run out of fuel first as weapons. The fact that Holdo stayed on the main ship (ostensibly to pilot it even though she was just sitting around and any droid could have done the same) passively watched shuttles get destroyed and only after they were almost all gone decided to ram the first order ship. What a stroke of fortune that the surviving shuttle contained the characters the movie cared about!<br><br>The humor is forced and ill-fitting. The casino planet served no purpose other than to provide a very muddled tremendously hamfisted attempt at social commentary. The brand new characters (Rose Holdo) serve little to no purpose except to remove agency from Poe and Finn respectively. The ability to completely waste having Laura Dern in your film merits mention all of its own. The acting in general which has admittedly never been a strong point of the franchise hits new lows.<br><br>But my largest complaints are reserved for the plot decisions they chose to make.<br><br>I don't even care that much that they ruined Luke's character except that it was totally unnecessary. Literally the ONLY reason that bit was included was to make Kylo Ren seem like he might be redeemable and join with Rey... and then they stomped out that possibility within twenty minutes. So what was the value of destroying a character for a plot point that didn't even survive the movie?<br><br>Apart from the terrible writing that's my biggest issue with the movie exactly how many of the decisions made were unnecessary. If you take it as a given that the goals of the movie were (a): kill off Luke and put the focus back on the new characters (b) strip down the resistance to the barest essentials and (c) put kylo in command of the first order those goals were all achievable without so many boneheaded decisions.<br><br>Instead they tarnished Luke's legacy they changed Poe into the sort of moron who consistently gets everyone following him killed they took away any agency or capability whatsoever from Finn (who accomplishes nothing in the film other than exposing the resistance's already terrible escape plan and being prevented from heroically sacrificing himself by pointless write-in Rose) and they wiped out any of the mystery surrounding Rey leaving... what exactly? A young woman who is inexplicably good at everything has no backstory and hasn't had any character development in two movies?<br><br>Through Marvel Disney does a good job of shepherding their MCU movies and making sure they build off of each other and support the larger storyline. It's a pity they couldn't do the same with Star Wars. It's a pity they thought it was a good idea to give the second movie in the trilogy to a director who so clearly had no interest in building off the first movie. It's a pity I no longer have any interest at all in seeing episode IX.<br><br>All of the excitement and hope that TFA brought back after the very mediocre prequels is gone.<br><br>But hey... at least the increasingly out-of-touch critics liked it., 1.0,  Xsi K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/963706098/, January 23 2018, 
 Passable at best. I walked out of the theater not really sure of what I had just witnessed. The following morning I woke up with this dirty feeling just clinging to me. It's kind of like that feeling you have after a one-night stand that you know shouldn't have gone through with. I can't saw it was an awful experience but I'm kind of regretting it now in the aftermath. There were moments of pure brilliance that were somehow meshed into an otherwise contrived and unfocused plot. The humor felt entirely out of place a number throughout most of the film. Forced humor is the worst kind you know sitcom-level kind and I was almost expecting to hear a laugh track. Might not have been a bad idea either because during my screening very few laughs were heard. My intent here is not to go into a deep dissection but just to make a few points. The movie is a disjointed mess. The flow felt totally off. There are absolute lapses in logic. Characters that should have stayed alive are killed without fanfare and characters that should have died are miraculously still alive. The First Order is portrayed as if they're bumbling novices that haven't even completed their military training and yet somehow they're meant to be seen as a legitimate threat. The good guys are almost always portrayed as being "better fighters" in Star Wars but it felt absolutely lopsided here. There was an unnecessary side plot that was added in for padding. And yet I still saw traces of what was probably at one time a solid film that would have echoed the greatness of its forebears. I've actually loved Disney's handling of Star Wars since they took it over. I saw Force Awakens and Rogue One in theaters multiple times so I'm not some Disney hater quite the opposite. I don't know if it was studio meddling or a poor director at the helm but this one completely missed the mark. That said there were some great performances. Ridley Hammill and Driver were great on-screen and their scenes and character development (for the most part) were what kept me engaged. Is it the worst film of all time? No not even close. I was just horribly disappointed by it and I'm now concerned as to the direction my favorite franchise of all time is heading in., 1.5,  Matthew G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976933682/, January 23 2018,

 Rian Johnson should rot in hell. I would give no stars if I could. He screwed this up on a colossal level. That is not the Luke Skywalker we all know and love. Mark Hamil's performance was great. He is a fine actor. The story was just stupid. And don't get me started about the porgs. There should have been a clause in Disney's contract that if they did something incredibly stupid they would have to return the franchise to George Lucas.

 I created an account just to review this movie. It should have been a slam dunk. The only way to ruin the original Star Wars characters was to attack the things that made them lovable and memorable. This is what the Last Jedi has done. They have made me dislike the Star Wars franchise and have no interest in future films. On top of that it is infused with social politics which means I will not let my kids see the films either.<br><br>I had been telling all my friends that since Disney had spent billions for the rights to Star Wars that they would surely hire the best writers and fill the ranks with lifelong fans of the characters. Oh how wrong I was. The only reason I can think of for why Disney would actively try to destroy the affection fans had for the series is that George Lucas must still hold the merchandising rights to characters from the original series. They probably thought that every minute they spent on the original characters was merchandising potential being lost for their new characters. And so they must have tried to make people dislike the characters and then kill them since their treatment of Luke Han Leia and Ackbar is so unbelievably disrespectful. Also the irony of Disney attacking capitalism and wealthy people is astounding. <br><br>I was shocked at how we never got to see a reunion scene with the original cast and felt the scenes given to them were deliberately bland. But I thought I could forgive that because TLJ will let us see Luke go out in a grand send off. My jaw hit the floor when I saw what they did with his character. It made me angry. Disney actually hates Star Wars fans. What a sad turn of events that such a huge cultural mainstay has been subverted by partisan ideologues. <br><br>The worst of it is they seem to have forgotten how to tell a basic story. There characters don't progress and story doesn't advance. The Last Jedi begins with the "rebels" being chased and ends that way. I believe this is a metaphor for how Disney views the franchise. A never ending chase for your wallets that will continue as long as they keep giving gullible audiences cool CGI battles and stories and characters that you will forget after you step out of the theater. The only way they could fix this is by stating that the Last Jedi was a propaganda film made by the First Order and then tell us what really happens.

 A good stand alone movie with great acting by main characters and an interesting plot line. That being said it's a horrible star wars movie. Completely takes a dump on all the Star Wars mythos that came before it with the original trilogy AND takes a dump on the direction of The Force Awakens. I was sitting there at the end thinking WTF?? And WHY??? Bottom line if you're not a Star Wars fan (like my wife) you'll love it. If you are a Star Wars fan (like me) it will disappoint especially with Luke., 0.5,  Zeppelin L, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976956812/, January 23 2018, 
 Well this whole mess of a movie has exposed that Disney pays off film critics and that Rotten Tomatoes is complicit by turning a blind eye from this scandal along with keeping the audience score at an artificial high score. It does not take a Mathematician to calculate that the audience score should be tops in the 30% area but more likely in the 20% basement. <br> The only reason that the film grosses over $1 billion is that any new Star Wars film has a built-in audience but look further and the box office figures show that the fans hated this film. So far TLJ has grossed over $771 million LESS worldwide and $331 million LESS domestic (U.S.) than TFA. If this film was even decent it should have had similar numbers than TFA but since it is awful the figures are disappointing.<br> Disney's strategy was obviously to shove down PC and pro-women rubbage down the viewers' throats. They were to first have Han dominate in the first of the new trilogy then hit the dirt then Luke would take the stage in Round 2 before bowing out and then Leia would finish off the trilogy and bite the dust in the third film.<br> Well cocaine and heroin got in the way of Fisher returning to the next film. I don't know why Leia was given more exposure than Luke and Han considering that in the original three classics those two dominated the films. Fisher is a marginal actress to begin with. At this stage in her career she is a mediocre amateur.<br> Everything to do with Leia in the new trilogy has been dull as common sense science and any semblance of logic has obliterated. She should have been the first character to go.<br> To put a mediocre director/writer like Johnson to handle a Star Wars film is beyond ludicrous. At most he is a vanilla TV director. What was Disney thinking? <br> Why are white guys all bad and the girls the "heroes" of the story? Disney is a joke how they drag the PC garbage out there while mostly MEN run the entertainment division and the company is a corporate raider gobbling up products and companies left and right. TLJ makes commercialism and corporations evil while Johnson's salary on the film is more than every employee's yearly working earnings in Disneyland combined! Disney treats its employees awful with near slave wages while the corporate big shots make $10 to $50 million along with multi-million stock options each year. Kathleen Kennedy and the no-talent Rian Johnson will be laughing all the way to Fort Knox with their earnings.<br> Disney is trying to make Rey the next Disney princess by having her become the strongest Jedi of all time with no training!<br> Why is Disney messing with Star Wars by adding boring characters and discarding memorable ones? If it is to sell more toys how is that possible when Star Wars ARE THE BIGGEST SELLING TOY SERIES IN HISTORY!!!!!<br> To get the Star War fans back into the theaters for the third film they must bring back Luke and Han. That can't be done - or can it? They suspended so much logic in this past film with Rey becoming the super Jedi and Leia floating in out space that to bring back the two fan favorites is possible. They can explain everything away.<br> This film made no sense. Mark Hamill was right in his observation of how his character is raped in this film. Of course the Disney head honchos grabbed hold of him and he had to back track on his comments.<br> Give Hamill credit for giving the best performance in this film in a role that was terrible. Luke Skywalker is the hero of heroes. He would never have buried himself like a hermit on the island while the galaxy goes to hell. He was a fearless warrior but in TLJ they wanted to make Rey the hero while Luke takes a back seat. <br> The whole movie was a joke. How many resistance members are left - around 12? <br> Disney tried to insult the intelligence of Star Wars fans. Sure they fooled some and bought the critics but as said before the box office figures don't lie. <br> Bring back Han! Bring back Luke! More C3PO R2D2 and more Chewie and maybe the trilogy can be saved. If not then the next film will be a resounding flop.<br> Are you geniuses at Disney hearing us out the galaxy?, 1.0,  John R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977070430/, January 23 2018,

 After seeing the movie I had a really mixed and confused feeling. A visually stunning ride for sure but something really didn't feel right. The way Luke was handled felt totally out of character.<br><br>After giving it some weeks thoughts I have concluded that I think it's a really bad movie all in all. For reasons stated here by others. I will just mention that I really really hate the way they went with Luke pissing on his character and legacy. The writers must really have hated him why would they otherwise throw in such a disturbing scene as the one where he's milking blue milk from alien tits and then drink it with mad lunatic eyes. WTF WAS THAT??!<br><br>Also big minus for not giving a fuck about previous established lore and throwing away everything set up in TFA.<br><br>Point given for the visuals music and good to great performances by the actors. But a terrible terrible script.<br><br>I find it hard to believe that I will see ep 9 in cinemas after this  probably wait until DVD.

 I am yet another person who registered an account just to review this movie as I am still dumbfounded how it was written acted directed produced edited and released without anyone saying: hang on this is Star Wars not some random sci-fi teenage battle flick maybe this does not quite meet the standard required by that franchise.<br><br>I will not rehash all the faults as they have been eloquently set out in the many previous reviews (mess of plot juvenile humour boring characters unnecessary SJW messaging...). I will however repeat what has also been said many times before: this has killed my enthusiasm for future Star Wars releases and even damaged my nostalgic love for the older ones. <br><br>Again how did people whose only job is to produce movies not see this coming??, 1.0,  Stephen D, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977032993/, January 23 2018, 
 Rian Johnson took all the lore created in Force Awakens crapped on it then smeared it all over 2 and a half hours of film. This movie did not feel like star wars. It felt more like a guardians of the galaxy movie. The director gave no respect to the pacing or lore of any of the previous movies and sucked the life right out of the franchise. JJ Abrams really has his work cut out for him saving this mess. This movie ranks right down there with Phantom Menace. Help us JJ Abrams you're our only hope! Updated from 2 stars to 1. The more I think about this movie the more I hate it. First star wars movie that I didn't see multiple times.

 Avid Star Wars fan my entire life. Collected action figures as a kid made fan films as far back as 1982. Loved this movie. It is not about remaining loyal to a character or validating fan theories about who is what. It is about the Force. As Luke said it is arrogance to think that anyone "owns" the force. It is not about any one person or group of people. It is bigger that all of that and that is what this movie is about., 5.0,  Rex P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977070197/, January 23 2018,

 I have been a Star Wars fan since I was 10 and this is the first movie in the entire series that left me completely cold. The film is heartbreakingly bad and features all of the director Rian Johnson's worst impulses.

 The absolute worst Star Wars movie EVER made (if you dare call this Star Wars)... Absolute SJW sexist anti-male Bullshit that ruins the entire (movie).. Cannot believe how they RUINED Luke Skywalker how they made an interesting character (Snoke) into a useless filler character with no background and with no importance whatsoever ! HUGE plot holes and Terrible writing makes this (movie..) a huge pile of rubbish. Keep your filthy political agendas and sexist hate out of movies please if you cannot do that don't make any movies at all ! This (movie..) is a total insult to any (real) Star Wars fans except the ones who know nothing about Star Wars and grew to like Jar Jar... ONE star for me and it's forced because apparently half star ratings do not count so... This (movie..) does offer good music and CGI effects the only redeemable quality !, 1.0,  Lumia R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977070129/, January 23 2018, 
 The Last Jedi Review:<br>The latest instalment in the Star Wars canon is a well-shot and unexpected adventure yet the films flaws greatly overshadow these few inspiring moments. Right away Rian Johnson's imprint is obvious with the dazzling shots of the opening space battle. The comedic elements of the film will drive many members of the audience mad with the puzzling phone exchange between General Hux and Poe setting the tone for the rest of the film. The story is very bland with the First Order embarking on a final chase to destroy the Resistance once and for all. General Leia has limited screen time and although Carrie Fisher brings a strong performance to the role there is great disappoint in this being her last hurrah in the iconic role. This is greatly summed up with her "Mary Poppins" like scene in the vacuums of space. Poe is once again one of the standouts of the new crew but is strongly misused as he only features on the main resistance ship following his epic opening sequence. Finn is the comic relief once again but this time he embarks on a journey with the newcomer Rose. Despite Rose's heroic actions she feels like she was forced into the story. Finn's role in this movie is arguably the biggest waste of space as his failed mission is irrelevant to the plot as a whole. The casino scenes serve as hidden political messages and tack on unnecessary screen time to the longest movie in the franchise. Daisy Ridley is solid as Rey and has strong relations with both Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) but her training sessions are minimal and she is still a sparkling example of a Mary-sue. Mark Hamill gives a solid performance but the portrayal of Luke in this film will anger many fans as this was nothing like his character from the original trilogy. Adam Driver is frustrating as the conflicted Kylo Ren but his relations with Rey provide the most interesting elements of the film specifically the fight with the guards. The under developments of Snoke and Phasma are some of the most frustrating elements of the film as they were built up to be major characters during the Force Awakens. Snoke's past is never touched on and Phasma once again receives limited screen time mimicking the silliness of Boba Fett's death in Return of the Jedi. This is down to the inconsistency and lack of communication between the writers on where the story should be heading. The third act is non-stop but often very frustrating and mimics elements from the original trilogy too closely. Overall The Last Jedi is a well-shot and different type of Star Wars film however the plot holes underdeveloped characters and unnecessary sequences overshadow the few positive elements. I give props for Rian Johnson for leaving his mark in Star Wars however it is very underwhelming and will divide fans greatly over the where the franchise goes from here. <br><br>I would give The Last Jedi a 5 out of 10., 2.5,  Lewis C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977070110/, January 23 2018, 
 Yes it had it's problems.

 What a huge giant turd of a (movie) that is if you even dare call that a movie and not a political statement and pure sexism. I'm a female have been a Star Wars fan for a LONG time and I can tell you now it is dead. They destroyed Luke Skywalker they destroyed Snoke they... Destroyed every male character actually (except for Fin he stays a coward and useless as always ! Leia is now Superman Luke now uses powers maybe Dr. Strange (might) be able to do feminist Mary Sue is now more powerful than Palpatine ever was considering he was limited because he was a bad evil white male... Bogus irrelevant Chinese chick comes in and somehow falls in love with the most useless character around in a new record for amount of time taken. The plot holes (should we even dare call them holes at this point?) when the (holes are bigger than Jupiter I don't call them (holes) anymore those are more numerous than actual living beings in the entire Galaxy.. Yes there is action yes the CGI is great and I guess that's all that counts for the level of I.Q in people today.... If you are a Star Wars fan stay far FAR away from this turd ! If you are a not too brilliant drone of a person that likes shiny things lots of pew pews Mary Sue (s) anti male corny out of nowhere out of place jokes and humor this (movie) is for you ! Did I mention they actually find a way to screw up even Yoda too ? When Ewoks and Jar Jar make their movies look like the kind of movie that would get 100 Oscars there's a problem ! Keep Politics and B.S political correctness and such garbage out of movies and sagas please but even more important keep your mind boggingly obvious sexism out of movies as well especially Star Wars.... Actually nvm you just destroyed that and admit it it was your intention all along and now you are all excited about it ! 0.5/5 for me ! BOOOOOO Disney ! BOOOOO Lucasfilm plz fire that sexist ... you have as director called Kat... Ken... I won't name her she who shall not be named !

 This garbage has completely turned me off of any future Star Wars movies. I have zero investment in any characters that remain in this series and don't care what happens in the future with this franchise. Congrats to Rian and Kathleen you turned something that you could count on Billions of $ for years to come into a series that will fall apart now that you have effectively eliminated roughly half of the fan base. Worst Star Wars movie ever terrible story what are supposed to be fan favorite characters now have no emotional connection to many fans any longer so I imagine a huge drop in ticket sales for Episode IX I know who's money they won't be getting.

 Unfortunately it was what I had thought. The movie was fairly flashy and action packed but the story wasn't very strong.

 Good moments come here and there and while I love Yoda's appearance in the film the rest is filled with inconstancies. The part that bothers me the most though is the general portrayal of Luke. Luke has been built up to be someone who was able to turn Darth Vader whom almost everybody including his master saw is irredeemable. This all gets thrown out the window in Last Jedi where Luke doesn't care about the Jedi order. The only seen where he wasp portrayed in a way that at least ties in with the other trilogies is the one with Yoda., 1.5,  Max M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977070910/, January 23 2018, 
 This movie is filled with great opportunities that are so poorly executed. Filled with ham-fisted humour that fell flat in the theatre in place of dialogue. The film doesn't deliver on developing interesting character arcs instead leaving the audience with more questions than answers. It short-changes so many intriguing characters to give it's vast array of empty characters more screen time. The franchise is feeling extremely tainted by Disney's influence and outside of the shiny space-battles this film leaves a lot to be desired., 0.5,  Jimmy K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977070907/, January 23 2018,

 LOOK AT THE PROFILES OF PEOPLE LEAVING POSITIVE REVIEWS!!!!! I've noticed a few that were started within the past month or two that only have 0-2 other reviews and they're all for movies that suck or aren't doing well in theaters. Shills indeed.<br><br>Heard a rumor that Rotten Tomatoes doesn't count half-star reviews so I'm changing mine to a 1 star. Still counts negatively towards the audience score so no harm in pretending like this movie is better than it actually is.<br><br>And to the people saying that others on here are just giving it a low score because "reasons" you are incredibly stupid individuals. This movie is not liked and people came here to share their opinion just as you. People have been very clear about what it is that they didn't like about this movie and you are patently ignoring everything they've said when you accuse them of maliciously attacking this film. You're either a very stupid and/or dishonest individual or you're a Disney shill (who are also stupid and dishonest people). Quit attacking people who are trying to share their opinion about this movie you're only making people hate this movie more because of your alienating attitude.<br><br>Here is a copy of the email I sent to Disney regarding this movie:<br><br>"Hi I just wanted someone at Disney to know how angry I was after seeing The Last Jedi. <br><br>I never expected a movie to get to me so much but what you have put out is utter garbage. I can't believe that a company would spend $4 billion to get their hands on a property only to slap their story together with paste and scotch tape instead of taking the time to do something good with it. Why did you not spend a year or two developing the plot of all three movies? Why did you let Rian Johnson write this one by himself instead of hiring qualified writers or having JJ Abrams work on the script with him? <br><br>Also I'm almost positive that your company is responsible for strong-arming and/or bribing critics into giving positive reviews as well as hiring shills to talk this movie up on message boards. The disparity in the Rotten Tomatoes scores is damning and many of the positive audience reviews on that site seem very insincere in their praises. I find the thought of your company manipulating critics in order to trick people into liking terrible movies offensive and while I'm now wary of paying to see Disney films because of this suspicion I will fully boycott your company if it is publicly revealed to be true. I would join in any class action lawsuit against you that arose from that as I feel I would not have seen this movie when I did if it hadn't been for all the positive press it was getting. Not to mention the attempted damage control that showed up in the media was jaw-droppingly out-of-touch and insulting. I am not a bot I am not a racist or sexist person and in fact didn't ever once focus on the gender or race of the characters as that has no bearing on whether a not a film is good. People resented this movie for pandering to people obsessed with identity politics not the fact that it contained diversity. I do not believe for one second that your company is not responsible for at least some of these libelous articles that are aimed at the very people you hope to have see your next movie. Do you really think people are going to start liking something because someone else called them a bigot for not liking it? What a shitty way to repay people who have given you money for something you obviously couldn't care less about. If I'm wrong and you had nothing to do with insulting your ticket-buying audience then it would have been prudent of you to have put out a statement IMMEDIATELY denouncing such articles and at least admitting that the movie was not for everyone. All that's happened now is that your audience is further alienated and these publications have lost credibility among people who legitimately didn't like The Last Jedi. If you look at the current Rotten Tomato audience review score that seems to be the majority now. If you did hire shills you know it should be much lower too.<br><br>I wanted to let you know that I will not be going to the theater to see any more Star Wars movies put out by your corporation in the future. The Last Jedi killed Star Wars for me and I can't think of a better phrase with which to express my disappointment. You. Killed. Star. Wars. Others are with me and while we might not be enough people to make you actually care about the quality and consistency of the products you put out we are enough people that you are going to see Solo and Episode IX be the two lowest grossing Star Wars movies of all time. If IX is any good I will find out when it's on video when I watch it for free if I have a friend that even thinks it's worth purchasing. <br><br>That is Solo and IX will be the lowest grossing if you wisely stop production on Rian Johnson's announced trilogy. THOSE three will be the lowest grossing. Few people want to see a Rian Johnson trilogy. He is probably the most hated man in Star Wars now and I am blown away that there wasn't more done to insure that he maintained the continuity between The Force Awakens and this film and with the entirety of the Star Wars franchise. Kathleen Kennedy is now the most hated woman in Star Wars too and many people are blaming her poor leadership and political agenda for hurting the franchise in general and for ruining this film specifically. A lot of people are starting to feel like she betrayed George Lucas too and I am finding myself agreeing with that. You'll have to fire her and make a public display of cancelling Rian Johnson's trilogy if you want the fans to have faith in Star Wars again (actually now that I've written that out those two things might be enough for me to see the next Star Wars in the theaters if you were to follow through with them). <br><br>Or you can keep plucking feathers from that golden goose you slaughtered with this abomination of a film. It's your property now after all and I'm sure those feathers are worth... something.<br><br>You screwed up. George Lucas was stabbed in the back so you could get your hands on his multi-billion dollar franchise and then you made the EXACT same mistake he did with the prequels. You assumed people would love it as long as you slapped "Star Wars" on it so you didn't put a lot of effort into it. You should do some research into Gary Kurtz the producer of Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back and his contributions to those films as well as the ideas he discussed with Lucas about Return of the Jedi and the direction he saw the story going. He reeled in Lucas' sillier ideas he was instrumental in making Empire Strikes Back one of the greatest movie sequels of all time and I believe Lucas was wrong to cut ties with him.<br><br>It's pretty sad I had hoped that the Disney backing would lead to higher quality films with amazing sets and effects but you reached in and tore out the very heart of Star Wars while digging for gold. I liked Rogue One and saw it 4 times in the theater despite feeling like it was a little lacking. While it had some glaring flaws I liked The Force Awakens too. I saw it at least 3 times in the theater including opening night and the very first showing the next day. I saw The Last Jedi once and do not want to ever see it again on any format anywhere. The Last Jedi is so awful as a continuation of The Force Awaken's story it makes the flaws of that movie even more glaring to the point that it retroactively turns THAT movie into an awful movie as well. That is quite the feat of failure you have managed to accomplish Disney.<br><br>I really wanted to like the new trilogy but now it is not enjoyable to me at all.

 The story is very small in scope juxtaposed with a massive film budget. Rian Johnson turned the whole story into a simple and linear McGuffin chase scene. Beyond that the whole idea of the entire Republic being wiped out with just a few planets being destroyed is just lazy. Also lazy is the fact that this minor power (New Order) somehow magically makes and mans endless ships from the region of space that didn't have whole lot of humans and very limited trade (according to canon). All the while the main industrial centers of the Galaxy with well-established and large economies suddenly just collapse. Whether anyone realizes it or not this is a super lazy attempt to reboot the franchise while hoping no one notices. I noticed. <br><br>I appreciate the Joseph Campbell philosophy being applied here.

 This movie was a farce. The major theme of the movie was "Let the past die." - Kylo Ren. Well that is exactly what Rian Johnson did. He Killed the past's heroes as far as the Star Wars universe goes.<br>Abrams set him up with several mysteries to explore with Snoke with Rey's parents how did Maz end up with Luke's ESB light saber etc etc.<br>But Johnson thumbed his nose at Abrams Lucas and the fans who had high hopes for this movie that turned out to be nothing more than a PC-ified liberal agenda propaganda flick that assassinated the Star Wars legacy. I didn't feel like I was watching a Star Wars movie i felt as though I was watching a poorly conceived fan-fic chock full of wish fulfillment and Mary Sues abound while the heroes of the past 30 years are just swept away like they never mattered. A large portion of which were wiped out with a single line of dialogue. (all the male heroes of the resistance Admiral Ackbar etc etc).<br>The only reason I gave a full star is that there were a few great visual moments in the film. Too bad they weren't back up with substance. <br>As far as what made the movie bad there is just WAYYYYYY too much to list., 1.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977069452/, January 22 2018, 
 Biggest miss was the way Luke Skywalker's character has become a weak old man. For many of us he's is our hero and to see him go down this path was utterly disappointing. He's Luke Skywalker for pete's Sake! Other things that disappointed: Snoke dies before we ever learn more about him Leia flies through space like Superman Kylo destroys the coolest helmet ever eaerly in the film and we don't see it again Finn has no real purpose Poe has no purpose except at the beginning Leia's character is not given the ceremonial exit It Carrie Fisher deserved Rae's parents are junkies with no connection to anyone of significance even though Luke's lightsaber called to her and finally there is no cliffhanger., 1.0,  Ron M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976960761/, January 22 2018,

 SPOLIER ALERT: Don't read this if you haven't seen. I'm extremely disappointed in this installment of Star Wars as I've just seen it. There are so many things wrong with The Last Jedi and I completely blame the director as The Force Awakens was really really good. The acting (or rather direction) is terrible. Starting the movie with bad humor and jokes is very un-Star Wars like and it continued throughout the film. Luke's character is pathetically bad and some of the new characters should have been left out. Hopefully Disney has learned from it's mistake as they've asked JJ Abrams to direct episode 9 and I really wish he would've done episode 8 as well.

This movie is trash and should really be rated ZERO stars.** There were a few scenes I enjoyed but overall I felt frustrated throughout the entire movie. It did not feel like it belonged with the rest of the series and I feel does not live up to the Star Wars name. There's a reason people love Star Wars and this director decided to abandon those things and reinvent what Star Wars is. He is obviously underestimating the power of nostalgia.

 Like most I watched this film with hope (which is the point of the series) and my expectations slowly began to clip away. Parts that were meant to be funny came off as awkward or sad. Parts that were meant to be dramatic and moving made the entire audience laugh hysterically. Decades of lore were tossed aside and characters were permanently defamed for the sake of... I don't even know how to finish that sentence other than "marketing ploys and political agenda" This was not a failure it was a deliberate middle finger to the star wars audience. I would say that "I'll never see another Star Wars movie but the fans have made some impressive and moving films in the past and I'd rather the effects in a film suffer than the lore characters or logic itself like this movie has. This film is easily the worst in franchise history And yes I have seen the Ewok movies. Just like Resident Evil this is a franchise that will survive only in small indy or animated films among the fans. This film isn't meant for fans Its meant for children to enjoy the flashy effects buy the merchandise and soak up the idea of complete moral ambiguity that this soulless film has shown to promote.<br><br>Aside from Mary Poppins the effects looked great. I'm sorry to say that the musical score fell victim to the infernal noise of the dialogue and ADD-like location or tone transitions. This film might be fun to watch in 2x speed to some Benny Hill music but imagining it as part of the SW cannon is ridiculous. I could go into vivid detail about all the problems with this film but it looks like others have done a great job of that already. I am not a robot or a part of any political party If you love Star Wars or the history of it's characters please don't ever watch this film.

 The Last Jedi is not only the lamest Star Wars movie ever made it is simply a garbage movie. I persisted and gave this movie two Cinema viewings hoping my experience would somehow change but alas I was left bereft and bewildered at the poor and inconsistent plot failures to expand upon characters and storylines setup in the previous movie and the woeful attempts at slapstick humour.<br><br>Whilst production levels such as cinematography and sound engineering is very good in this movie these technical attributes can in no way make up for this movies inconsistent tone pacing issues and just plan poor story telling.<br><br>Lawrence Kasdan and JJ Abrams and associated creatives wrote and produced a far superior and thoughtful Star Wars film in the Force Awakens. Yes The Force Awakens with its reboot notions of a New Hope was peculiar...but the film was well crafted and positioned many potential plot lines and characters to be easily expanded upon in the next 2 films of this 40 year and a 9 film saga.<br><br>Such a shame and so very disappointing to see 40 years of cinema history treated this way., 1.0,  David H, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977069573/, January 23 2018,

 Undeserving of most backlash The Last Jedi ties together themes of failure regret and moving forward in a way that divided many fans of the series. Though I enjoyed it as a whole it is not a perfect movie. While Star Wars has always had moments of comic-relief in the films The Last Jedi often uses forced humor to its detriment (eg: the prank call the 4th or 5th use of the porgs etc). While I can appreciate The Last Jedi's aim to move beyond the shadow of previous Star Wars films often by taking turns or making choices that are not as predictable to the series it tends to over use this. While I don't mind the story cutting some elements common in the films to make way for the new I didn't appreciate the neglect for existing characters and relationships within the new trilogy (eg: Rey having great interactions with Luke and Kylo Ren but none at all with most of the rest of the cast from Ep. 7 including still barely saying more than a sentence to Poe). Overall a better experience than most fans claim but I believe it will be more appreciated with age., 4.0,  Chris L, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977069973/, January 23 2018, 
 I would like to add my voice to the chorus. By his own admission Rian Johnson knew this movie would be divisive. Why would anyone deliberately drive a wedge between members of a community? I keep hearing "Star Wars belongs to the world." I expand on my first question with another what gives Mr. Johnson the right to destroy something that doesn't belong to him? Johnson created nothing with this movie. Had he been chosen to write/direct The Force Awakens he would have been unable to. All he can do is step in afterward wreck everything that was set up and claim his "groundbreaking" movie "subverted expectations." That's nice aim below what people expect. Galadriel gave Gimli 3 hairs when asked for one. Had Gimli made the same request of Rian Johnson he would have poked Gimli in the eye and then acted offended when Gimli responded negatively. ??Additionally on the issue of poor writing good writers set up future scenes in movies or books. This is generally referred to as "Chekhov's gun." The long and short of it is the gun used to murder a character later on should be seen earlier. Johnson took plot points set up by JJ and threw away the pay off. This is not brilliant it is poor writing. Furthermore "pay off" scenes later in the movie had no set up. While it is true good writers can deftly navigate between subversion and proper set up Johnson in his infinite ignorance and lack of ability relied solely on subversion. It was his one tool. He was effective Disney has been subverted in their expectations at receiving more of my money., 1.0,  Joshua C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977069303/, January 23 2018,

 I truly do not understand how the Critics can be so positive about such a flawed Star Wars Movie. This movie is just plain terrible. All the male roles have been turned into paper puppets and the females are all but the greatest of the great with a do no wrong attitude.

 Having always loved the Star Wars franchise and after seeing the Force awakens and Rogue one i had pretty high hopes for this one and was looking forward to this movie. <br>But all ready at the first scene something was not right Poe calling Hux was a horrible cringe moment and from there it just got worse with the jokes they might work in the marvel universe but it does not work in Star Wars. <br>The horrible story arc of Finn and Rose which was a complete waste of time the Canto Bight scene all for the sake of watching a little kid force pull a broom in the end and at the moment when Finn actually have a good scene trying to stop the big Laser its ruined by Rose which then goes on to deliver the most cringy speech ever in a star wars movie. Now comes the question how did they not get shot to piece by the walkers as they crashed very close to them ..?? horrible writing.<br>The story Arc of Luke is also very disappointing I wont even go into detail but it is just awfull. <br>The story of Kylo is that he still a whiny EMO which is on purpose to make Rey look better and here comes the Kathleen Kennedy influence. <br>Rey is just Meeeehh there is no reason to relate to her because its obvious that she is female version of Luke but much more bland and no depth. <br>And ooohhh the plot holes here we go. <br>Why didn't Holdo just tell Poe what the plan was..?? <br>Why would Luke try to kill his Nephew because he saw some darkness in him considering how he would not stop to try and turn a much more evil being that he barely knew..??<br>How could Snoke escape Darth Sidious and Darth Vader clearly he was strong in the force and had experienced the rise and fall of the empire which means the 2 sith lords should have sensed him where did his dark side training come from..??<br>Where are the knights of Ren..??<br>Why didn't the resistance not just use the 2 fregats that ran out of fuel as weapons like Holdo did with the last cruiser..?? <br>There are many many more points that makes this movie so disappointing but I will end here.<br>Overall it was such an disappointment to watch., 1.0,  Bo J, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977039925/, January 23 2018,

Most main plots in the film are really unstable and could be easliy evaded or ended but seems to be drawn out for cinematic effect., 0.5,  chris%20 s, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977069230/, January 22 2018, 
 Worst star wars to date. Didn't like the prequels but hate the last jedi, ,  Anders J, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977069220/, January 22 2018, 
 Good looking movie with great actors and music. <br><br>But sorely lacking in pacing and writing while having a bit of an identity crisis. <br><br>This did not feel like a great space fantasy adventure taking place in the star wars universe.<br><br>honestly i feel like the critics here either didn't really watch the movie properly or they got paid by Disney. If normal users can cheat why wouldn't companies??, 3.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976654428/, January 22 2018, 
 Updating my review to 1 star. I see people commenting that a 1/2 star or a review of " not interested " is not accepted / included into the RT score system.<br><br>If you posted a review of 1/2 star or " not interested " In hopes of affecting the score you might want to revise it to 1 star. it is still negative but at least for sure your vote...I think...will be accumulated.<br><br>I fear this must be the case...as unless this is a new math that I can not seem to understand.... the overall majority of reviews are in the negative. The current 49% seems inflated. <br><br>It is not only " fanboys" as people call us that did not like the movie it is men women teens people of all ethnicitys.Doctors lawyers professionals.... educated inteligent people. So I find it almost funny that Kathleen K Ryan J...give the impression anyone not liking this movie is a racist a sexist pig or a retard.<br><br>Way beyond insulting<br><br><br>Anyway... my review...<br><br><br>All you 5 star review people saying " Best movie ever ! " or similar....How can you give this movie top marks with all the errors and the destruction of all the previous movies ? You must be seeing a different movie than the rest of us because honestly I do not understand how any one can give it more than maybe 2 stars for visuals and music.<br><br>What did you see that made you feel it earns 5 stars?<br><br>This is a horrible movie terrible writting total disregard for past movie lore and the basic history of Star Wars.<br><br>I have a theory now as to why we have not seen the Han Solo trailer as of yet as has been speculated and hinted at that we would see it before now. Is that Disney / Kathleen Kennedy maybe is a little worried with their social warrior bullshit. I think they know if they fuck up Han Solo...change his character...as they did to Luke..this wil be the end. no more billion dollar paydays for the movies. <br><br>Anyway The last jedi.<br>It is shit pure and simple with horrid writting and full of nonsensical plots and errors.<br><br>Here is a quote from another person on here I agree 100% with everything listed.<br><br>Quote.<br>How any thinking person can give this movie 4 or 5 stars is beyond me. If you do not think and do not care if a movie has any connection to its past...I guess this is for you and ok more power to you. But when I go to see a movie in a trillogy I like to see it connect at least in part to some of its history.<br><br>This movie does not it is horrible story telling and removes much of what was previous for no reason.<br><br>This movie does not answer any questions from TFA  and the few it does were lack luster. <br><br>The story...such as it is is nonsensical written terribly and is full of so many errors that it makes watching it difficult. <br><br><br>Some glaring things/ errors I found that insulted my inteligence or tossed out old star wars lore.<br><br>1) C3P0... from TFA to TLJ the timeline is only a few days maybe a week from the destruction of the First order star killer base. The resistance / rebelion is under sige... but in all this chaos someone decided to find C3P0 a new matching arm ? ( arm was red in TFA ) This was more important than...I dont know....? suriving the battles with the first order ? " Oh my god were going to die ! But...wait ! C3P0 !....I know your left arm is ok and it functions... but I cant stand the color....go down to maintence and get a new one to match your other arm! " Is this what has happened amidst all the chaos ??<br><br>This is what constitutes good writing ? Lack of attention to details and poor story continuation. This is part 8 yes? It is a continuation of part 7....yes or maybe I am the one in error?? Glaring errors.<br><br>*** How can anyone say this is a 5 star movie ? How can critics not see any of these errors ? is it not important? <br><br>2) As has been noted the humor was stupid Hux and Poe the telephone call was idiotic and after that you could not take any of the first order officers as serious characters. Humor in bad moments when the flight deck is destroyed and all the resistance pilots are killed... save for Poe... Instead of having a moment of grief for the audience.. BB8 bounces in with the stupid beeping " Dont worry kids ! I am okay ! See I am alive....everyone else is dead BUT!!! Me the cute robot ! I lived ! Dont feel bad for the other people.... I am still here ! " This was so stupid. In rogue one and looking back on A new Hope...when pilots / people were killed the audience could feel something for the lost characters.... but in this trash its like all these people were in the way and good ridance...But wow ! Thank god the annoying droid is alive... I was really worrioed..... <br><br>Shit writing shit humor.<br><br><br>3) The timeline for TLJ is only a few days from when the resistance destroyed the first order star killer base from TFA..... in that time the resistance has become a shadow of its former self no support no money no people no ships....nada. They have been fighting for 40 years saved the galaxy from Darth Vader the Emperor they destroyed 2 death stars and the first order planet killer ....and have no support from the galaxy of people they have been saving " oh yeah thanks for keeping my planet from being blown up... money ? ...support?? ... yeah...well you know times are tough..sorry cant help you... " At the end of the movie...the resistance now..less 400 people no ships no nada...and to hide behind a big metal door the great plan was to send out a message begging for help....seriously ?! If no one wanted to help the resistance at its best no one would be coming when they are at their worst.<br><br>Just 100% shit writing lazy writing.<br><br>4) Rose and Fin. Underdevoped characters brought in ..it seems for comic relief. Casino planet was a complete waste of time. Chewie and R2D2...wow...iconic characters with almost no screen time. <br><br>5) The force now....teaches you everthing you need to know ! Training ??! Who the fuck needs training ?! Not Rey ! She knows everything including how to best a jedi master ! And certainly not the kid at the end of the movie moving his broom in ways that took Aniken years to master ! Is this the message we want to send out ? " You dont need school or training or experience.... you should know everything all on your own" WTF do we all spend money to go to university for ? No start at the bottom and work your way to the top you should be entitled to be president of a company the moment you apply for a job..... For fuck sake<br><br>Anyway...<br><br>Lazy shit writing that in mere moments destroys all the old lore for the past movies.<br><br>6) Luke...the man that can find good in Darth Vader spare his life... now at a moment of weakness....is going to kill his nephew his sisters and his best friends son...Because !!! He has dark thoughts...?! Seriously ?! Did the idiot writer not read a book or see any of the previous movies ? What ?! This is good writing ? This is good character developement ? This is ...new and fresh captivating ? This exciting changes to the characters ?! And Lukes map ?...okay...why did he leave a map if he had no desire to be found?? ! It is beyond stupid. <br><br><br>***You people giving 5 stars....did you not notice any of this ? Or you just could not give a shit ??*** <br><br><br>7) Leia..okay...wow just wow........never using the force for anything cant use the force to find Luke....But in one moment when she is sucked into the vacume of space she can become the most powerful jedi or sith that has ever lived before or since?! Wow... more shit writing just for have a extra movie subplot? Or what?<br><br><br>8) Reys parentage... ok we had to wait 2 years for the big back story of " sorry your parents were dead beat drunks " Ok and fine but this could have been built up much different.<br><br>Lazy writing<br><br>9) Snoke.... dont know where he came from how he took over power who trained him...nada. There is no mention of his name in any of the previous movies books cartoons nothing. A character with no backstory killed off.<br><br>10 The big space chase. The first order... they are so stupid...as to not send ships out in front to blockade the resistance ? It was impossible to think of the first order with any degree of seriousness<br><br>11) Yoda now is almost a god. He can command lighting to destroy things. Where the fuck was he if he was so powerful to give Luke some tutoring when he was teaching his students?' Where was Obi Wan ? They let him fuck up with his students and basicaly from that mistake the first order rises up.... and ..they leave Luke to be depressed for his depression on the island...? But ! Yoda decides to come out of ...hiding ? And tell Luke the old jedi books are no longer important and uses the force to burn the old books ? Seriously ?<br><br>This is good writing? this is entertaining ? Again you 5 star review people...did none of this make you think " WTF ?"<br><br>12) The Knights of Ren are....where ? Anyone know ?<br><br>Maybe the 5 star review people know? I know I dont have a clue but for many people this did not seem important. <br><br>13) Kylo Ren and Fin at the end of TFA are both very injured now a few days later in TLJ... they are ok ? Kylo was cut down hard and Fin was almost dead...? <br><br>( 5 star review people care to comment on this ?? ) <br><br>14) Sub plots with no point misplaced humor no character development or very poor use of characters and actors. Captain Phasma..and Benicio Del Toro...what a waste.<br><br>15) Social messages...... we need this in a star wars movie ? Men are evil or stupid or both. Rich people are all bad and cant be trusted...? This last part I find almost funny coming from people like Kathleen Kennedy and the Disney executives...These people make more money in 1 week than most people will see in 5 lifetimes... but obviosly they do not consider themselves as rich / wealthy ....?<br><br>16) Why did a droid not pilot the ship in its suicide run ? Or...autopilot ? Droids have more value than a living being ? Or ...was purple hair commander not able to think about this ? We needed one more heroic death ?<br><br>17) Admiral Akbar....after 40 + years service to the rebelion...his character is quite literal tossed out the window.... not even a " Thanks much ! " Again what a horrible send off to a loved character.<br><br>The story the writting the plot seriously think about it...it is horrible. How anyone can see this movie...even as a stand alone movie...not as a star wars movie and give it a 5 star review blows my mind.<br><br>" Let the past die...kill it if you must " <br>Yup ! Similar to Akbar...I think this is what Disney intentions are for the 40 years of fans of the movies . " We dont need or want you any more...fuck off ! "<br><br><br>I can go one and on and on as to why this movie is so terrible just as so many other people have. it is a shit movie on its own it is a shit movie as a star wars movie it is a disgrace.<br><br>Honestly...I think Disney and Kathleen Kennedy must think . <br>" All the star wars fans are stupid and they will buy into anything we want and will not notice any changes. They are to stupid to know or care what we do with the movies they will go and pay the money and not care because !! Its Star wars !"<br><br>I give 1 star for good visuals and music but the rest of the movie is trash.<br><br>End quote.<br><br>I give 1 star for visuals and music.... but honestly this should be a given for a Star Wars movie..., 1.0,  Carter R, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977031684/, January 22 2018, 
 As a lifelong fan of all star wars films this one disappointed me. It is not the worst of the star wars films (Attack of the Clones holds that record) but the story seemed to lack expansion like all the other Star Wars films. The entire story really being confined to one ship with a few scenes switching between some new planets did not feel right. Also Carrie Fishers scene floating in space was one of the worst scenes I have ever seen in Star Wars film. But I loved the character development in this film I thought some heavy focus on Poe was much needed for fans and even some clarity and development on Kylo and Rey's relationship. This felt like more of a filler movie than an addition to Star Wars and this is leading up to something massive. So I have a New Hope (pun intended) for episode 9., 3.0,  Matthew P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977061280/, January 22 2018,

 If Kylo Ren characterization at the "Force Awakens" was weak it is sad to see the same low performance at the "Last Jedi" portraiting a childish attitude of what should be a lot more intelligent and profound one. The movie left me with a sence of being also "very low budget". The Director does not take any advantage on Daisy Ridley's strong personallity for which I was expecting a lot: Rey is oddly portraited and so passive - no emotions whatsoever. It is hard to see if the next movie will be anything close to "good" now that all the good actors and emotionally strong characters are gone., 0.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977042456/, January 22 2018, 
 Bad plot is now 'surprising twists' and social justice is now 'emotion-rich'. This is NOT what fans were hoping for.

The correct 'score' lies probably in between at 70%., 0.5,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977069073/, January 22 2018,

 Carrie Fisher's best performance as Leia. That alone is worth it. But without spoiling anything the story which may be controversial to some worked for me. Everyone put in a brilliant acting performance. The movie was visually stunning as well. Not just the typical "giant yet minutely detailed ships" but the whole thing is cinematically beautiful. I loved it though if you were an admirer of Carrie Fisher the real life human as well as the iconic character she played bring some tissues.

 A poor script and bad direction lead us into a land of plotholes you can drive Death Stars through and incompetent casting and direction decisions. It's overly long is inspired by a third-rate directors belief that he needs to live up to Vince Gilligan's "torture your darlings" aesthetic with none of Vince Gilligan's skill (bonus points he actually cost Breaking Bad a significant part of it's audience as he presided over the most controversial and least necessary episode of the show).<br><br>The premise is admitted in dialogue as false (a tale chase with the faster ships losing is literally impossible) it relies on an unobtanium McGuffin to retain tension it eliminates 90% of the supporting cast of Return of the Jedi to an unknown mook opponent in a single second for a reward which couldn't and forever after cant be realized.<br><br>This is probably Rian Johnson's best work.

 This film is passable but that's it. Far to often during the course of the film i found myself saying "How?!" or "Why?!" or even "Why didn't you do that 5 minutes ago?!" Beyond that the film seems to go out of it's way to deliberately ignore or shrug off questions and implications brought up by The Force Awakens to the point where the film feels almost insulting to the viewer for wanting answers to those questions. The film even not-so-subtly makes fun of other Star Wars films while still trying to BE a Star Wars film and the overall effect the viewer is left with is that the writers weren't taking the job seriously. Mind the effects are great and the battle sequences are amazing and I applaud the writers for trying to take things in a more realistic direction such as Poe getting chewed out and demoted for being a cocky flyboy and causing trouble but the way they went about it felt a little too insulting towards the earlier movies where plans and actions similar to his are openly praised. All in all this film seems to try too hard not to be a Star Wars film while still being a Star Wars film., 2.0,  , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976813900/, January 22 2018,

 Rather underwhelming Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a solid sci-fi adventure but it fails to build on the promise of Force Awakens. After a costly attack on a First Order armada the Resistance is depleted of resources and retreats to a fortified moon base for a last stand meanwhile Ray pleads with a reluctant Luke Skywalker to train her to be a Jedi. None of the mysteries set up in the last film are followed through with or get satisfactory answers Ray's parentage Snoke's possible Jedi/Sith connect Luke's battle with the Knights of Ren etc. The script is poorly written and the characters don't feel the same. In fact the directing and editing are so different that the film doesn't even feel connect to the previous ones. Still most of the action scenes are exciting and the lightsaber fights are intense and dramatic. And the special effects are especially well-done making for some visually compelling set and character designs. While Star Wars: The Last Jedi does''t live up to the standard that's been set by the new Star Wars films it's entertaining and moves the saga forward (though not by much)., 3.5, , https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/906395584/, January 22 2018, yle="color:#3A9425"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span> Super R
 (UPDATED: Again another one of those who changed the review from 1/2 star to 1 full star though this film is not worth even 1/2 star. Doing this in order to ensure my review is counted as ROTTEN by rotten tomatoes). <br><br>"Everything this movie said.... was wrong". I have been a fan of this series since I was 8 years old I have watched every movie multiple times and though I found the prequels to be lacking and silly I have watched them more than a few times. The prequels were certainly a let down but never have I been so disappointed in a Star Wars movie than this one. <br><br>The film makers literally shoved their middle finger in my face and said :"Everything you know about Star Wars your hero Skywalker the hero's journey the lore the history is all BS". THE 49% audience score as of this writing is way too high I am utterly gobsmacked it is this high.<br><br>It is truly disgusting what this film has done to the franchise and the number of fans that will exit in the franchise will be in enormous. I have no interest in seeing IX or any other Kathleen Kennedy produced Star Wars film period. <br><br>What went wrong.<br><br>1. A plot that was neither interesting or compelling one that was so full of holes it was like a prepubescent teen wrote the script. Many if not most of the people who 'loved' this movie (as hard as that is to believe) often cite it is "new fresh different than what we have seen before". O'really? Lets see about this. (*Spoilers*) The movie opens with the First Order attacking the Resistance base and the resistance fighters narrowly escaping (hmmmmm where have see seen that before) after the escape a chase ensues (hmmmmm where have we seen that before except in Empire Strikes Back it was much more exciting) meanwhile our protagonist travels a great distance to find a Jedi master (hmmmmm where have see seen that before) our protagonist gets some teachings from the Jedi master (hmmmmmm where have we seen that before except in TLJ she gets three lessons which actually turn into two lessons just after breakfast one was why the Jedi should die and the other was about breathing then abruptly ended) our protagonist then declares the antagonist still has good inside them and rushes off to turn them to the light side (hmmmmm where have we seen that before) when she gets there she is brought before his master (hmmmm where have we seen that before) our antagonist tempts our protagonist to join him (hmmmmm where have we seen that before) the antagonist kills his mentor (hmmmm where have we seen that before). THERE IS NOTHING NEW here it is a rehash of prior plot elements assembled into an incoherent worthless plot line that takes a royal S**T on everything that is Star Wars. <br><br>2. Total character assassination (Skywalker) and lack of major character development of the new 'crew' introduced in the Force Awakens not to mention dimensionless new characters that add nothing to the story and bring back painful memory of Jar Jar Binks (Rose). <br><br>3. Continuity problems abound with respect to FA. Either plot lines were ignored or the were brushed aside like the were meaningless yes this idiot Rian Johnson has managed to not only make the worst Star Wars movie to date but he managed to make the preceding movie worse than it was while at the same time elevating the prequels to a new status of "goodness" relatively speaking -- that takes a very special ineptness of talent. <br><br>4. What is up with the horrid humor it is like every other scene there is some tension destroying joke that falls flat and adds no meaning to the story WTF. In the original trilogy there was some humor very little but some and when it was used it was witty and well placed not forced and flat and frankly majorly stupid.<br><br>5. Leia Poppins' - see the countless comments on how massively stupid that turned out. <br><br>6. Luke sucking bluish green milk from the teat of a lactating sea monster ... come on. <br><br>7. Unbounded magic -- in many plot points of this pile of trash new force powers are invented out of thin air no precedent nothing in cannon to support this. For example force spirits calling lightning bolts. Or new tactics in combat such as to weaponize hyper-drive/hyper-space. Doing so automatically binds the next film in terms of 'the rules' and ruins previous films by opening enormous plot holes. This simply exudes how poor the writing was and how much contempt the writer had for Star Wars history and legend. Inventing new powers for the sake of new powers just to fit a contrived plot in once instance while ignoring all other established world building fact is simply bad writing.<br><br>This movie was thoroughly disgusting from the first frame to the last. It stinks that RT does not allow negative stars this is by far and away the worst movie I have ever seen.

 The Last Jedi provided zero cliff-hangers. The movie is an extension of the Force Awakens with the same internal conflicts between Rey and Kylo both.

 This film is utter garbage manure to be recycled and throw out without a second thought. The plot is horrible and doesn't follow the slightest logic from the previous episode. <br>Nothing makes any sense whatsoever and the identity of the characters introduced in the previous film is not only not revealed as promised but completely ludicrous.<br>To make things worst this is an SJW piece of trash with feminists and women being all the good character and white males being all the bad guys. It is female supremacist sexism at its worst. <br>Lastly by far the worst and most idiotic scene in the film was the flying space Leia Mary Poppins scene when she is left for dead in the vacuum of space where anything dies and then she pulls herself as on a space elevator force pulls the door open and lets herself back into the ship without the air being sucked out in the vacuum of space. <br><br>Completely idiotic plot terrible acting and less than credible characters especially the Mary Sue Rey who receives no training in anything and yet is a perfect mechanic perfect shot perfect light saber duelist and perfect force wielder., 1.0,  ace k, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977068647/, January 22 2018, 
 This movie was barely watchable let alone something that furthered the story line of any character other than Kylo Ren.

 Weird INTERESTING nuanced. Could've used some serious help with the screenplay. Not a fan of the prequel-style slapstick humour or the irrelevant subplots but the bones here are great and the main stuff is done right (at least in my opinion). Rey and Kylo stuff is great. Luke and Leia stuff is brilliant. Overall there are too many characters who don't add to Rey's journey. Good film mediocre 2nd film in a trilogy.

 Welcome to Star Wars Pussy-Whipped Leftist All-Minorities-Included Edition.<br>I have read in the news that some angry Star Wars fan published an edited version of The Last Jedi without all the unnecessary feminazi social justice warrior vegan diversity-at-all-costs nonsense... and all that remains are 40 minutes of nothing.<br>I also had the same instinct to try to save the movie by editing out the nonsense. This guy saved me time and effort. Neither of them is worth the trying. We have to admit that this movie is fucked beyond any repair.<br>The leftist turn had already been slapped in our face through the red-dominated posters which by themselves were a complete digression from the look and feel of the Star Wars franchise. The movie confirmed that it was at no point the intention of Rian Johnson to make a good Star Wars Movie. His intention was and he may admit it publicly sooner or later to shove in our throats tons and tons of barely concealed anti-male female-supremacy anti-western-civilization pro-diversity-at-all-costs leftist anti-capitalist animalist vegan propaganda.<br>One may think that he spent 99% of his time trying to conceive a way to shove all this propaganda up our asses and only 1% of the time trying to write a decent script.<br>The result is a movie which has been correctly described as a catastrophe a travesty a piece of the worst kind of agit-prop propaganda.<br>Beyond that on a strict cinematographic plane it is full of plot holes bad jokes thrown in our faces for the sake of themselves unrealistic twists and subplots that add nothing to the story.<br>And it does not a good service to the causes Rian Johnson so desperately wanted to push: the actions of the two women admiral Purple Lesbo and poor-fat-ugly-stupid-self-appointed-minority-social-animal-rights-warrior Rose were so misconceived that they put at serious risk the lives of the rebels (Rose stopping Finn from destroying the cannon thus giving the First Order the possibility to wipe off the rebels) or worse they caused thousands of deaths (admiral Holdo not telling anyone her plans and subsequently hesitating way too much before finally warp-ramming Snooke's starship).<br>Freeing the animals (and not freeing the slave children!) only to have them most probably recaptured the day after by the rich-and-therefore-bad people of Canto Bight is not only useless. It is plainly stupid.<br>Is Rian Johnson a double agent of the worst right-wing white-male-supremacists? If so he did an extremely good job.

 1 Star for visuals everything else is a disappointment. By far the worst Star Wars film to date can't believe everything from The Force Awakens (which I actually enjoyed) gets thrown out the window completely for the sake of "Let the past die" just a stupid reason to cover up bad story telling. So many wasted opportunities and characters what was the point in Captain Phasma and Snoke? absolutely no point at all.

 Angry fans are so wrong. I have been a Star Wars lover for 40 years now. Thanks to Rian Johnson I felt like I was 7 again.<br>The action the twists! What an entertainment! The film is very dense and extremely smart. You have to watch it again and again to understand how much Rian Jonhson has weighed every decision he made with the story. The characters finally become interesting deep and true (Rian Johnson obviously leads the actors better than JJ Abrams for whom I have the greatest respect though).<br>The beauty of certain scenes including the heroic gesture of Holdo and the Battle of Crait by far exceeds anything we have seen in the previous episodes.<br>Can't wait for the DVD well iTunes actually., 5.0,  Fabrice F, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977039246/, January 23 2018,

 I as many others have also signed up just to leave this review. As an early twenties human I grew up with the prequels being my first exposure to Star Wars. While I hated Jar Jar and thought there were some really corny moments I fell in love with the ability to imagine that there was another galaxy like this possibly out there. <br>I went and saw this movie right when it was released and my friends and I walked out of the cinema angry and confused. What did I just watch? The only thing that kept me from walking out of the cinema halfway through was my sense that I at least owe it to the Franchise to see it through.<br>While people had differing opinions on the originals and the prequels the films had a set of rules/laws that helped create a sense of realism. The Last Jedi just shits on that sense with it's major plot holes pointless sub plots and direction. I left the cinema asking myself what happened? How does space work now? Why didn't anyone weaponise hyperspace travel before? What was the point in all the prior movies' storylines if they just dismissed it all? Even The Force Awakens - destroying the starkiller base did absolutely nothing but set up a place for Han to die. How are fans meant to feel? How am I meant to feel? It's been over a month since seeing it and after reading reviews and analyses for both sides I have not found anything to convince me The Last Jedi is a good film. 91% critics score to a 49% audience score? Has that ever happened before? Does this suggest critics are bought out? Am I overthinking? <br>Don't get me wrong though I thought The Last Jedi had some amazing moments (hyperspace through the dreadnought Kylo and Rey teaming up!) And great ideas. I just think they were executed poorly. Random Asian Female kicks a big ladder to knock the detonator off down to her to release bombs in space where gravity is not a factor all while being in the lower section of the bomber that has been compromised and exposed to space itself? What? Superman Leia? What? The Casino planet stab at wealthy greedy people where our "heroes" would rather free the abused animals over the actual children forced into slavery????????? What?! How can I cheer on this new Finn and randomly inserted obligatory diversity quota character of Rose if they were willing to sacrifice and fail their mission just to save animals - especially over children?????? If I were one of those children I'd be like "wtf Resistance?"<br>The only character I care about now is Kylo Ben Swolo Ren because he actually has character development. <br>I don't care about Rey. She is a Mary Sue. She is good at everything and loved by everyone. Defeated both Kylo and Luke with no training. Never succumbs to the Dark Side. Is selfless in her actions to help anyone in need. No flaws whatsoever except for maybe being too trusting? <br>I do appreciate introducing me to Daisy Ridley however - new celeb crush!<br>I thought it absolutely awesome that they made a female main hero character - Rey could have been an amazing role model. But with her flawless traits and obscured story she is almost unrelatable and unrealistically achievable.<br><br>And surely you can't tell me with a straight face that Kathleen Kennedy is not pushing a feminist empowerment agenda through Star Wars. She blatantly punches you in the face with it! Degrades our current Resistance Male heroes The First Order are all men except Phasma Admiral Gender Studies not sharing the plan allows women to sacrifice themselves but when Finn tries to Rose somehow catches up intercepts him and tells him war is saving those you love... yeah okay tell that to all our military veterans and current serving members. Oh wait in Australia right now the Defence Force are only accepting Female applicants. So she might be right...<br>Women have had a number of great female characters to look up to in the past films and TV series. You don't have to try create new idols by targeted digs at common male insecurities. <br><br>I think about the possibility that I'm older and Children now will see and enjoy Star Wars like how I did with the prequels. I can now honestly and sincerely say that I will never watch a future Star Wars film in cinemas. Shat on my childhood. Get the f*** outta here with this bull**** Ruin Johnson., ni,  Weezus T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977068026/, January 23 2018, 
 !!SPOILER ALERT!!<br><br>I am a true Star Wars fan and an open minded one at that. That means even though the prequels were somewhat of a disappointment I can appreciate theme none the less. They serve a purpose. I can say that the latest trilogy does.<br><br>I was so excited for the Force Awakens an like 90% of other Star Wars fans left the cinema thinking I'd just watched A New Hope. For two years I waited with anticipation for the next instalment of the Saga. Leading up to it I hear Ryan Johnson has been given his own Trilogy. How could The Last Jedi be a disappointment if Lucasfilm and Disney are willing to trust its writer and director with something like that?<br><br>So I let the hype die down even though I do like a good atmosphere in the cinema I don't like it too packed.<br><br>The film starts the text scrolls and I can actually feel Goosebumps I AM SO EXCITED.<br><br>So we have out epic space battle required of every Star Wars movie fine. This is followed by the resistance or is it the rebellion (this film doesn't seem to know what its called) jump to light speed only to be tracked through hyperspace and caught up with by the first order. Leia astounded says "They tracked us through hyperspace" of course that's something that must be unheard of? (Cast you mind back to the end of Rogue One and the beginning of A New Hope.) Taintive 5 pursued by the evil Darth Vader on his Star Destroyer moments after it jumped to light speed fleeing the battle over Scarif.<br><br>The main plot follows out Heroes trying to outrun the First Order before they run out of fuel apparently inertia isn't a thing in space!<br><br>Then we have a side mission for Finn and new box ticker Rose who go off to Casino land in search of a code breaker so the tracker which apparently is only installed on a single star destroyer can be turned off only to fail their mission and watch as their fleet of escape pods is destroyer ONE BY ONE.<br><br>Meanwhile also failing their mission is Rey who is trying to get the now hermit Luke Skywalker to re-join the rebellion.

 Rotten Tomatoes has completely frozen the audience review score. It's mathematically impossible to remain at 49%. The average should be in the 30's at this point. This site has proven to be a complete joke and has exposed itself as the scam it really is. THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE. No amount of "positive" media coverage or bought off critics can change this fact. TLJ is an abomination to Star Wars and may have irreparably destroyed the franchise.

 The trailers for this one really led us on. I thought the film would be an interesting and engaging delve into the slightly greyer areas of the force a darker turn after the rather fluffy re-introductory Force Awakens of 2 years ago. It really seemed like something philosophically interesting was going to be built upon with Luke's asserting the need for an end to the force Rey clearly tempted by Kylo Ren Kylo Ren evidently not nearly as committed to the First Order as Hux/Snoke. So much potential so much wastage. <br><br>Some of these themes were indeed touched upon and in my opinion formed the backbone of the salvageably coherent storytelling. Luke did have his issues with the force but everything we know about him was trashed in the process (from Darth Vader's saviour to a bearded sea walrus-milking antisocial hermit with some lame one-liners. A man who claims not to want to be found despite leaving a map to where you could find him!! (clearly Rian didn't bother to think that one through)). Rey toyed with the dark side though it was unclear exactly how given how little training she actually receives or what purpose the cave scene served. Kylo does also betray the First Order but these decisions are ultimately inconsequential as he immediately doubles down on his efforts to destroy the resistance after Rey departs and his mother is miraculously resurrected in goddess-like fashion anyway (don't get me started). As in the Force Awakens after Death Star 2.0 is destroyed and we pick up the action in TLJ with that apparently not having been an issue for the First Order some of the major plot points seem to have no consequence or impact. It makes them difficult to believe let alone care about. <br><br>The above for me were the most engaging elements of the story though deeply flawed in execution and I think would make a cracking film if fully developed and explored in a coherent manner that actually tied them down across the 3 films.<br><br>Aside from that there were too many distractions.<br><br>Our protagonist suffers the inconsequentiality problem too being too accomplished too talented too beautiful and too boring to care about. The stakes just aren't high enough and there is no character development to track and see unfold. And then we find out she has no history either thanks for nothing! I can see how some fans might cheer this writing choice for being daring but in the world of complex universe building it is hardly logical to hint at a potentially momentous revelation about the key character throughout an entire film only to have it come to nothing. This is made especially fraught when the decision feels influenced at least in part by contemporary political motivations. Politics before plot? Bad choice. More on that below.<br><br>General Hux and the First Order are too incompetent to fear all this Weasley brother does is scream incoherently while his partner in crime Emo Ren sulks and throws tantrums. Although I do admire their performances (they've done as directed) they're just not valid villains. Captain Phasma isn't even present and we're supposed to fear her. And Snoke! Why build the guy up if we're not going to see him do anything of consequence? He's clearly an extremely powerful Sith surely a final boss but is left emasculated and wasted before he has any real chance to lay out his vision. <br><br>The entire side-plot is a nonsense leading to nowhere signifying nothing. Rose is too perfect showcasing her immaculate politics and making excessively gooey statements at inappropriate moments (starving Fin of a noble and natural conclusion to his arc and imperilling every one of her remaining rebel friends at the same time). There are just too many plot holes in this sub-plot to mention the entire thing was more distraction than story for me. To cite a few how on Earth does Rose revere Finn as this legend of the resistance with him having only just finished blowing up the Death Star 2.0? Their forced romance also feels gratuitous I just don't know why its even there. Why does the director feel the need to feed us 'save the panda' propaganda? Especially in a context in which they'll only be recaptured the following morning and there are CHILD SLAVES who could be incorporated into the plot and rescued instead! <br><br>The anti-capitalist anti-slave labour pro-animal rights anti-weapons manufacturing anti-gambling and pro-wealth redistribution messaging was way too overt. Rose makes direct reference to her already overplayed 'downtrodden-but-determined' stereotype by elaborating on her already pointless story with an even more pointless backstory touching on these very themes almost directly to camera! <br><br>Weaponising light speed is lazy and breaks the internal consistency of the Star Wars universe. <br><br>The main plot point this exceptionally technologically advanced spaceship slowly running out of fuel and coming to a halt is completely implausible in Star Wars (of course implausible things happen in this fictional universe but the writers must at least APPEAR to want to build a world that respects some form of scientific logic or at least think about it). Why didn't they just hyperspace a few miles further to reach their new base? Why didn't the First Order send out some other ships and encircle them? Why didn't they just put a thai fighter on auto-pilot and crash it into them at light speed for that matter?! It felt silly to me a forced contrivance from a writer bereft of good ideas who needed to fill a couple of hours' worth of Star Wars cannon.<br><br>Admiral Ackbar is killed with no ceremony whatsoever. <br><br>Who the heck is this new Vice Admiral we've never seen before and who Poe isn't even aware exists despite him being a fairly high ranking member of this relatively small resistance group? And why doesn't the position go to Admiral Ackbar (personal choice)? Thirty year's of solid service and no promotion! (OK he's dead at the time but should be kept alive for it!)<br><br>Why did Vice Admiral Holdo keep her plan a secret? <br><br>Was it me or was Rian hinting at closer-than-usual friendship between Leia and Holdo ? Surely unnecessary if so.<br><br>Too many silly jokes prolonged for too long. Yoda insulting the sacred Jedi texts by saying they're not page turners Rey asking Kylo to put his shirt on and Poe trolling General Hux like Bart Simpson prank-calling Bartender Mo ... dear God.<br><br>Luke throwing away the lightsaber! Cheap and gimmicky. Not necessarily an issue if built upon capably but it wasn't. This being the main cliff-hanger of the film before made this even more egregious. <br><br>Rian Johnson really should not have adopted the central theme of his film into his writing approach. The 'kill the past' narrative just felt to me like him trying to excuse his unwillingness or inability to write a coherent story that fits into the wider cannon effectively or even respects the major plot points developed in the prior film. He themes were a coded way of asking us for forgiveness or better to preemptively ward off the criticism he maybe knew was coming.<br><br>On the positive side (yes there is one) I thought the music was solid (though not spectacular) the actors put in decent performances (particular kudos to Mark Hamill and Adam Driver I think on those counts) and the visuals were stunning. <br><br>So on a technical and professional level I really have few gripes. On an artistic and thematic one however way off. And this is almost entirely the fault of the Rian Johnson., 1.0,  Ryan E, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977068238/, January 22 2018,

 I created an account just so I can rate this movie. Never have I felt so strongly about a movie before that I had the need to post a review. I cannot believe the horrific choices that were made in this film. If you were a fan of the original three films I would make sure to never see this film as I wish I could scour it from my memory. The way that the character of Luke is treated is downright criminal. It is without a doubt in my mind the dumbest main story plot I have seen for a Star Wars movie. Not only was the plot stupid but there was no logic used in the creation and execution of the storyline. By the end of the film you are left to wonder where they could possibly go for the next film but more importantly you could care less.<br>Disney has destroyed Star Wars and I will no longer be partaking in any Star Wars movies or merchandise. Needed to write this review just to put closure on this and warn away anyone who truly loves the original trilogy and Luke Skywalker. Wish I had driven to the theater myself instead of riding with my friends as I would have walked out of the theater and saved myself from at least an extra hour and a half of pain.

 I have been a fan of Star Wars my whole life (I'm 42 years old). I tolerated the prequels and still watch them every now and then. I was excited about Star Wars "The Force Awakens" and looked forward to see the future of my favorite franchise. BUT what Disney has done in this latest film is completely awful and can never be taken back. Why in hell would they ruin the original characters of this franchise.

 The Last Jedi certainly heard the criticism of the Force Awakens and took a risk. Whether the risk paid off is something that will not be settled until the trilogy concludes possibly ever. But personally I would like to salute director and writer Rian Johnson for taking that risk. The new and darker Luke Skywalker takes some getting used to but I was a huge fan. It really adds layers to a character we thought we knew so well. The much anticipated reveal of Rey's parents was without controversy but personally I thought it was the best fit for the plot. The reboot of the franchise has done a great job with the casting so far (how good was Del Toro with his limited screen time) but Kelly Marie Tran? Really? From dialogue to facial expression she was terrible throughout and every one of her scenes was borderline unbearable. Part of me was disappointed she survived the crash just because it means we'll have to see her again in the next installment. My main complaint was that the Last Jedi might have tried a little too hard to entertain with some cheesy moments and cute creatures. But hey there's a wide range of audience the movie has to appeal to. The Last Jedi set the perfect stage for a different spin on a classic. Let's hope the next chapter in the saga does not disappoint., 3.0,  Stephen Y, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/974737898/, January 22 2018, 
 And here we go with the toxic fandom. I quite enjoyed the Last Jedi it really reminds me of the mirror image world they are building with this new Star Wars trilogy. The thematic flow and mirroring of ESB makes this a stand out for me.<br><br>Who cares what Snokes back story is? It doesn't matter he's Snoke and he made Kylo turn to the Dark Side. Also if you ever payed the PnP Star Wars RPG back in the late 80s/early 90s you'd know that Force Projection is a thing. Oh and Leia was using Force Pull on the ship and rather than pulling the ship to her she pulled herself into the ship (again non-canon now but part of the EU). <br><br>It's clear the toxic fanboys have been busy reviewing this but this is actually quite a good movie if a bit long., 5.0,  James G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/901326716/, January 22 2018,

 The Last Jedi unfortunately doesn't work as a stand alone movie as a sequel or as an episode in the Star Wars universe. Judged on its own the characters as well as their motivations are unexplained and undeveloped and they don't do anything worthwhile with few exceptions. As a sequel it drops many things Episode VII set up and leaves very little to work with.<br><br>SPOILERS: Episode VII set up the First Order as an evil organization bent on galactic supremecy with their most important goal as finding the map to Luke Skywalker with Snoke as its mysterious and powerful leader. In Episode VIII the First Order wasn't shown to be evil and instead was mostly inept Snoke died quickly and Luke Skywalker barely made a difference to the Rebellion he unabandoned or to the First Order's plans.<br><br>The entire plot of the movie is a long slow chase where progressively more Rebellion members die or kill themselves. Fortunately Kylo Ren the leader of the First Order remains interesting and so Rey of the Rebellion still has someone to psychologically battle in the sequel though her backstory was also dropped. Unfortunately other characters' arcs from the Rebels in Episode VII like Po and Finn were wasted (and in their case ended up harming the Rebellion) while Carrie Fisher failed as a general but not in our hearts.<br><br>Some of my friends enjoyed parts of the movie so 2.5 stars., 2.5,  Andy B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977068175/, January 22 2018,

 I have no hard evidence to base this on but I suspect the audience rating is actually well below 49% and RT has capped the floor as to how low this rating can go. I don't know if this is "good polling" but I looked at several pages of reviews and it's all like half stars to 2 stars -- i.e. the low reviews are greatly outnumbering the good reviews.

 The movie was good in general but I wanted to see Luke spend a lot more time training Rey.

 I was expecting this movie to be great but I was greatly disappointed for the following reasons:<br><br>1. Bad uses of the force- Leia someone who never wielded a lighsaber could survive space? Rey being able to beat Luke within days/weeks of training?<br><br>2. Snokes death- supposedly he could trick and interpersonally connect ppl together but couldn't see (with the same minds he controlled) that Kylo Ren would kill him?<br><br>3. Rehashed Plot--last battle was a bad version of the battle of hoth.<br><br>4. Half the movie was a slow space chase...really? Why wouldn't the first order not catch one lone ship that couldn't hyperspace?<br><br>5. Capitalist utopia is evil animal rights is good 3rd wave feminism more could go on but this was the worst star wars movie I have ever seen.<br><br>I will still be eager to see 9 and other Star Wars flicks from Disney maybe but this seriously killed my faith in Disney star wars, 1.0,  Vike D, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977020891/, January 22 2018,

 Rian Johnson's epic Star Wars film doesn't fail to entertain. The Last Jedi does have some flaws but it's still an enjoyable surprising and original Star Wars film. There are so many unexpected yet emotional plot twists in this film. The character development in this film is strong as you can see each character face their own challenges and learn about topics they've never touched before. Despite this there are some flaws. Finn's subplot lacked as it didn't feel like Star Wars. It felt too politically similar to Earth. The idea of introducing heroines are great but don't introduce too many. The Last Jedi does. Despite this The Last Jedi contains the best action and visuals a Star Wars movie has ever seen emotional plot twists and is just so fun to watch and enjoy., 4.5,  Mason S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976848925/, January 22 2018,

 This is a smug charmless mess of a movie that sets new lows for screenwriting arrogance and incompetence. TLJ is paradoxically too clever for its own good and also profoundly stupid. A few visual masterstrokes can't redeem glaring plot holes or shallow underdeveloped characters. <br><br>The ruination of once-beloved icon Luke Skywalker is unforgivable especially in the service of a lazy low-stakes story. If a franchise feels compelled to destroy a cherished character it should at least be for a believable reason not because the writer's a creatively-bankrupt nihilist. <br><br>Throughout this insipid slog writer/director Rian Johnson exhibits sneering contempt for the audience the franchise and every single one of his [vastly superior] creative predecessors.

 I felt so angry after watching Last Jedi at the flicks over Xmas I signed up to Rotten Tomatoes to post my comic book store guy take on the Last Jedi. As a late-30ish Star Wars fan who can remember the Original trilogy I felt very angry at the way this movie came across. It was basically a middle finger F U and felt like they had only gotten the original cast back to trick me into seeing it. I had no issue with the original cast being written out of the movies to make way for the new generation. It was in the manner it was done. Han' s death in Force Awakens meant that at no point could the original cast meet each other (outside of being dead force ghosts) and felt like a terribly missed opportunity. This leads to the central issue of this movie Luke. Who is not a Luke I understand or recognise. He is an embittered old blue milk drinking wierdo who has lost his way and never redeems himself before dying whilst he plays a magic trick on Kylo Ren. Mark Hammil was clearly not happy with his lot in this movie either from the various press junkets he attended and the stuff he has said. I have issues with many things in this movie too much stuff to cover here. And other reviewers have objectively listed these far better than I could. Save to say that ultimately all of the issues and disappointment boil down to a poor turn from Luke for me. He is the spirit and core of the whole franchise and they wasted him to try and do some clever Luke is damaged routine. I feel sure that JJ Abrams would have had Luke studying the Jedi texts for last 10 years to become an amazing all powerful Jedi to come back and help his sister in her moment of need. Who by the way he completely abandons even to the point of her nearly dying in the vacuum of space. And a movie it's a poor disjointed mess. If the purpose was to get rid of all older Star Wars fans Disney have succeed by killing in the past literally. Finally to add I am not a bigot racist or sexist. I don't care about the ethnic and female empowering stuff I just want good Star Wars., 1.5,  Dave A, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977067973/, January 22 2018,

 The Last Jedi is the movie the Star Wars franchise needed. With excellent performances from Mark Hamill and Adam Driver as well as generally everyone on the cast the Last Jedi takes Star Wars as we know it and throws it at the spark that will light the First Order for the better. While at times the movie for me stops in its tracks until we get back to the good elements of the story it refreshes the franchise to keep things interesting instead of what we have known Star Wars to be predictable. Although change can generally result to the poor reviews the movie has gotten from fans it is all for the better and allows the franchise to continue going strong., 5.0,  Kyle P, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976966936/, January 22 2018,

 They needed to spend more time developing this.<br>The environments are bland lacking in mood and don't convey the feeling of a far away world. Because of this it was not very engrossing and had no moments of experiential fusion. There were no mysterious or interesting characters that lead to experience-taking. The star wars universe was the set for Luke's character the is a movie about the set now and the set isn't very good.The original Star Wars films were dream like and painterly and had an art film feel to it. Past directors also had a robust understanding of mechanics and technology.

 Guess my reaction to the Last Jedi Episode 8 by reviewing my predictions for Episode 9!<br><br>Episode 9:<br><br>Episode Nine begins with a panaromic view of space but with only one rebel ship and a giant Imperial Star Destroyer in the distance.<br><br>We are only minutes after the end of episode 8 and the rebel ship that has launched off the salt planet where our heroes escaped from a cave is of course still running out of gas! The tension is unbelievable!<br><br>The Imperial Star Destroyer sees the rebel ship and the bridge commander says: "We have you now! Only eight more hours and they'll be out of gas! Give chase!"<br><br>The camera turns toward the rebel ship and gets closer and closer until we are looking down a skylight at a room where Leia is lying on a bed.<br><br>The recent events have been too traumatic for Leia and she is dying because "she has lost the will to live."<br><br>Rey is kneeling beside her in tears.<br><br>Leia dying says:<br><br>"Oh my poor dear child! I know it now! You are my lost daughter! A druggie stole you from my cradle! And he took you away with his druggie wife! And all my life I've been looking for you! That's why I hugged you in Episode 7 instead of Chewbacca when I first saw you after all these years! Only now do I understand that strange impulse!"<br><br>Rey weeps and Leia dies.<br><br>The moment however might be too intense for children. So to lighten the mood a porg hops onto the death bed. And then another porg and another! It appears that the porgs have gotten off the Millenium Falcon and are now reproducing rapidly away from Chewbacca and other natural predators.<br><br>Finn comes in and says "What's wrong?"<br><br>Rey says "Hold me just hold me" and they hug.<br><br>"What's wrong?" asks Finn again.<br><br>"I'm Kylo-Ren's sister!" wails Rey. "And now my budding romance with him is at an end! O woe! And he looked great without his shirt on!"<br><br>"Kylo-Ren?" asks Finn in an overly emotional voice. "You mean Kylo-Ren is the boyfriend you've been keeping from me?"<br><br>"Yes!" Rey wails. "But when I met you he was only a long long distance fantasy. I had heard about him and of course everyone loves the baddest mass murderer in the galaxy! But I never thought I'd meet him in person! And now I can't love him anymore because I'm his sister!"<br><br>"Wait! I hear something!" says Finn and he turns to look out the window.<br><br>There he is! It's Luke! He is alive contrary to everyone's expectation! What a twist! The audience gasps in amazement! And he is flying toward the space ship with his light saber on!<br><br>The commander of the Imperial Star Destroyer sees Luke flying and announces "It's Luke Skywalker flying at 32 degrees! Prepare to fire with all cannons!"<br><br>"No!" says a terrifying voice. And the camera turns around and there standing on the bridge of the Star Destroyer is Snoke! He has used the force to put his body back together! The light saber made a clean cut and it was an easy task to glue himself back together again. However his body is slightly lopsided now.<br><br>"Don't fire at Luke!" says Snoke. "I want him as my new apprentice. He is turning to the dark side! We'll let him board the rebel ship and when they run out of gas we'll capture them all! Ha ha ha!"<br><br>But in case this is becoming too intense a joke ought to lighten to mood. Therefore Captain Phasma whose armor easily allowed her to survive her death scene in Episode 8 enters the bridge. And she is accompanied by a bunch of porgs! In fact when the camera turns back to the bridge there are porgs everywhere they are taking over the Imperial Star Destroyer! Their reproduction rate is astounding!<br><br>Meanwhile Luke flies through the open doorway of the rebel ship. He runs to Leia's bedside. But he is too late. She is already dead.<br><br>"Oh Rey!" he says. "I'm sorry. I've been such a cranky old man. You taught me to change my ways! You have everything you need to be the Jedi I should have been. I realize now that I must learn from you!"<br><br>"Luke!" screams Rey joyfully. "I have great news! You're my uncle!"<br><br>"Your uncle? But why didn't I sense that?"<br><br>"It's because you've separated yourself from the force all these years."<br><br>"Ah! That explains it!"<br><br>"Yes uncle and I'm sorry too. You're probably here because I stole your Jedi books."<br><br>"Yes niece. That was another sign that you're turning to the dark side. And what about when you clubbed me from behind with your stick!"<br><br>"Yes that might have been excessively violent I admit it" says Rey. "But I hope everyone still loves me anyway even though I assaulted you from behind because I was angry. At least if I hadn't stolen your books then Yoda would have burned them and all the Jedi knowledge would have been lost!"<br><br>"True true" says Luke. "You're even wiser than Yoda!"<br><br>"It's true I have everything I need already. So as soon as we run out of gas I'm going to visit my brother Kylo-Ren and --"<br><br>"Not so fast" says Luke. "I still have to die in the laser sword battle that we didn't have in the last episode. So I'm going to fly over to Kylo-Ren now and kill him. After all Leia and I agreed that he's beyond redemption. She really had no problem with me killing your brother."<br><br>"Go ahead uncle. I'm not worried. I can see the future. My brother will kill you and then after Finn dies no one will know about the incestuous relationship that I'm planning to establish with Kylo when we rule the galaxy together."<br><br> . . . . .

 Went in wanting to love it. The whole time I kept asking myself why the First Order didn't just jump a small fleet to light speed jump out ahead and blast the rebel fleet. And that's just one of the blaring inconsistencies. I can't even mention Leah's Marry Poppins moment where she wakes up in the vacuum of space and force flies back into the ship.

 Not really a star. Maybe a 1/8th star. And that's a gift.<br><br>This movie in a word is -- awful. <br><br>Let me list my grievances against Disney.<br><br>1. The mere fact that Disney has decided to release a star wars movie or story every 12 months has destroyed the magic. Period. Star Wars is now just another sci fy franchise. Nothing special. But hey who cares. It's all about the money and Disney is going to milk this baby.<br><br>2. The opening battle scene.<br> a. Poe's stupid slapstick banter with Hux is on par with Jar Jar Binks.<br> b. The lumbering WW2 bombers were horrible. Are you kidding me? Bombs away with Gravity type bombs? Sigh. Who's idea was that?<br><br>3. General Leia getting blown up and sucked out of the cruiser then using the "force" I guess to will herself back to life and propel herself back into the destroyed bay. Then they open - the - door that leads into the vacuum of space and she falls to the deck. OMG. This was poorly conceived and executed. <br><br>4. The slow speed chase of the first order fleet and the few remaining rebel ships. Why didn't the first order just order their star destroyers to jump into hyperspace and appear AHEAD of the rebel ships???????? This who chase was a violation of the RULES. It made it seem cheap like the writers gave the whole chase about 10 minutes of brainstorming and then said. "F- it let's just say they can't catch them what's for lunch?" <br><br>5. Rose. I know they wanted this character to work but she was awful Jar Jar binks awful. She goes against everything Star Wars is about. And she's dumb. So let me get this straight... Fin is about to sacrifice himself in order to save everyone else ( because if the first order's big gun blows a hole in the blast door the rebels are finished) but is thwarted by Rose at the last second because she wants to save just him??? What? So she saves Fin for a few seconds only to have the first order blow everyone away? Good thing Luke just so happens to show up and save the day for everyone. I mean Rose stopping Fin would be like Han knocking Luke out of the death star trench just before Vader shoots him so Han could "save what he loves. Yeah it doesn't make sense or feel good.<br><br>6. Fin's comment that it is OK to "tear up the town". So Star Wars is now preaching that mass mobs that go around looting burning and destroying towns is OK? Great. <br><br>7. Snoke. His demise is a classic example of having too many cooks. So I guess JJ Abrams came up with the idea of Snoke but old Rian said " I hate the guy." so much so that Rian chops him in half. So having all these Fan Boys writing Star Wars fan fiction makes the story uneven choppy and frankly disappointing -- since I found myself yearning for the George Lucas Prequels. <br><br>8. Poe. Get. Rid. Of. Him. His character is bad. His jokes are even worse and I am almost ready to put him on the level of little anakin Skywalker in terms of ridiculousness. <br><br>I could go on and on and on and on but I will end with this. Disney is RUSHING the movies so it is almost impossible to get a good cohesive story. Everything must be done on a schedule. We are getting processed fast food rather than a well though out feast. <br><br>Please Disney take your time with the next movie. It's our only hope..., 1.0,  todd B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977067200/, January 21 2018, 
 Rotten Tomatoes does not count 0 or 0.5 star ratings in the total. Which they should. Do they throw away 5 star ratings? Of course not. Anyway including the 1/2 star ratings the reviews from the last 18 pages (328 reviews) show a 36% audience rating not 49%. <br><br>In my opinion this is the worst Star Wars movie if you can call it Star Wars at all. More like a spaceballs spoof or "B" grade spaghetti space romp. Poor continuity between movies and scenes inappropriate joke placement flat characters and lack of character development absurd plot devices too many "gotcha" twists too many subplots which were irrelevant to the story or led to nothing being accomplished and too much soapboxing of contemporary political issues which will be dated in a few years. <br><br>The worst imho was the systematic tearing down of major beloved characters deconstruction of core values of the franchise "leave the past kill it if you have to" mentality. Its almost as if the writers hated the franchise and couldn't wait to tear into it with zest and enthusiasm.<br><br>Its hard to believe Disney and LucasFilm are that foolish to put out something as rancid as this under banner of one of the most revered franchises in 120 years of cinema.

 Been a fan since 1977 and I understand that things need to change but what I saw today was a terrible Star Wars film which lacked consistency decent humour and compelling characters. We got little in terms of new characters and seemed stuck with tried and tested formulas from previous films (disguise as officers to infiltrate a ship etc). Rey had the least interesting plot which left here staring out to the side of the screen most of the time. Finn was just Finn. Poe Dameron had the more to do this time but was in little danger throughot. Luke was reduced to a broken shell of a man which is certainly not what I wanted to see and Leia becomes Supergirl for no reason (Needs to be seen to be believed). Some strange plot holes and logic is nowhere to be found in both warring parties. I mean why fly straight at the enemy and be shot at. Even bombs must be dropped down in space where gravity does not exist. Redeeming features are nods to classic era but not enough to save this instalment., 1.5,  David C, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977066838/, January 21 2018,

 Never have I quit a movie before I got halfway through it. I'm the kind of person who tends to stick through even the worst just to see how bad things can get. I'm an avid Star Wars fan I grew up loving Star Wars I've read dozens of Star Wars novels I seen all the movies multiple times I even own Star Wars merchandise that being said this movie what's terrible I don't know if it got better towards the end but the beginning just got me to the point where I had to stop. The humor or attempts at humor were Beyond lame there's a conversation in the opening scene between a pilot of the good guys and a commander from the bad guys that is so out of place in a Star Wars movie that I actually was offended and that's not something that ever happens to me. I stuck through the Force awakens even though some of the humor left something to be desired but this movie is like low-grade Marvel superhero type humor. The writing it's all over the place Integrity of the series it's just thrown out the window for this one and about 45 minutes in do you realize that every person in charge seems to be a woman. I'm all for diversity but it's something that can definitely be overdone and this movie is a prime example of how to take it too far. I'm actually not able to call my cell Star Wars fan anymore and it appears that me and half the people that review this movie all think that this movie should not have been made. I might go see the next installment but it's going to have to be a vast improvement to get me back on board. Ask for the professional reviewers that have made this movie have a 90% fresh rating it just goes to show how out of touch professional reviewers are and I have a feeling that the obvious social equality issues that Weeknd the overall quality we're avoided topics which is understandable in today's everybody offended climate. If you enjoy Stupid humor and are easily app East that I recommend this movie if you are a true Star Wars fan I would Retreat to your novels and act like this movie never existed, 0.5,  Peter U, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/971795264/, January 21 2018, 
 A fim that divides the fan base needs no explanation to say the movie could be better and suffers from severe issues. While it may not be the worst film ever created it certainly is the worst Star Wars film ever made.<br><br>Don't trust critics on this one remember Critics never liked Lucas in his time making Star Wars.

 I loved it. Finally a woman who is a Jedi and we also got to see a side of Leia that we knew was always there. I loved the parallels: Snoke trying to convince Rey of joining the Dark Side just as Darth Sidious tried to make Luke join it. I also like the fact that Rey's training was similar to Luke's. Apart from all that each character has their own storyline and they all combine in a wonderful way. Adding on all the new creatures were awesome! Definitely recommend it. :), 5.0,  Ni F, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976242124/, January 21 2018,

 This is a fantastic movie.....mostly.<br>They handled a lot of the stuff PERFECTLY - especially all the stuff that people have been obsessively making stupid theories about.<br>And there are PLENTY of HOLY SHIT amazing moments.<br><br>But it's not perfect. <br><br>++VAGUE SPOILERS++<br><br>There's a whole side quest that's kind of...not great and feels really unnecessary.<br><br>Porgs are cool but I think they fulfilled the movie's allowance for CGI critters. The movie went a LITTLE too far beyond that.<br><br>The new "main character" doesn't feel like she needs to exist but she WOULD HAVE if she had just been given the skills of the guy who they go on the side quest to find. <br><br>And more than anything else the pacing of the movie is kinda weird.

 There is a small amount of disappointment to be had with the first third of "The Last Jedi". There is a sense of not caring during this first bit of the film where both the character interactions and plot delivery are performed in a lazy manner.<br>Thankfully it's a huge relief that two thirds of the film deliver what needed to be delivered from the continuing beloved franchise: familiar faces action unpredictable plot twists exploitation of character strengths and weaknesses and even moments that will quicken your pulse and make you sit at the edge of your seat. The film performs just well enough for us to wait in anticipation for the next episode. Overall "The Last Jedi" is a solid entry and nothing more.<br>Special kudos to Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver for getting most comfortable as their characters since the last episode. On that note continue to rest in peace Carrie Fisher., 3.5,  Grant W, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/975734541/, January 21 2018, 
 So many plots made little sense too much politically correct moments inserted into the movie all for strong women but definitely seems Disney has made it their role to make all the male roles into either stupidgreedy cowardly or grumpy. Whereas all the female roles are very strong characters. Which is fine. But this is Star Wars not Star Princesses. A little equality amongst the gender roles would be better. Lukes character direction is a joke and his death made him feel like a throwaway character. The prior films build up of Reys parents and Snokes Identity was totally pointless. The whole casino planet to get a splicer to help save the resistance was pointless. ONLY TO HEAR ROSE'S GIBBERISH ABOUT SAVING SPACE PONIES BEING WORTH IT. The only good part of the movie is the opening space battle to Rey and Kylo fighting together to Lukes standoff with the AT-AT'S. Literally probably no more than 10 or so minutes of this movie is worth watching., 1.0,  Robert Dwright S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/959092295/, January 21 2018, 
 The Last Jedi manages to forgo every plot thread established in the last installment for some kind of tonally misappropriated millennial tripe. Not only does it cease to develop any of the characters but actually manages to undo any progression from the previous film (I'm looking at you Po Finn and Rey). It is painfully obvious that these movies are being developed as standalone half-baked films instead of chapters in a cohesive framework., 1.0,  Stephen D, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977066411/, January 21 2018, 
 r/TheLastRebels come discuss the universe we know and love without being called a bot or a troll.<br><br>Disclaimer: This will be long. There will be criticism. None of it will be hate-fueled or prejudiced. Most of the most blatant criticisms of the plot have been stated hundreds of times so I'll try and only make points I haven't seen discussed as often. Also I'm not going to discuss the visuals. In the era of CGI and with a $200 million budget the movie had better be pretty at least. If that all sounds good then by all means read on.<br><br>In many reviews people will bring up the prequels. Already that should be a bad sign as they're clearly not the benchmark of the Star Wars series. It gets worse when you see that most people are stating that Disney's new film The Last Jedi has made them realize the prequels weren't all bad. At least they felt like Star Wars (a hard thing to describe but something anyone inspired by the Original Trilogy will understand). What the public has been given in The Last Jedi is a modern deconstruction of the Star Wars mythos (very intentionally) dragged along by a weak plot and shallow characters. And maybe worst of all it just isn't a fun film. This is Star Wars not 'Mother!'. Viewers shouldn't come out of the theater confused. That's not to say that Star Wars is 'for children' as many people would have you to believe. The Original Trilogy was a huge inspiration for many many people involved in the film industry today. There's a reason why Disney paid old Georgie so much for the property. What I can't figure out is why they paid the toll if all they wanted to do was destroy it?<br><br>A line from the film which has been much discussed seems to be the mantra of the film. "Let the past die. Kill it if you have to." I can see Rian Johnson mouthing the words in excitement as he sat behind the camera filming the scene. I had no feelings about the man before this film. Looper to me was mediocre and that was the extent of my experience with his work. The question is did Disney really allow him full creative control with no oversight or did they bring him on (director change is usually a red flag) because he was willing to fulfill their specific vision of Star Wars. The answer seems clear once you view the film. <br><br>What people need to realize is that when we as fans criticize the inclusion of real world politics in Star Wars that doesn't mean that we're against the message. This saga was never meant to be an on-the-pulse take of the current political landscape but in space. It's a mythic tale of good versus evil and the common connection that unites all life. In a way The Last Jedi has somehow become a microcosm of American politics. Everything becomes divisive and each side chooses the weakest argument of the opposition and touts it as proof that they're right. Some people are criticizing the film for 'SJW' overtones and the feeling of diversity for diversity's sake. The thing is when you read through actual people's reviews of the movie it is a very small minority that use these points as valid criticism. Most are decrying the 'chase movie' plot the lack of real character development and the absolute disregard for the way The Force Awakens was constructed. And yet those that enjoyed the film feel the need to include terms like 'haters' 'trolls' 'fanboys' (is that bad? I know plenty of disappointed fangirls as well). They tell potential viewers to 'ignore the hate' say that people simply had their expectation quashed (not untrue) or point the the amount of money the film has grossed as vindication (it's Star Wars it's going to make money no matter what). I never thought I'd live to see the day where liking Star Wars became a divisive issue and yet here we are.<br><br>Of course form your own opinion of the movie. But when fans that have enjoyed every installment of the franchise up until this point feel the need to post warnings to others about the nature of the film something is seriously wrong. There are articles galore about "Why You're Wrong If You Thought The Last Jedi Was Bad" or "Why Rey Doesn't Need Training" or "Why This Is The Star Wars We Needed". The real issue is that they feel these things need to be explained at all outside of the film. That's a failure by the writer/director (same guy). Star Wars has always had tons of peripheral material in all forms of media but I shouldn't need to read novels and comics just to understand why characters are the way there are in the movies. <br><br>Honestly I'm not sure where to start with criticism of the film. The more I think about it the more I realize that I barely enjoyed a single sequence simply because of how strange it was. From the first sequence between Poe and Hux (Prank call? Really?) to Luke unceremoniously tossing the saber after a two-year long cliffhanger I felt as if I'd been bashed over the head and watched the rest of the movie in a fog. I know anecdotes aren't the best evidence but the theater I saw the movie in was strangely quiet all the way through the end especially for how much 'humor' there was throughout. <br><br>Personally I was in the camp that was severely disappointed in The Force Awakens because I was not expecting a reboot (it's A New Hope with a new coat of paint try and argue against it). Still it was well-crafted and had that magic feel to it (though I think a lot of that came from Harrison Ford for me at least). Same with Rogue One. There were a few things I would have done differently but I can say that about almost all movies. Criticism does not equal hate or even dislike it's simply thoughtful questioning instead of just absent-mindedly consuming whatever is on the screen. All in all I enjoyed Rogue One and thought the ending battle was among the best scenes in the franchise. Both were equally diverse in their casting (if not more so) than TLJ and while the vocal minority decrying these changes was still there we didn't see anything close to the divisiveness of TLJ. Many people who liked Finn in TFA felt let down by how his character was treated in this film. Many people who liked Rey and wanted more backstory on why she is who she is were disappointed to only see more of the same 'master-of-all-trades' abilities that made people question just how good of a protagonist she can be if she doesn't have to struggle. Many people who liked Poe and wanted to see more of him (since he was barely in TFA) were disappointed when he was reduced to being made an example of after saving the whole of the Resistance in the previous movie. We get it Rian. Everyone is flawed. Everyone fails. None of us are saying we didn't want struggle or hardship. Hell the heroes of Rogue One all get obliterated at the end of the movie. However when a single theme is so ever-present throughout the movie it feels like the director is trying to beat it into the audience's head with a stick instead of letting the story do the talking.<br><br>There are two things I will touch on that everyone else has and that is the treatment of Leia and Luke. Again many of us had accepted that Luke would most likely die in this movie. Many of us would have been okay with him being 'disillusioned' with the Jedi order as it were. But when you take every quality that people loved about one of the most iconic characters in history and tear it down to the ground without any hope of redemption then you should expect a negative reaction. Everything about him was just wrong even down to little details such as how his 'Force ghost projection lightsaber' (a phrase I never thought I'd use) is blue (Anakin's) instead of the green one he built himself. As many have said it honestly feels like this film was made by someone who had only a passing interested in Star Wars or actively hated it. That's not to say a fan should necessarily direct the film but someone who cares for and understands the franchise certainly should. I'm not sure what to say about Leia. It seems the one thing that unites most people no matter their opinion of the film is just how odd the so-called "Mary Poppins scene" was. It was weird unexplained largely senseless and worst of all none of the characters in the movie said anything about it. They all just kind of accepted that it happened and moved on. I thought they both acted well in the roles they were given but the roles they were given were off-putting to say the least. <br><br>I'm just going to run through criticisms that I agree with but have been expanded upon elsewhere: the 'gotcha-ism' of the entire plot deus ex machina BB-8 (most powerful character in the new trilogy) use of bombs/ridiculously slow bombers in space fuel (when has this ever been a concern in Star Wars ever) technologically and numerically superior First Order can't figure out how to capture/stop/surround one Rebel ship terrible strategic decisions made at every turn on both sides continuation of nostalgia driven plot from TFA (Dagobah rehashed Luke/Yoda rehashed Hoth rehashed) how did Finn and Rose know the plan to tell the 'hacker' the character of the hacker the whole prequel-esque Canto Bight sequence how were Rose and Finn able to get to Canto Bight/why didn't they escape that way total non-explanation of timeline from last movie and throughout the different storylines Rose being Finn's moral compass Holdo Force Facetime Snoke and his death weird throne room fight scene with Zoro-style action no reason to be afraid of villains Rose/Finn in the speeders Yoda acting strangely ("not a page turner") and using Force Ghost lightning Luke non-plussed by Han's death Rey continuing to act with rage and violence even against Luke (anger leads to hate etc). Captain Phasma wasted again Captain Phasma/Finn rivalry<br><br>Worst of all might be the hyperspace kamikaze scene which by all accounts breaks everything we know about the universe and begs the question why that hadn't been done all the other times the Rebels were fighting losing battles. The list goes on. I know at a certain point I'm probably nitpicking but the problems seem to proliferate the more deeply I think about the film. Honestly what even is the message of this film? That failure is okay? That anyone can be a Jedi (and yet you're still randomly chosen)? In the end the characters that survived are in nearly the same position they were at the beginning. The only real changes are Kylo is in power Luke is gone (again) and the Resistance is in shambles. They could have put the whole plot of this film in the opening scroll of the next one and call it a day. Star Wars is one of if not my favorite franchises of all time and I can honestly say that even if this wasn't a SW movie it would have been mediocre to me. It is however part of a saga with a rich history. That history is the reason why many people see the new iterations not because of anything Disney has done. And yet they treat that history like a stain that needs to be erased so a new era can be born. I've never seen so many people have such a visceral reaction to a movie though Star Wars has always been unique. There are thousands of reviews which state they only came to this site and made an account to voice their displeasure of the film. Honestly I'm one of those people. I review movies by myself or with my friends never in a public forum. I didn't do it for the prequels or The Force Awakens even though I had many criticisms. For myself and many others The Last Jedi turned out to be The Last Straw.<br><br>The one star I've awarded is symbolic. This is the only movie I can ever remember wishing that it didn't exist instead of simply never viewing it again. I've never been one to decry people for liking things I don't but I do not comprehend how anyone can defend this movie beyond saying it looked nice. If that's all that matters to you more power to you. That doesn't mean you get to write off those who hated it.<br><br>As a side note there is no way the audience score is 49% considering the sheer volume of 1/2 and 1 star reviews. Not sure if that is intentional or the byproduct of RT's rating system (perhaps 2 1/2 or 3 star counts as 'positive'?).

 Exactly what I wanted from a Star Wars film. It was great to see Luke as a much more developed character instead of the cookie-cutter hero from the original trilogy.

 Visually some of the coolest stuff we've seen done with Star Wars. Storywise what the hell was this? As others have said it completely throws away all the questions that were introduced in The Force Awakens and which you assumed would set up the sequel. (And yes I know the The Force Awakens was basically a remake of A New Hope. I'm 47 and saw A New Hope opening weekend as a kid and have been all things Star Wars my entire life). I can see why Disney would have been inclined to give Rian Johnson his own new trilogy to develop but he should not have been given Episode 8 because he obviously had no intention to develop the story that JJ Abrams introduced. And again as an old school SW fan what he did with Luke Skywalker is completely insulting to the franchise. I might see it once more but I will not be seeing this one the 4 or 5 times in the theater that I have with every other SW release., 2.0,  Daniel K, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/842676685/, January 21 2018, 
 If I could have given this a zero I would have. For all the same reasons as the other reviews as a longtime fan of Star Wars I felt that the new move completely disregarded everything we've come to love in the series and placed ill-timed awkward humor in it to boot. Though the actors are incredible I felt the poor directing really made their performances stiff and unconvincing especially in the beginning of the film. It feels as though all the characters have changed with no development to explain why or to justify it., 0.5,  Priscilla B, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/840019741/, January 21 2018, 
 So it has been 5 weeks since I saw The Last Jedi on opening night and I am still bothered by this movie. I have walked out of movies before and didn't give it a second thought. This film is different. There is so much that is bad about this film. The humor is cringe. Rey is a Mary Sue on steroids. Kylo Ren is boring. New characters are boring and annoying (I'm looking at you Rose). There are huge gaping plot holes and questions from The Force Awakens left unanswered or answered so stupidly I ask myself what was the point? <br><br>However I think all of that could have been forgiven if they had not assassinated desecrated then discarded Luke Skywalker like day old rubbish. I really believe what bothers most people myself included is what they did to Luke Skywalker. He is unrecognizable. They had the once in a lifetime opportunity to bring back Luke f@#$ing Skywalker in all his glory and they botched it! They took the most powerful Jedi ever a beacon of hope and optimism and turned him into a total loser. What?! Why?! It is so confusing. I am sorry to tell those who want to move on from the Skywalker story but...Star Wars is... Luke Skywalker. He is ever present. The main title theme is Luke's theme. The force theme plays for him as well but it plays when the force is present for anyone as well Obi-Wan Yoda Rey etc. Luke IS Star Wars. If you don't like it look elsewhere. Clearly people like it or this would not be the most famous movie saga ever. Star Wars is not just a movie but a cultural phenomenon that has been passed down generations for decades. We will never see the likes of it again. <br><br> I have been a fan for 40 years. 40 years! Luke Skywalker was my childhood hero. I know I am not alone. This is why so many people are bothered by this movie. You cannot fundamentally change the character. Zack Snyder tried to do the same with Superman. We do not like a brooding Superman. It fundamentally changes the character and people will reject it. So they desecrated Luke Skywalker then they killed him. I know Luke Skywalker can't live forever but his death should have come 2 or 3 movies from this one and his death should be so epic that it leaves a black hole in its wake. That is what he deserves. A death so grand the whole galaxy will feel it and never forget it. Can you image seeing that version? Instead we get the worst scene ever. Even the binary sunset couldn't bring the feels. Worst of all he dies alone. Alone! Luke Skywalker dies alone! Why?! <br><br>One would ask why they would do this? Where is the continuity between the OT and this sequel trilogy? Where is the continuity between The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi? The answer to both is there is none. Why you ask? Because this new trilogy is not a sequel. It is a reboot. They are systematically trying to destroy the old and bring in the new. That is why both the Force Awakens and The Last Jedi are rehashes of Star Wars Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. I am sure the remaining few beloved characters will be slaughtered by the end of the next movie. The transition will be complete and the history erased. I am confused by this. Disney usually knows where their bread is buttered. Yes this movie made money but the future films will suffer because they have alienated the fan base. There is no way this new generation will care for the saga the way my generation did. Star Wars will not survive this. I am sad for it. The saga is hemorrhaging. It will be dead in 10 years at this rate. <br><br>Again I am confused by all of this. Disney knows where their bread is buttered. Look at what one Darth Vader scene did for Rogue One. Can you imagine what a similar scene with Luke Skywalker would have done for The Last Jedi? The world will never know. <br><br>Lastly I am so sorry Mark Hamill. You can see how affected he is by this new trilogy. He is completely and utterly heartbroken by what they did to his character and story. Mark deserved better than this., 1.5,  Carl M, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977066265/, January 21 2018,

 An absolute travesty of a film. Poor plot no real character development the quintessential Mary-Sue the utter destruction of the profound themes of the original trilogy to be replaced with modern shallow social justice nonsense. The humour was out of place and awkward and they destroyed a beloved childhood hero because...I don't know why. I will not bother with episode 9 or any other of Rian Johnson's cinematic excretions.

 First off please do NOT give half-star ratings give at least ONE FULL star because there is rumor that half-stars will not be counted!<br><br>Apart from that another reviewer already described the fan reaction to "Last Jedi" best: Disney what would you say if someone would do things like fundamentally changing the looks and personality of Mickey Mouse have Donald try to kill one of his nephews for misbehaving and literally ignoring everything that people loved about those characters up to the point that they are killed off without proper respect and being replaced by new ones that are totally unrealistic / uninspired / bland just for the sake of being 'diverse'?<br><br>EXACTLY!!<br><br>But I would like to add one thing:<br><br>Disney WE WILL NEVER FORGET WHAT YOU DID how you ruined the greatest space opera of all time with INCOMPETENCE CARELESSNESS GREED and POLITICAL AGENDA. WE WILL *ALWAYS* REMEMBER whenever there is a new Disney movie whenever we see a Disney toy whenever we see the Disney logo anywhere and WE WILL TELL OUR COLLEAGUES AND OUR FRIENDS AND OUR CHILDREN what kind of company you truly are a company that gives a damn about quality as long as it just makes money a company that shows the middle finger to long-time loyal fans as soon as a new generation is on the horizon.

 Sounds like the idiot director (Rian Johnson) in charge of this abortion used Star Wars as a vehicle for his (and his institution's) politics. The same loathsome leftist social political crap that keeps getting shoved down our throats these days. No wonder critics love it and audiences hate it. That bogus 90% is just a monument to critics' pretentiousness. They will watch this movie with self-inspired teary eyes while penning their pointless disingenuous crap trying to convince people this movie isn't hot garbage while pushing their regressive left wing agenda.<br>Rey is just a vacuous Mary Sue anyway and Kylo Ren is a joke so even apart from SJW politics it's not like this movie was ever really going to be good. Like many others I'll definitely be passing on this fetid sack of turds.<br><br>Also lol@ at anyone falling for the random 5 star one sentence reviews stating this movie is good and punctuated with exclamation points. That's just Disney's gorilla marketing being spammed by some third party they've hired to convince people this movie isn't pure crap.<br><br>Edit: Notice that 49% audience rating not going down even though there are noticeably more negative reviews than positive ones? Gee... I wonder what that's about. Gotta control that narrative right RT?<br>Those trying to rob others of their voice by claiming negative reviews are fake are fascist hypocrites who've become they thing they claim to hate. <br><br>Fight back against this Orwellian garbage while we still can...<br>...And ffs Disney fire Kathleen Kennedy already..., ni,  Scowly X, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976483286/, January 21 2018,

 I put half a star cause It's better than the previous movie by far.<br><br>What could I say that hadn't been said Rey continues to be a Mary Sue a character I don't care at all of Ridley has improved her performance tho. Kylo Ren continues to be a pathetic villain also a little less tho cause is in this movie he doesn't get his ass kicked by a Janitor-trooper and a junkwoman. Luke character doesn't has anything to do with the Luke from the original trilogy apart from the name and a long etc that this movie don't deserve my time writing.<br>By the way I used to be a huge Star Wars fan I remained that way even after the mess with the prequels but I think I'm not anymore ... it's clearly the lady from Disney that I don't even know her name and I really don't care knowing it wants to tell another story I don't care about. Creating a story where the only heroes are women like Mary Sue Rey Rose (What a pathetic character that don't even let Finn character have a purpose) The commander with violet hair (Where did she came from? What was the idea with her? Couldn't they just make Admiral Akbar be the hero?) Leia flying like Mary Poppins when any other force user haven't ever do something similar (Not even the Emperor when Vader killed him by throwing him to that hole) and making her the only main character that survives from the original trilogy (Ironically being her dead in real life).

 After the insipid and expensive exercise in fanboyism that was The Force Awakens I was hoping the sequel would pay me back for having to pay full price to sit through a best-of compilation of every previous Star Wars movie but played by different actors. And BOY did The Last Jedi deliver. This franchise got the shot in the arm it needed to stay relevant. It's bold it's funny and it allows it's characters to fail and fail catastrophically.

 I am a life long Star Wars fan and I hated this movie. I want to care about the next generation of Star Wars characters but they are not interesting and are poorly developed. <br><br>The Disney political correctness and social commentary on Kantu Bight sicken me. The plot overall was incoherent. The kinetic Star Wars energy is sorely lacking. Instead of high speed trench runs we got a freighter crawling through space trying to not run out of fuel. <br><br>Not only did the creative team ax Star Wars tradition and lore but they axed the intriguing story lines from The Force Awakens. They also took an ax to the character of Luke Skywalker and to Star Wars fans themselves. <br><br>Let the past die. Kill it. What a terrible theme for a movie with such a respected past. <br><br>This had the most boring chase scene in all of history.<br><br>The feminism was overt and over the top. Disgusting.<br><br>This movie really had Star Wars ships running out of fuel.<br><br>This movie had Chewie guilted out of eating meat.<br><br>This movie had a black man tasered over a parking tickets and then him breaking out of jail and running over cops apparently killing them and then the black man burning down a town in essence and celebrating it because the inhabitants were rich. Way to go Disney Rian Johnson Kathleen Kennedy: using a Star Wars movie to stoke racial and class tensions in a Star Wars movie. Makes me want to vomit. <br><br>I've never hated a movie until now. I hate this movie and can't stop thinking about how much I hate it. <br><br>Along with this negative review I will use my dollar votes to protest this abomination. I will spend no more money on Star Wars after this wretched movie. No more movie tickets disks greeting cards toys posters memorabilia nothing. Not one red cent. <br><br>Where does the next movie go? Looks like French Revolution.

 There's so much wrong with this movie that I don't even know where to begin. The pacing is terrible the character development is terrible (you could delete the entire Finn + Rose scenes and it would have no impact on the rest of the film) and for a 2.5 hour film it felt like a lot of nothing happened. <br><br>Worst of all this didn't even feel like a Star Wars movie. I feel like the creators of this and the last one are either rehashing old material from the previous films as a throwback or trying to make it more PC by casting every ethnicity but typical white person as a main character so that they can appeal to everyone. Forget about trying to please everyone or to make an action-packed film and get back to Star Wars roots. The main films were about the characters not the action.

 I saw Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Power Ranger in the theater today. I have so much to say about it now. I thought reading the Wikipedia entry had prepared me for it but the experience exceeded all my expectations!<br><br>Contrary to what I had expected from reading the summary the whole story was NOT pointless. The end of the movie leaves the story in a significantly different place from when it started. For most movies you might take that for granted but from reading the reviews I wasn't sure that was going to be the case but it was and that was nice. You won't be able to skip over this movie and still understand the Disney Star Wars trilogy.<br><br>I liked the way Mark Hamill portrayed Jake Skywalker a grizzled old Jedi Master clearly inspired by Luke Skywalker. The fact that they got the same actor to play both characters is a nice touch.<br><br>I liked the way Jake Skywalker tried to educate the audience in the ways of the George Lucas Star Wars universe (e.g. the Force is not just for Jedis Luke Skywalker can't defeat the Empire just by waving a laser sword).<br><br>I liked some of the dialogue between Rey and Kylo (the "You're a monster" "Yes. I am" bit was particularly nice) and I sort of liked the Twilight-over-Skype-themed relationship they developed while a high-stakes space battle was raging elsewhere. (A space battle which knowing what I knew about the plot had me asking "Why are you throwing away this med-ship foolish #Resistance? If lightspeed ramming is a thing in your story why not have the med-ship ram the star destroyer? Why does the First Order not have custom-built lightspeed-equipped missiles for destroying enemy ships in one shot? Why don't both sides have such missiles? Why sixty years after Star Wars are they STILL flying around X-Wing fighters and basic TIE fighters?" But I digress...)<br><br>I also liked the space cows. The fact that they were made vaguely bipedal only enhanced how nonspecifically-disturbing they seemed. It was a nice touch.<br><br>My biggest takeaway: I am in awe. I'd like to say that I had no idea it was possible for a movie to be ludicrously bad on so many levels simultaneously--I'd like to say that but I've seen /Thor/ directed by Branagh so it would be false. Still in terms of characterization plot structure originality world-building military tactics logic and pacing--the Last Power Ranger manages to be bad at ALL of these. There were definitely times during the movie when I could not stop laughing.

 Worst Star Wars film ever. I felt similar to how I felt leaving the theater after seeing The Phantom Menace at age 13 except worse. Which is hard to do. I'm a die-hard fan of the OT. I did think this movie would be different and it was but I didn't think it would also be bad. Rian really tricked us fans with this one the trailers gave little to no idea of what we were in for and I realized why almost right away. Sometimes you can tell a movie is going to be bad only a couple minutes in. Pacing is very important and certain parts felt rushed others too slow. There were of course even bigger issues many of which have been mentioned many times over. Not sure I need to repeat those. I was wrong to purchase tickets on opening night I should have waited until word got out of how bad this was. I'm baffled by the 90% score but have come to the conclusion that Disney and Rian Johnson are most likely in bed with critics. I've now lost all interest in future Star Wars films. What is there to care about these new characters they tried to force on us? I re-watched TFA after this and the difference in quality was massive I'm one of those who appreciated the nostalgia in that one. I thought it could have been a bit better but overall I really liked it and felt things were headed in a good direction. Not so with The Last Jedi. I'll know not to give Disney more money. Out of all of the flaws in this movie Luke dying the way he did was the single part I hated most. I could have ignored a boring aimless film like this if Luke had survived. At least then Episode 9 could have still had a fighting chance to be good. But IMO they killed him and Snoke off early and did Luke in the stupidest way possible.

 As a huge marvel-style humor fan and a self-identifying SJW (where the hell was the alien representation?) I obviously have some different views than some of the negative ratings. I nonetheless agree with the majority of the commentary and believe like most of the audience that critics don't know what the hell they are talking about and this was by far the worst star wars movie. In summary fuck you Disney. While the media goes crazy about the next episode I'll be at home watching Star Trek., 1.0,  Nathan D, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977066931/, January 21 2018, 
 Ladies and Gentlemen this isn't a film much less a Star Wars film. Whether you like Star Wars or not is irrelevant to your enjoyment of this movie whether you identify with or care about the heavy-handed inclusion of the injected social narratives and the underpinnings of those people that are behind the film will determine whether you'll enjoy it. So much in this movie was changed from or went against past messages in the older movies that it's unrecognizable as Star Wars. There's so much done wrong in The Last Jedi even compared to The Farce Awakens that to sum it all up succinctly in a single sentence is simply an impossibility so to that end I'll just try to unpack all of this in as orderly of a fashion as I can.<br><br>Let's start with perhaps the least damaging **** up this train wreck of a movie managed to accomplish and that's all of the nerdy stuff and technical aspects of the lore that were brutally ravaged. Shields worked entirely when they needed to or didn't need to in The Last Jedi whether they were the First Order's dreadnought's Snokes' ship or the rebel cruiser's new technologies were invented from thin air to serve as plot contrivances force powers did whatever the story called for with Rey's inexplicable proficiency and knowledge of the force being the most damning.<br><br>I'll stop here as this list goes on... and on and on and on... but sadly there is much more to address and the technical and lore aspects of the film aren't even the worst victims of Kathleen Kennedy's and Rian Johnson's Frankenstein creation.<br><br>This film to put it bluntly simply and succinctly was just a vehicle for both social and political views and was not meant to serve primarily as a Star Wars film. The whole movie's rife with these messages and examples which aren't themselves fundamentally bad I hasten to add but the way they're implemented ruins and distracts from the movie itself as they often purposefully come into direct conflict with past Star Wars themes. One example of this ham-fisted inclusion of modern social engineering is certain blatant narratives go out of their way to say all of the story heroism and characters from the original trilogy-and even the prequels-were morally and ethically wrong or foolish or misinformed. This movie even tries to undermine the thought of sacrificing yourself for a good cause when there's seemingly no other choice which doesn't even make sense when considering that this film comes right after two movies that told stories about doing just that. Spoiler Warning: The instance I refer to is the character Rose's collision with Fin seemingly to stop him from having a heroic moment this is then presented as Rose correcting Fin from doing something regrettable and foolish. However were it not for Luke's deus ex machina arrival moments afterward and his own subsequent sacrifice the remaining resistance members would have perished and thus made Rose's words ring hollow.<br><br>Perhaps worst of all for Star Wars fans specifically however is what is being seen by all that cherish Lucas era Star Wars to be the absolute worst revival of an old character in cinema history. Luke Skywalker returns to us in the Last Jedi but not as himself. In Mark Hamill's own words it is better to call this new character Jake Skywalker or some other name given the complete removal from Luke's original character and morality in the film. To put it simply Luke's identity has been assassinated thoroughly by The Last Jedi Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson and undermined to such an extent that it's clear that either Kathleen K Rian or Disney itself wished to see his legacy carry on just as they had portrayed his appearance in the Star Wars movie franchise: alone apathetic weak uncaring and disappointing. <br><br>It is so often the case with sequels that sometimes they are still enjoyable if you are not invested in the earlier films but I cannot say in good conscious that this is the case with The Last Jedi as even its cinema fundamentals are so poorly executed as to be laughable. <br><br>I end this review of Star Wars : The Last Jedi saying this: you shouldn't bother wasting your time money or even your ire on this film. The Last Jedi is simply hollow and a sad sad tragedy in the annals of cinema., 1.0,  Merlos T, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977066629/, January 21 2018, 
 After a second viewing many moments that came off as nonsensical or as shocking just for the sake of shock value I now see as well thought out and brilliant direction meant to inject new life into a franchise that desperately needed to go in a new direction. And I am happy to say I am thrilled to see how it all culminates in the final act. THAT Leia moment and the several Deus Ex Machinas towards the film's finale hold it back from being on the same level as The Empire Strikes Back. 4 out of 5 stars., 4.0,  Joshua G, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977066922/, January 21 2018, 
 This movie is so bad it made the prequels seem like masterpieces! Visually it is nice but the story is a mess of plot holes and it drops basically everything the Copy Paste movie Star Wars 7 setup. I was so sad I spent money watching TFA but it doesn't even compare to this! Lea is now a force user and apparently not able to die after being blown up and sucked out in space. Snoke is ridiculously powerful and the leader of the First order and also irrelevant and dead! WHAT!!! And Rey who isn't daughter of any one special beats imperial guards after only knowing about the force for a week!!! Kylo is just as powerful but had years of training isn't as good! Mary Sue!!! Finn and Rose dude plot was completely irrelevant and Rose saves Fiin because saving a friend is important.... but letting everyone gets blown up! Dumb shit! And they humiliated Mark Hamil by nerfing and murdering Luke! EVERYTHING IN THIS MOVIES IS HORRIBLE!!! NOT GOING TO WATCH ANY disney STAR WARS MOVIES AGAIN!, 1.0,  San J, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/845205851/, January 21 2018, 
 So many unnecessary side plots. A lot of time spent on side stories and new characters that have no actual relavance in the final grand scheme of things. Especially Laura Derns charcter which could have just been an autopilot function and instead ofall that time to introduce Benecio del Toro why not just make Rose the expert?? A few great shots with a lot of pointless story arcs., 2.0,  Nathan S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/977066874/, January 21 2018, 
 Divisive identity politics in a Star Wars movie? Are you joking me? This movie is dated by the ideas of the here and now. It cannot hold up in the future therefor it's not a timeless story as the original trilogy was. Wooden characters although Mark Hamill did a terrific job. Luke Skywalker is Mark Hamill's legacy. For Mark Hamill to act brilliantly on a script that destroyed to a degree his legacy took more courage than I could ever have. Bravo Mark! That is a man of character if I've ever met one!, 2.5,  Ken S, https://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/976966981/, January 21 2018,
