As an adult male, the best part about this movie were the cute little penguin things and the disgruntled caretakers. That\'s it. I expected more from Luke coming back, but it was just a disappointment. Perhaps the best part of TFA was the teasing the return of Luke at the end. For so many men of my age, it would be like bringing back a part of their childhood. I\'m sad to say, they never should have brought the character back. He, and Mark Hamill, deserve better than that. <br><br>Also, while trying to be "diverse" in casting/role development, Hollywood still remains mysteriously racist towards Asian males and keeps driving the whole agenda that Asian females are to be incorporated into their world in stereotypical roles. You can tell they purposely cast a throwaway Asian on the First Order ship just to cut between him and the first Asian sister who sacrificed herself to set off the bombs. I am sure not many noticed it because they aren\'t Asian, but on a rewatch, they had a very specific cut between their two faces, back to back. Horrible First Order Asian male; heroic Asian female rebel killed by male\'s actions. You don\'t really see any other Asian males until the Casino subplot, where another Asian male pops up as one of those "bad people" profiting off of selling weapons so they can gamble decadently. To be fair, there was one older Asian male in the background of a rebel meeting, and I do believe the other new SW movies did try to add some in the background. I did praise Rogue One\'s treatment of Asian males until I read that they were supposed to be homosexual, which is a another common treatment Hollywood has for them (see Captain Sulu). Also, Rose ended up the Julie to Ross (Finn) and Rachel (Rey), in what was a completely superfluous plot development. This was just an awful love triangle, and completely unnecessary. <br><br>Just like the "Diversity Oscars" a year or two ago, Hollywood doesn\'t care about being truly diverse or fair when it comes to race. They just care about what is popular at the time. So if Race X or Gender Y is popular now, and they fall into the trap of bombarding us with those casting choices, how is that different when the White Male was the most popular choice? It isn\'t. It\'s just a different decade, and a different trend.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977048236/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/10160082953645556/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977048236/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 12, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="10"></span></div> Horrendous.

Money talks as they say.<br>Anyway back to the film, what can i say which hasnt been said. It just doesnt make any sense. You now have a main character who can go to toe with Luke Skywalker, even betters him, all without any training. You have irrelevant side quests and characters, the Casino and codebreaker plot, which you could remove from the film, and it would make a slight bit of difference. An irrelevant character, who no one cares about.. Rose.<br>Killed off the main villain, killed off Luke Skywalker. Leia should have died, but somehow can now survive after death, in space aswell may i add.<br>This trilogy is no trilogy, there is nothing to look forward to in episode 9.

Sure the saga has had some missteps with the first, two films in the prequel trilogy. The Last Jedi, is truly the pinnacle terrible script writing and directing. Rian Johnson, has killed this franchise. His directing and writing skills have destroyed this film. The film is eye candy for sure. But it boils down to nothing less than a movie you can turn you brain off to watch. This is a terrible Star Wars film, but a mediocre action film you can turn your brain off too. I hope Disney do the right thing and get this god awful director away from this dying franchise.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Lee D."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977048197/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Lee D</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 12, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> I watched it twice, because the first time I was in shock.

And that\'s the point.<br>I can understand some people see this film and just think it\'s awful. I get it. It\'s nothing that any of us expected. It was a curve ball of the highest order.<br>I saw the first film in 1977 and that was it for me. Hooked. Complete fan boy for as long as I can remember. I care what happens to the characters.<br>Is it the Star Wars movie that I would have made. Nope. It\'s not. But what Rian Johnson has done is blasted the series wide open. Star Wars is no longer black and white. it\'s grey and unpredictable.<br>Luke Skywalker\'s path in the movie is just brilliant. I think one major point in the film is that Luke himself believes that (and he says as much) he cant just walk out and go at the First Order with his "lazer sword". As he pushes passed the regret he held in the movie he realises that in order to truly help, he must become "more powerful than you can possibly imagine". How? At the time of the Force Awakens, Luke is a myth. A story. An old one. By the end of the movie he is legend.<br>he is the guy who stood up to the First Order, took laser death to the face and stayed standing.<br>As the film ends you can see that inspiration played out with the little kids in Canto. Not only did luke save the few people left in the resistance but HE was the one that "Sowed the Seed" to inspire a generation to fight back. Genius.<br><br>Added to that, some folk has said about the whole Canto thing being throw away. This, for me was also a genius move. It showed that sometimes the good guys can get it wrong. They can fail. All that effort for nothing. It humanized them, made them more fallible.<br><br>So for me, yes, there was a little too much tongue in cheek humour in parts but the fact is, i did laugh. I did enjoy it.<br><br>But the best thing for us, the fans, is that Star Wars is no longer the predictable, albeit brilliant behemoth it once was. Change can be hard, but for me, it is essential if the series is to remain relevant.<br><br>Good luck JJ.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/788782505/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/8213573/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/788782505/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Kevin F</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 12, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> This film is a Hugh cluster of a director wanting to do his own thing, advancing social/political narratives over constructing a decent plot, and setting himself up for his own trilogy of films instead of focusing on the task at hand in making a great sequel to The Force Awakens.<br><br>Almost everything misses the mark in this film and it\'s place within the Star Wars lure/canon. Instead of writing out all of the problems with this film, I will list them as I\'m sure you\'ve seen this film and have an idea of what I\'m talking about.<br><br>-Time: We\'re led to believe that this film takes place over a course of 12 or so hours while the First Order engages the Resistance in a OJ Simpsonesque - low speed chase. However multiple days pass while Rey is on the island with Luke. This film is supposed to pick up right after TFA. How is this possible?<br>- The unnecessary inclusion of Laura Dern\'s character. Who is she? Where did she come from? Star Wars is now relying on it\'s audience to read supplemental material instead of adding exposition in the film. This character in every way could have been played by Admiral Ackbar , a legendary character who deserved more than a briefly mentioned off screen death.<br><br>You know this movie is no good.

Being that "The Last Jedi" is the follow-up to the re-energizing "The Force Awakens," "The Last Jedi" is an extremely disappointing feature film. Whenever there is a bright moment in "The Last Jedi," the dialogue and directing choices always bring it back down to a sub-par level. "Revenge of the Sith" is a much stronger entry into the Star Wars universe, making "The Last Jedi" within the bottom three (3) as a live-action Star Wars entry. Furthermore, considering the dismantling of the beloved character that was Luke Skywalker, "The Last Jedi" is the most damaging to the Star Wars legacy and canon.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977048097/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/10156053548254721/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977048097/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> An insult to the fans, to the public, to everyone\'s intelligence.

This movie ruined Star Wars. I guess the Mickey Mouse in South Park is valid. Who cares what the fans like, we just want their money. Well, Star Wars is dead to me. There are no redeeming characters left, all the ones that survived have no substance. The reasons any of them exist as they are is laughable. Worst movie of all the Star Wars movies and I\'m content saying that this movie is not canon, the Luke Skywalker that was in the first movies still lives there. Mark Hamil tried to warn us. I hope all Star Wars fans boycott the next movie, maybe we can have some justice on how dirty this movie was by forcing them to make another reboot; Disney can take a page from Marvel-they own both companies after all.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977048069/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/1840814342608987/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977048069/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="10"></span></div> It\'s not a typical Star Wars movie. It doesn\'t give the fans anything that they expected or wanted out of a second installment to this trilogy. The director and producers were more interested in pushing an ideological/political agenda than in building characters and telling a good story. Very disappointed, and an opportunity to make Luke shine completely lost. I loved The Force Awakens, but after watching The Last Jedi I don\'t even care what happens in episode 9.</div> </div> </div>']
