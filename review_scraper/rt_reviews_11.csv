It\'s even worse than Attack of the Clones. Yes, really. <br><br>The movie itself is shot well and is visually fantastic. The sound effects and soundtrack are on point. That\'s basically all this movie has going for it. I literally only signed up for Rotten Tomatoes so I could review this movie. I am a life-long SW fan and own all of the movies, played basically all of the video games, and I have also read dozens of the books. I am a bit of a super fan you could say. <br><br>TLJ suffers from a number of problems. There are serious plot holes, plot elements which simply do not make sense, failed attempts at humor that come off as immersion-breaking rather than genuinely funny, and oh so much social/political pandering. Every woman in the movie is a strong, brave badass leader type and pretty much all of the men are bumbling idiots or totally evil. I don\'t care that the movie ran long, but what I do care about is that a lot of what is in the movie is utterly pointless and doesn\'t serve to further the plot. The character development in this film is basically non-existent. You learn absolutely nothing whatsoever about Snoke before he is killed. NOTHING! You learn nothing about Rey aside from the fact that her parents were poor nobodies, yet she is able to knock Jedi Master Luke Skywalker to the ground in a duel and master basically everything she attempts to do with virtually no training whatsoever. The existing Star Wars storyline before Disney bought Lucas out was fantastic and could have provided material for dozens of movies taking place after the original trilogy and even thousands of years before and everywhere inbetween. Disney rendered almost all of it non-canon and now we are left with a lukewarm bowl of poop soup. <br><br>I could go on and on and on detailing every stupid thing wrong with this movie but I am sure those points have been mentioned countless times by other reviewers. I\'ll sum it up like this:<br><br><br>PROS:<br>-great visuals<br>-great sound/soundtrack<br>-old school puppet Yoda<br>-some good battle scenes both in space and lightsaber duels<br><br><br>CONS:<br>-terrible character decisions make by Disney / Johnson<br>-weak dialogue<br>-no character development at all<br>-numerous inane plot holes<br>-pointless quests that people go on that just waste screen time<br>-sociopolitical pandering <br>-feminist agenda b.s. <br>-new uses of the Force never seen before that simply do not make sense<br>-some parts were very confusing and didn\'t make sense <br>-classic characters like R2D2, Chewbacca, C3PO, and others under-utilized<br>-unlikeable and/or annoying new characters (Rose in particular)</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="gdf f."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977053584/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> gdf f</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> - It has more plotholes than a swiss cheese.<br><br>-What they did with Luke\' character was the worst of the movie, defenitely not my Luke.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Eric W."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/976574572/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Eric W</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span>\xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="45"></span></div> I saw the last showing of THE LAST JEDI at my local theater before it was replaced this weekend one month after it\'s release. It\'s a small theater. <br>Everything STAR WARS about this film seems to be stripped down to its bare bones with a few basic plots developing as a primary and secondary nervous system, then the body is being rebuilt with the same genetic coding but due to different environmental factors the final entity is coming out looking quite different. It also seems due to the inclusion of the aging previous generation this film is growing out grey in its philosophy of the Force. <br>Failure and learning from failure seems to be what this movie\'s about. Characters make illogical choices, which turn to mistakes that must be dealt with. Some of the survivors learn from their errors. Coping with, and even accepting failure, is a tough story for the characters. Not everyone makes mistakes in the film. Some have mentors to guide them out of their failure. Rey\'s story arc is an organic exploration of the Light and the world around her, and the Dark and herself. <br>Tonal shifts, from seriousness to comedic, raging anger to laughter, emphasize the struggle for balance between the Light Side and the Dark Side. Some of the comedy is dark comedy. <br>Some character choices and revelations refreshingly clear the air of speculation. Of course I had my theories about a few things based on the previous seven episodes. For example Rey\'s parents. Rey as Luke\'s kid would\'ve been the obvious guess. My more radical guess, she was a clone of Anakin Skywalker with the Y chromosome changed to an X so she wouldn\'t be noticeable as an Anakin clone. But her origins are none of those. Not everyone important needs to be a prince or princess. Some people can rise to notoriety from nowhere. The direction the film does take, the galaxy feels open to the possibility that Force users could pop up from anywhere. <br>I also like how Kylo has chosen to be irredeemable. His mother, uncle, and Rey have given up on him. Even if he begs for forgiveness now in the IXth episode, they may not forgive him. When Hux found Kylo lying on the ground and reached inside his coat, was one of the best small actions in the film. <br>It has space combat, hand-to-hand combat, starships, alien worlds, alien creatures, the Force, and characterization. This fantasy/scifi space adventure is fun, moody, desperate, some thrills, and exciting. There\'s blatant and subtle uses of the Force. The Light and the Dark. What I take away from this episode is that decisions and consequences are unique to each character. The story also takes refreshing and unexpected turns, which help distinguish these characters and this episode. As much as they talk about hope, there\'re still only as many resistance fighters as can fit in the small freighter as they fly off in the end.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="David C."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977053580/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> David C</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="10"></span></div> Snoke ended up being a cookie cutter villain, and Kylo Ren is one the most underwhelming villains I\'ve ever seen.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="robertk23is"> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/964732538/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Robert K</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="10"></span></div> There is so much wrong with this movie it\'s hard to decide where to begin. So I\'ll just give a basically a list of my main complaints. The first half of this film is a bloated, disjointed mess that has minimal influence over the second half of the film. The main conflict of the first half moves at a snails pace, apparently to give enough time for an additional handful of subplots that ultimately go nowhere. Character decisions must have been made based off a roll of the dice instead of the situations presented in the story. The few crumbs of character growth are forced and not natural. There seemed to be a push to add as much humor as possible, which most of the jokes were out of place and fell flat. On top of being just a bad movie in general, it also wasn\'t a very satisfying star wars movie. It has very little regard for any star wars material preceding it ( including TFA). Characters don\'t behave as has been established, they don\'t use Star Wars "physics", OT characters are dispatched like they are in Game of Thrones. It doesn\'t even feel like a Star Wars movie. Which some may argue is a good thing but I can\'t agree that opinion. In summary this neither succeeded at being a good movie or an enjoyable Star Wars movie.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Allen C."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977053573/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Allen C</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="50"></span></div> Amazing film, saw it twice</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Dave W."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977053531/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Dave W</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> "This is not the Star Wars film you are looking for..."<br>"You can go about your business..."<br>"Move along..."</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977053524/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/1631738023539118/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977053524/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> You can pander to an audince and keep the plot you want.

Snoke was nothing more than a plot device with zero payoff to who he is, Rey\'s parents end up being nothing, Luke\'s death at the end is totally "wat," and it basically made every male in the movie into either a blundering idiot or a villain while every female was righteous, smart and valorous... I\'m all for equal male/female treatment but this was not equal at all. The story was filled with holes and totally broken. It had a few cool action sequences which were neat and some humor here and there but otherwise, a major disappointment. I would rate this one as being just as bad as Phantom Menace.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/806959122/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/543060802/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/806959122/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Tim S</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="30"></span></div> Absolutely NOT the disastrous mess people are making it out to be. While a little over-long (needs 15 mins trimmed off) it\'s still an unexpected and enjoyable film that even brought some emotions out of me from my Star Wars childhood.</div> </div> </div>']
