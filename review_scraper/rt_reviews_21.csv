If this movie had given a good explanation about Snoke, an actually good answer to Rey\'s parentage, not made Leia look super dumb, gave a moment of silence for Ackbar\'s death, and made Luke\'s death powerful and meaningful, and removed their Social Justice Warrior agenda, then the movie would be very satisfactory. Hopefully J.J. can help build back up this mess that Disney and Kathleen Kennedy gave us.

I came back to revise my review to address a few things.<br><br>People that do not like the movie, have in many abundant comments explained why they did not like it. This is coming from die hard fans AND! Casual movie viewers.<br><br>if you saw " The fan Awakens " ( a ok movie but a reboot in my opinion) you know the movie ended with Luke and rey on the Island...rey..tears in her eyes handing off the saber to Luke.... tears in her eyes.... Tears are gone when we see the same moment in "TLJ"<br><br>People that do not like the movie talk about plots holes, and nonsensical story ... here is one example of somethng gone terribly wrong, the movie is so full of errors it is almost impossible to ignore to try to watch and enjoy.<br><br>In " TFA " The rebelion has destroyed the starkiller base, Fin and Kylo are both very injured and the First order is trying to recover from a massive beating. <br><br>From the end of that movie...we advance into "TLJ " the rebelion is now on its last legs , no ships, no fuel....destitue with no support....down to handfull of ships and at the end down to less than 400 people...and no ships. All of this has happened ...apparently in a mater of A FEW days.<br><br>Kylo is almost fully healed ..inside a few days...same for Fin.... Anyone notice the time errors here... from the time Rey has gone to see Luke, and returned , we are given the impression this is days...not weeks not months. <br><br>This is one of many, many , many errors in the movie.<br><br>All of us that are fans know it was time to bring in new characters and new storyline.... but.... storys with a plot, with something that makes sense. <br><br>This movie makes no sense at all.<br><br>Thosands of people have taken to the internet to say why they did not like this movie. Young, old, black, white, red, yellow...green .... women, men have all voiced a deep loathing for this movie anmd where it is going.<br><br>I see a comment " Well ! Stupid butt hurt fan boys !! It is making money !! It must be okay !! " <br><br>Star wars has one of the largest fan base of all genres, 40 years in the making.... fans number in the hundreds of millions. try to find 1 person that has not seen 1 star wars movie. By sheer weight of numbers, the movie was going to make money. if only 10% of the fans fgo see the movie, that is likely the 1 billion dollar mark right there. And they will go, even if they hear the movie is bad, so they can ge see for themselves what a train wreck this.<br><br>But...the error, when you buy a brand, you do not 100% alter what it is. If you buy Mcdonalds Restaurants, and decide you are going to stop making hambugers and go totaly vegan...odds are yes, you will keep some of your clients...but you are going to lose 90% of the others. If you buy a brand, you do not fuck with your brand, you can make changes, and have new things but you do not change it at its corfe if you want to keep your client base. Marketing 101 basic.<br><br>Star wars is a brand, and disney has fucked with the brand with to many changes and to many errors and stupidity. So yes, it has made money, but it is a one time deal. The nex movie in this enstalment, many, many people will wait, to hear from friends if the movie totaly sucked, and they will hold off going and wait for the DVD or similar. There will be no more billion dollar paydays.<br><br>People that do not like this movie, us " butt hurt fan boys " .... yeah.. Anway we take the time to write out the million and 1 reason why this movie is so terrible, we are fair and we are honest. I see a lot of " Best movie ever 5 stars !!! " And with no other explantion.... Wow..seriously ? If you loved or liked this movie, for fuck sake... tell people point by point what you liked. <br><br>If all you can says is " best movie ! " " fresh and new love the new direction ! " Then do the decent thing and list all the wonderful things you see in this movie, where the vast majority of the rest of us do not. <br><br>The movie is a travesty to film making and story telling, and as a star wars movie is a complete non sensical mess, destroying all the previous characters and star wars lore. And basically saying to all the 40 years of star wars fans " Thanks...but we dont need you any more...Fuck off " <br><br>A horrid, nonsensical film, full of plot holes and idiotic humor, wait for the DVD</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/794191844/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/647757634/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/794191844/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Stepan K</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> Poor Mark Hamill, I hope he charges them by the second to be in this.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="roxkohlin"> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/958624216/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> R.

Apparently, there is a Han Solo movie coming out next year that sounds like it?s an absolute train wreck. so, let?s frame it like so; we just enduring this steaming pile of sh*t. Next year?s big follow up is a ham solo movie no one asked for (or cares about) that was so mismanaged, Disney brass had to recast the director (Ron Howard of all people ) to try and salvage what remains of this disaster movie. A year after that, we get to see...episode IX of this...trilogy. yay. Who is even going to be in this movie? They basically killed everybody off. More Rey and Ren? I think I?ll pass on all of these and you should probably do the same.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/955464591/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/1450607822/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/955464591/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Steve K</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="10"></span></div> Trash.

The Last Jedi is not only just the worst Star Wars movie in the franchise but it is just a bad movie in general. It comes across as a B-movie that whilst having great special effects, contains a storyline with no substance and dozens upon dozens of plot holes. There are literally hundreds of videos on YouTube that go through all these plot holes so I\'m not going to rehash them here. Suffice it to say that this film spectacularly manages to not only destroy the course of its own trilogy but of those that came before it. It\'s a complete betrayal to Star Wars fans insulting both their intelligence and essentially disrespecting them on many levels. The Star Wars Xmas Special was better as at least it had a feel good factor. <br>I\'m giving it a half star just because of Mark Hamill\'s performance (otherwise it would get zero) who despite the total evisceration of his character Luke Skywalker, played this altered ego with utter professionalism. I was genuinely excited when it was first announced that the late Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill would be reprising their roles but the way they have been depicted in this new trilogy has just been very disappointing. Disney said that each movie was to be a story about each of the OT characters - err no - it\'s a method to kill each one in turn whilst extracting cash from mislead audiences. "Let the past die, kill it if you have to" - well no actually that\'s such a dumb philosophy. Are blockbuster movie writers so weak nowadays that they can\'t interweave characterisation\'s and storylines with both new and old characters. Ask yourself - just why exactly do the original characters need to die? To make room for new ones and for the story to progress is nonsensical. I used to be so excited about hearing about new Star Wars movies (Rogue One was excellently done). Look where we are now - the whole of the resistance basically fits into the Millennium Falcon which according to Wookiepedia suggests a max capacity of about 16. In a galaxy of trillions of sentient beings, billions of planets and thousands of massive space armadas we\'re left with a resistance band who can fit into my front living room. Episode 8 tells us a story about one of most powerful Jedi that the galaxy has ever known bested by a girl with absolutely no training and then later on fades into nothing because he\'s depressed. A man who left a map for people to find him because he doesn\'t want to found. Really? This is the best you could come up with? I really don\'t see what there is to look forward to in Episode 9 and beyond.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977051230/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/170244193706707/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977051230/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span>\xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="45"></span></div> Great acting, many suprises and incredible cinematography.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Lance A."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/976996337/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Lance A</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> This all falls at the feet of Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson. Rian Johnson is a joke. This shabby excuse for a story doesn\'t go anywhere. None of the characters were consequential and none of the stakes were real. NOTHING MATTERED in this film. TLJ was a nihilistic example of all glitz and glamor with zero substance. Rian Johnson in one foul swoop not only undermined The Force Awakens but literally delegitimized the most important protagonist of the original trilogy... LUKE SKYWALKER! What the hell were you people thinking allowing the hack who created "Looper" to make a Star Wars film? I\'m done with Star Wars as long as Kathleen Kennedy is in charge. I refuse to see another film and I refuse to buy any more merchandise. You\'ve ruined Star Wars. You BROKE a no brainer franchise!

I enjoyed this film and thought Rian came with fresh ideas and huge potential. There has never been a more action packed Star Wars save for RoTS. TFA was an incredible film, however it was a rehash of the original which was its biggest flaw. Rian came to do something completely different and to open up Star Wars by combining old Star Wars characters and known places with new places and ledgends based material which is great to see being used. This film is being panned because it doesn\'t adhere to typical Star Wars, yet it would be being personally I\'d give this a clear 4slated if it was a r same people. This film deserves far more credit than it has been given by the fans, I enjoyed it and hold it as one of my favourite in the series. I didn\'t think it was a good idea to bring back JJ for IX before I went to see TLJ but now I feel he is the right person to bro g in and complete his story. As he was the principle creator of the characters. I think when episode IX comes out people will appreciate this film more as it may make more sense to the people who just don\'t seem to get what Rian was going for, or the people who genuinely just didn\'t like it. But it doesn\'t deserve 49%. I\'d say it deserves a clean 85% .</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/798755568/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/1414140237/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/798755568/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Nick S</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> Bad Writing, riddled with plot holes, dropped subplots from the force awakens. Took characters in directions that made no sense with other continuity in star wars cannon. Very busy movie with too many plot lines that tied together very poorly. Special effects were astounding and actors gave the best performances they could with the script as bad as it was. Two thumbs up to the special effects team and the acting staff. Lost opportunity overall. Shame.</div> </div> </div>']
