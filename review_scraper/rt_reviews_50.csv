Clearly they\'re being paid for ratings.<br><br>If Kathleen Kennedy still has a job after this, I\'ll be amazed. And if Rian Johnson gets handed the keys to a full trilogy of his own then Disney execs must be smoking something insane. I won\'t say don\'t see it because people will go see it naturally. But when the next one bombs they shouldn\'t blame JJ, or whoever does it. It\'ll be this movie that did it and no amount of box-office figures argument will be able to hide this movie\'s terrible failure.<br><br>Quick message to JJ Abrams. Don\'t do it mate. It\'s a trap. Step back and leave it to some other idiot. It might be savable on an individual movie basis. But this trilogy is down the pan and the best that could happen now is the last movie is decent as a stand alone and I\'m not sure why any director would want to be associated with it.<br><br>Also the reason they didn\'t put "I have a bad feeling about this" in the movie must have been because a lot of us had that before t came out.

If you don\'t like it and think it\'s not supposed to be in the saga then your wrong if you watched every movie and every episode for every show (except for the holiday special) and if you have read every book (including comics) than you would like the movie and you would understand how it can go with the story. If you think you can do better have at it write your own script and tell them to make the movie for you that way we can prove that they did a good job. So don\'t say something bad about something and than try to do better, because what you do is worse than what they already did. And one last thing Th name the last jedi means that look was the last jedi rey never believed in the religion and all of his students were killed by kylo ren and that doesn\'t make kylo ren a jedi cause he doesn\'t believe in the religion anymore after luke tried to kill him, and don\'t try to make any excuse to say that the movie didn\'t go with the story because of what ever cause I\'ll come right back and tell you how that goes with the story.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Sean%20 L."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977046453/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Sean%20 L</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/rating/ni.png"> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="ni"></span></div> Eh, for a movie being praised for its "risks" it sure took things safe, some scenes were fantastic enough to warrant this rating, but all in all it was...</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Ned Star"> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/976950115/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Ned S</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> This shite is NOT Star Wars!!</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Neil C."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/976790428/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Neil C</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="30"></span></div> A for effort, D- for execution.
