It\'s an agenda movie, written and directed with the sole purpose of literally changing everything and attacking every criticism of TFA and Star Wars in general in order to appeal to critics. TFA copied Ep4? This copies 5 and 6 together while changing eveything solely for that purpose even though it it breaks story logic and character motivation. It truly is a broken movie that achieves critical success by taking a red marker to the concepts that "modern audiences" find quaint about the originals, focusing bluntly on current affairs politics and presenting it under the star Wars banner; what Lucas originally created "a story of good versus evil for 12 year old boys" and Disney uses as a 2.5 hour toy commercial.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977053340/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/882332228594280/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977053340/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> This movie put the nail in the coffin for this franchise, disney only want to make money and not do fan service to star war fans.<br><br>The public have to stop falling for this, and supporting these overhyped star war fans that are not good at all</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/808706521/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/650171847/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/808706521/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Branko V</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> This movie is a blasphemy. it lacks logic, has boring and unnecesary parts, out of place humor, irritant characters, best musical bits are right-out quotations from the original, and dramatic structure that was handled so well byoriginal movie is completely absent.

Only a shadow of this character is left in The Last Jedi. Instead we see a grumpy and angry old man who wants our new hero Rey to leave him alone. Fine so far, if this changes over the course of this movie, but nope, that is the Luke&amp;Rey dynamic in this whole movie. No emotional and personal bonding. We learn what happened between Luke and Ben (his nephew) and in this Luke entered with an ignited weapon the room of his nephew because he sensed some darkness and had for an blink of an eye the idea to kill him. Yes, just throw the whole original Lucas trilogy out of the window for this. I call this lazy writing to make Kylo look better and a character assassination.<br><br>So we can follow Rey, who should then be the eyes of the audience? Nope, she acts stupid and listens to evil Kylo, despite that this guy tortured her in the last movie and killed and injured her best friends. Rey also needs no training and like in the last movie, she just lest the force in and can do everything without training. Luke does not really train her and instead tells he why the Jedi should end and why he came to the island to die. Another big failure. Rey and Luke even fight and of course the Jedi master Luke is beaten by a not trained Rey...what a surprise.<br><br>We come to another big issue of this movie the slapstick Marvel humor entering Star Wars. Poe making a prank call to Hux, Hux ridiculed by Snoke in front of the other First Order soldiers. Then we saw some of Luke\'s daily life and I wish I could get the scene out of my head with Luke milking this big pace creature for green milk. We also got a scene in which Luke wants to burn the temple tree after Rey was gone, but cannot do it and then Yoda appears and shows him that he did not learn anything in 30 years, because Yoda is still the master and force lightning style burns the tree.<br><br>We also have some other characters in this movie like Finn and newbie Rose, but who cares, because the plot does not care and her casino planet mission was useless and failed in the end. It was only there to have them something to do. The plot of Poe and Holdo as both competitors for military leadership was again a sign of bad writing and Holdo simply telling Poe about the rescue plan would have saved us the usleless Finn&amp;Rose mission. <br><br>The last appearance of Luke, after no one else came for rescue was another rollercoaster of bad writing, bad execution and simply bad directing. It starts with a nice goodbye scene between Luke&amp;Leia and so we expect a showdown between Luke and Kylo. Yes, the First Order shoots everything at Luke, but we already wonder where did Luke get his hair cut and dyed + bis beard trimmed on the way to this final confrontation, but whatever. It looked exciting first, also when Kylo finally ignited his saber to battle Luke, but then we learn Luke is just a force projection. We see him meditating on his island while crating the projection....impressive, but wait...the next second he falls down on his meditating rock, crawls back and with pain in his face fades away. So Luke Skywalker dies and this was it what he achieved = nothing, only a handful of rebels escaped in one ship! Of course we saw wonder Rey at the end levitating rocks and helped them escaping, but is this enough together with broom force boy to bring me back into cinema for episode IX? Nope, that was it for me after over 30 years sadly!!!</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Chiki%20 C."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977053252/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Chiki%20 C</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> Worst piece of garbage ever seen this movie makes attack of the clones a god like movie</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/937073597/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/760754971/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/937073597/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Edgar M</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span>\xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="25"></span></div> Too long and with many holes.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/887600260/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/1287633662/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/887600260/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Rc G</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="40"></span></div> Not perfect, but fun and entertaining</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="James T."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977053215/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> James T</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span>\xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="45"></span></div> **SPOILER FREE REVIEW**<br>I have now seen this film three times: with my younger brothers (11 &amp; 14), with my parents (late 40s) and with my girlfriend (21). All of us loved it and it got better every viewing. The action was exciting, the cinematography was beautiful, the humour was funny (a lot of complaints about this, I didn\'t find it to be the case at all), and the story continued the journey well.<br><br>Many complaints are about Luke\'s character, I found him to be engaging, more so than the original trilogy in which he was relatively boring character-wise. He is different, but why is that a surprise considering all that has happened? All of the characters have been progressed and enriched by this film. The plot holes are easily explained and are no more significant than in any of the other films.<br><br>To conclude, The Last Jedi was a thrilling ride from beginning to end, moving the Star Wars universe forward in an unexpected, but necessary, direction. Everyone I\'ve spoken to loved it, don\'t dwell too much on internet opinions. One minor qualm is that a subplot was extended dragged on slightly, but aside from that, it was great.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/976948850/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/1833989309977112/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/976948850/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> This movie should be removed from Star Wars cannon!

Nobody could seriously put their reputation as a critic at such risk and say this is a good film. Did I read the title wrong? Was this actually a new Spaceballs film? Did Luke really milk that big breasted ocean monster? Did Chewy actually have a novelty fake rubber chicken on a skewer and Penguin owls manning the M Falcon? Hans would be shitting in his grave. I didn\'t know whether to laugh or cry so I shat myself too. I think they then used that to write and make the rest of the film while I went out to buy some \xa310 popcorn. WTF were those strange frog creatures on Lukes island? The offspring of Toad of Toad Hall and Mother Teresa. Yoda - what a disgrace. Luke - Bigger let down to the Jedi than this film was to the franchise. Rose - Glad you died. Snoke - Voldermort\'s now branching out. Kylo - What a lame sulky teenager. Needs a good spanking and bed without dinner. Rey - About the only thing that holds this shit together. Going to send Disney my newborns 200 shitty nappies as ideas for the next film. Perhaps they can make even more of a joke of it. I will still go see it though, just like everyone else.

In this case, the story was just okay. It\'s wierdly paced, and Finn and Rose\'s story ends up being a total waste of time. That whole bit added an extra half-hour that could have been used for something better (or taken out entirely).<br><br>Another buzzword people like using is the word "plothole," which is really obnoxious to have to see used incorrectly every three sentences when reading through these already terrible and egregiously misinformed audience reviews. People seem to think a plothole is "a thing that didn\'t make sense to me, or a small bit of minutiae that doesn\'t add up with something else but has no affect on the story as a whole." <br><br>In real life, a "Plot Hole" is, in plain English, a loose end that is never tied up by the end of the film, or in this case, trilogy of films. The Last Jedi, as far as I can remember, doesn\'t contain any. <br><br>As for the stupid political argument...<br><br>Star Wars has always been left-leaning. There\'s no getting around that. It\'s always been about taking down a fascist institution. That\'s as left-leaning as you can get. But, strangely, people act like the political angle of Star Wars is somehow...a new thing? But it\'s not the actual political element of the Story that people focus on. Oh no, the part that theyre focusing on is the fact that the three protagonists are a white woman, a black man, and a Latino man, instead of two white men and a white woman. They will deny that this is the problem, saying that it is instead the fact that "they are thrown in" or "there\'s no good reason for it." <br><br>Guaranteed, the people saying these things are white men who don\'t like seeing women and people of color in positions of power, and upon seeing it will denounce it as "pandering to liberals" despite the fact that Star Wars, from the beginning, has been a condemnation of far conservative ideals.<br><br>As it stands, The Last Jedi is nowhere close to being the best Star Wars movie. It\'s a reasonably satisfying Star Wars movie. It\'s about as good as Return of the Jedi. <br><br>If you dislike this movie because of the wierd pacing, or how most things that happen end up being totally ineffectual, then fair game, that\'s perfectly valid. Those are actual issues. But if you don\'t like it because it\'s "SJW bullshit" or whatever madness is going on inside your head then kindly fuck off.</div> </div> </div>']
