I gave it one star out five. <br><br> Disney has found their greatest platform upon to stand and wave their banner of leftist, feminism rich, anti-everything masculine and anything to do with the true story of Star Wars. <br> Ryan Johnson is a yes man to the true villian of the galaxy in Kathleen Kennedy and was rewarded for his destruction of the franchise with a new trilogy for his loyalty and his deplorable script and nothing short of a parody that slaps Star Wars fans in the face. <br> Ryan Johnson you are no friend of Star Wars and no friend to the Star Wars fan base. It is clear and undeniable, in my opinion, that little Ryan was tasked with destroying the film, the story, potentially the franchise and did so with extreme predjudice. <br> The franchise is dead in the hands of Disney as far as I\'m concerned. It would take two more films minimum written and directed by Gareth Edwards with no interference, rewrites, and reshoots to put this scattered story back together and put the WAR back into Star Wars and squeeze the story free of every last drop of the political venom that little Ryan and his momma (Kennedy) has had injected into and poisoned the story and soured the most dedicated fans.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/806898256/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/512105127/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/806898256/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Lego S</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> 5 females, all better, bigger, and stronger than Luke Skywalker. <br>30 minute subplot of the characters getting a "parking ticket" that leads them to "stick it to the rich white man" while saving all the animals. <br><br>Absolutely ridiculous film.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="pablo M."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977052509/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> pablo M</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span>\xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="15"></span></div> This is the film that killed Star Wars.

I enjoy eating it but that does not mean is good nor healthy to eat it. Is this what we are suposed to expect from the Disney cinema experience? From big budget movies? Not worth the money. <br><br>Regarding the Hero\xb4s Journey, this movie fails every single aspect of it and that is why people won\xb4t care for it. The hype won\xb4t last more than a few months. Pure marketing stunt based on nostalgia and special effects.<br><br>I liked the movie but I also like Macdonalds (specially after so much time without having it ) but even so... after 30 minutes you are hungry again... it does not fulfill you, because it does not have real nutrients. Our pleasure comes from nostalgia alone.<br><br>Star Wars went from universal themes and an epic mythological story to politics and fake feminism. <br><br>If what you like is action, special effects and cheap comedy than this is the movie for you.<br><br>Kathleen Kennedy pissed on the fan base, Mark Hamill and the entire world with her distorted view on feminism. For the love of God fire this woman!<br><br>Clearly this is a producer film and not an art film. Money is the name of this game and artistic integrity is thrown out the window. I simply cannot believe Rian was in control of this movie.<br><br>My major complaints: ( SPOILER WARNING )<br><br>Did Luke hit Yoda when Yoda refused to train him? Is that what feminism is all about? Women beating men? Telling men what to do? Isn\xb4t the master\xb4s choice of whom he is willing to teach? Physicaly beating your own teacher because you disagree makes you surpass him? I sense the Dark Side in this movie.<br><br>I support real feminism by the way and Mary Sues are the antithesis of feminism. Just to name a few, here are some great female fictional characters:<br><br>Ellen - Gone with the Wind<br>Ripley - Alien franchise<br>Elizabeth - Pride and Prejudice<br>Sarah Connor - Terminator<br>Imperator Furiosa - Madmax Fury Road<br>Alice in Wonderland<br>Wonder Woman - 2017<br>Beauty and the Beast - 2017<br>Pocahontas<br>Tombraider<br>Princess Leia<br>Mary Poppins<br>Princes Fiona - Shrek<br>etc, etc<br><br>Kylo Ren: Space Columbine Emo. There isn\'t much else to say about it.<br><br>Rey ( Mary Sue or Space Jesus ):<br><br>Independent woman who lives by herself in a dessert planet<br>No parenting needed (how was she brought up as a scavenger? Force Awakens is also included in this list)<br>No friends arround<br>Professional scavenger<br>Can fight 2 men easily with no help required<br>Speaks fluent Robot<br>Speaks fluent Wookie<br>Knows how to pilot a ship .<br>Knows mechanic more than Han and Chewie<br>Knows how to use the Force WITHOUT ANY TRAINNING.<br>Instant best friends with ALL OF THE CHARACTERS including Kylo and Snoke (everybody likes her instantly)<br>Knows how to use a lightsaber<br>Beats Kylo Ren in a physical fight<br>Beats Kylo Ren in a moral fight<br>Is disrespectful to Luke<br>Beats Luke in a physical fight<br>Beats Luke in a moral fight<br>Beats Snoke guards <br>Gives orders to Chewbacca<br>Gets to keep the millenium falcon ( #wookielivesmatter guys )<br>Yoda kisses her ass for no reason<br>Knows everything that was on the sacrate Jedi books ( THAT SHE JUST FOUND OUT ABOUT IT ) .<br>No temptation to go to the Dark Side<br>Loves a Space Columbine Emo <br>All of this abilities except that she is extremely fragile, naive and imature.... THAT DOESN\'T MAKE ANY SENSE !!!<br><br>Actually, come to think of it... even Jesus had temptations and moments of despair... She is the worst character ever created.<br><br>------------------------------------<br><br>Fin: The only one following the Hero\xb4s Journey is put aside as a secondary character... a black man as a comic relief ? How original ! Waysted character (should be main lead) .<br><br>Poe: How a stupid feminist (not all of them are ) sees all straight man. Arrogant, impulsive, stupid and way over his head. <br><br>Holdo: Arrogant feminist textbook. If there wasn\xb4t an archetype for arrogant feminism, now there is.<br><br>Rose: "Save what you love". Fuck the resistance I guess.<br><br>Rian Johnson: To be fair, JJ gave him a mess to follow up. How to make Rey interesting if she was a Mary Sue? How to make Kylo interesting if he was a space Emo? He didn\'t have much to work with. Both directors lacked balls to face Kathleen Kennedy and her capitalist and political agenda. Anyways, ALL of them are making tons of money... so FUCK THEM and their excuses!!! This movie is the new Batman and Robin. My only hope is that Disney will come arround and reboot the series Christopher Nolan\'s style. Before its too late.<br><br>Kathleen Kennedy\xb4s expectation: "Ok, so on episode 7 we make them wonder about the origins of several stuff in the movie and then on episode 8 we just throw these questions out the window, don\xb4t answer any of it and say it\xb4s time to let go of the past... brilliant! "<br><br>Chewbacca: Rey\'s employee and barbeque man.<br><br>Leia: Space Mary Poppins<br><br>Luke: winning bitter old fart.<br><br>5 minutes training and then she gives Luke a moral lesson and beats a FULLY TRAINED JEDI. If you think that time fades training then I sugest you go to a 70 year old black belt martial arts teacher and see how well you do in a fight... trust me you are going to get your ass kicked.<br><br>Kathleen Kennedy and The Power of Marketing <br><br>or<br><br>Kathleen Kennedy and the Power of Fake Feminism.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Bruno z."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977052463/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Bruno z</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="10"></span></div> I want to say that I never experienced this horrible feeling I had in the theater. It was crowded and it appears as if the air was sucked up, in a bad way off course. Very hard to explain but the tension in the air really showed that was not me really having a hard time with what we are seeing. No laughs, no excitement, only the terrible silence of people trying to hide themselves in the chairs.<br><br>I will say very briefly that not only it was not what fans expected, but rather is an important sign that we are tired of Hollywood and Media pushing modern agendas and dramas into what was supposed to be a Classic fantasy adventure, with heroes and villains that for generations populated our imaginations and inspired us. Instead they are forcing more \'modern\' narratives, where things are not light or dark but in between (grey). The problem here is that Star Wars was never that place and even if was the case could be better done, not going so far from its roots.<br><br>The future of Star Wars is very uncertain now that Disney really showed its cards and what to expect in the future. They are getting rid of the \'old stuff\' to have more room to expand, and doing so killing all the adventure that made the franchise so appealing. <br><br>This trilogy is pointless and will ruin the future of the Saga. It does not have heart, its root is not good enough to grow something worth. At this point I am afraid I am not interested anymore and many will feel the same. A shame in a so rich world.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977052481/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/1515236228583427/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977052481/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> Well, this is the way to kill what seemed to be an immortal saga.</div> </div> </div>']
