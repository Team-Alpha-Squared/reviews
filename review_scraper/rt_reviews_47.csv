Despite what many others thought, I loved The Force Awakens and if nothing else, it left most people with a bit of curiosity and maybe, optimism. I love Rey and I feel her arc was hurt by Finn and Rose\'s Candle Bight side story. Rather than expanding the depth of the characters we had been introduced to in Episode 7, more characters, multicultural and female were thrown at us simply to dodge the ridicule of our current society. Meanwhile, Admiral Ackbar was blown up into the dismal abyss of space and only mentioned once after... I feel this was a tip off of what TLJ planned to do to the Star Wars Universe as a whole, at least Luke went out with a bit more dignity... not much but a little. All of the males in this film were either written to be chauvinistic blow hards (i.e. Poe, what were they thinking? This is not the same guy we met in Episode 7) or they were killed off. I was all for the girl power but not this way, not at the expense of the male characters we have always loved or at the expense of the franchise itself. <br><br>The R2-D2 scene with Luke, the Porgs and the fact that this was Carrie Fisher\'s last appearance in a Star Wars film are the primary reason my rating is 2 stars and not 1.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Ynnek F."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977046894/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Ynnek F</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> Awful, awful, awful!

This is proof that the rating system at RT is completely rigged. I saw this film opening night and many weeks later, I\'m still angry about it. Rian Johnson, Kathleen Kennedy, and the whole gang at Disney completely destroyed the Star Wars saga with TLJ. The plot was full of holes. Apparently, there is gravity in space and Leia is now Superman. Luke is an angry as*hole who would rather hide in solitude, sucking space cow milk and spear fishing than helping his sister and the rebellion. btw - why wouldn\'t Luke just lift the fish out of the water using the force than jumping across a canyon with a huge spear? Also, now the force can be used to survive space, control lightning, and project yourself across a galaxy. If this was true, why wouldn\'t Luke, Obi-Wan, or Yoda project themselves behind the Emperor / Snoke and strike them down with lightning? What a ridiculous farce. The entire movie sucked as* and the creative team (**points finger at Rian Johnson**) should be ashamed of this film. Absolutely the worst PC piece of crap I\'ve ever seen in my life. Horrible as a Star Wars movie, even worse if it was a stand alone film. Also, don\'t get me started about Rose Rose Binks. All characters and story lines destroyed from the entertaining TFA. I can\'t imagine how JJ Abrams and George Lucas could praise this garbage. JJ Abrams is now tasked with finding a way to ignore this mess and build something decent from the rubble. As for me, this is the last SW movie I will pay to see in theatres. I loved Rogue One and liked TFA, but hated TLJ.

Every major character arc and loose thread from Force Awakens is either ignored or destroyed entirely. Every beloved character is brushed aside or unceremoniously discarded. What\'s left behind is an often awkwardly-funny, shallow shell of a star wars movie that feels overlong, and often times takes us down unnecessary paths. Little respect was given to star wars lore here and with the mantra "everything old must die" - what its replaced with doesn\'t instill much excitment for the future of the series. JJ Abrams has a lot of work to do if he wants to save this trilogy.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Ted S."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/976954820/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Ted S</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> It definitely kills the past... and present and future for that matter.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Jorge L."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977046840/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Jorge L</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> @rianjohnson Luke afraid? Are you serious? Who are you talking about, man? Left his home planet in a unknown quest to save a princess, Face the death star without a computer guidance, Travel to Dagoba to an uncertain world and an unknown master, Left his training to rescue his friends risking his life, Give himself to the enemy to save his friends\' plans in Endor, Face Emperor and Darth Vader already knowing that he was the last jedi and that no one will come to support him AND forgive his father\'s life, throw his light saber and confront the Emperor.<br>So you tried to tell us that THIS LUKE that we have loved for years is afraid? Of what? For heaven\'s sake? As his father before him who was created by midoclorians out of nothing, Luke has been created out of hard and plain courage. <br>That\'s Luke and I don\'t know what saga you have been fan of until today.<br>And beyond any criticism @hamillhimself you are a hell of an actor, I have no words to express my gratitude to you. How professional you had to be to let die in your performance such a great character knowing that it was the wrong way from any point of view, and yet I think that the last and final tribute to this character was your impressive performance that overcome an insipid final scene.<br><br>1. Es una buena y divertida pel\xedcula? Si, si lo es y debo a\xf1adir que he visto excelentes actuaciones m\xe1s all\xe1 de los errores de la trama y la direcci\xf3n. Es una pena que se haya desperdiciado tanto talento al servicio de un arco argumental tan pobre.<br>2. Es una buena adici\xf3n a la saga STAR WARS. No<br>3. Tienen muchos vac\xedos en su historia<br>4. Abusa del mismo recurso argumental de que les queda poco tiempo para algo<br>5. La salida a algunas situaciones es sosa y muchas veces sin l\xf3gica <br>6. Resolvieron situaciones de The Force Awakens de forma infantil y dejando el apetito de los fans en el aire. Quien era Snoke, la forma en que sale de la historia es menos que rid\xedcula (en serio?) y Quienes eran los padres de Rey?<br>7. Entiendo que la pel\xedcula no ser\xeda sobre las viejas glorias pero ver como Han Solo fue sabiamente despedido en The Force Awakens me dio esperanzas y ansiedad por ver como tratan la salida de personajes con mayor relevancia como Luke y Leia. Sin embargo la salida de Luke ha sido un fiasco y sabiendo que Carrie Fisher no podr\xe1 encarnar nuevamente a Leia en la siguiente entrega me hace suponer que su salida no sera mejor.<br>8. Tal como dejaron las cosas debo decir con tristeza que seguramente ir\xe9 a ver la siguiente pel\xedcula solo para ver so pueden resolver todos los vac\xedos y plantear algo que me permita reengancharme con la saga<br><br>The Star Wars Saga is dead, long live the The Star Wars Saga!</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Claire R."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977046823/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Claire R</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="10"></span></div> Last Jedi is the Last Star Wars film I will ever see.
