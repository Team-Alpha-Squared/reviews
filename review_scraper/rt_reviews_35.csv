However, if he hadn\'t done so, the Resistance would have been destroyed by the dreadnaught when it came out of light speed. The movie goes out of the way to put Poe in his place, but never acknowledges the simple truth that his decisive action prevented the complete annihilation of the Resistance.<br>2). Leia uses the Force. Somehow Leia can use the force to save herself from the void and vacuum of space, but can\'t be bothered to use the Force to save anybody else. Selfish . . . but just goes to show that you can drop "princess\' but not the privilege.<br>3). Leia must be a military awful leader, but she is portrayed with high esteem. It appears the Resistance suffers nothing but losses under her command. The only real major victory against the First Order was the doing of Han Solo. Notice that the rest of the galaxy can\'t be bothered to respond the Resistance call to fight (even with her portentous insistence that the communication be sent with her personal code). This shows you what the Galaxy actually thinks of Leia.<br>4) The escape plan is nonsense. You really have to go out of you way to add some silly elements to make this plausible, like the First Order wouldn\'t just immediately destroy the Resistance fleet coming out of the light speed or introducing "cloaking" (are these transports Birds of Prey from Star Trek?). Plus, the escape plan is to paint yourself into a corner in an old, defunct base? And just to rehash Leia\'s ability to use to Force, she is literally just sitting around while the base is under attack (waiting for somebody to come the rescue)-wouldn\'t it be a good time to demonstrate some of that force ability?<br>5) Final Jump to light speed: I guess we are just supposed to ignore all the discussions of running out of energy, and the ship running of fumes. <br>I won\'t go too far into a helpless Rey being choked out, and needing to be saved by Kylo Ren.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/913208906/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/1781995456/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/913208906/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Rudy V</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span>\xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 12, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="15"></span></div> I watched this, not as a zealot of Star Wars but as a fan of story telling, and on this and this alone, it was completely disappointing. Characterization, overall plotting, and structure was so weak it was distracting. Huge parts of the story could have been edited out. Characters are not connecting, and simple pseudo-science logic is thrown out of the window. On the plus side, this was beautiful to look at and some of the fight scene choreography was a treat. That alone is not enough, when other studios are delivering on more than just visual effects and sound design.

The Force Awakens (2015) was a brilliant revival to the series and set up the last Jedi amazingly with questions like who were Reys parents? and who was the supreme leader snoke?<br>In the last Jedi we find out Reys parents are junkers and snoke just dies. We also find that General Leia can LITERALLY SURVIVE IN SPACE. There are so many plotholes and dumb mistakes in this film that it is honestly not funny. HOW THE DUCK IS THERE GRAVITY IN SPACE RIAN JOHNSON YOU TRUCKING IDIOT. <br>Another irritating thing about what Rian Johnson has done with this film is ignore ALL THE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT in the original trilogy. Luke who spent episodes 4, 5 and 6 trying to REDEEM Darth Vader who literally killed countless innocent people would not simply try to KILL Kylo Ren just because he saw "the future" of his own student. Another thing which really annoys me about how Disney have handled the character of Luke is how they eventually killed him off. I\'m not disappointed in the decision to kill Luke off (I even called that it should be done in Last Jedi) but the downright stupidity of the way they did it. Right before Luke stopped his Aberration against Kylo on the planet Crait, he says "see you around kid" then LITERALLY IN THE NEXT SHOT HE KEELS OVER AND DIES ON THE ISLAND FOR NO REASON AT ALL.<br><br>Those are just some of the things that are in the film which will have you begging for Jar Jar to return. Oh and I almost forgot, if you thought Rey never being trained in the Force before but nevertheless beating luke in a duel before was bonkers the ending scene of The Last Jedi shows a 4 year old slave boy SUMMONING A BROOM WITH THE FORCE. Yep there you have it, anyone can now be as powerful as Darth trucking Vader.

This movie is an incoherent mess. I understand that Disney is waving away the public criticism as bot driven hating. What a crock. Its a turkey (so I suppose its good that it arrived in time for Christmas). One can only hope that JJ (when he comes back to the franchise), can un-turkey the whole shebang. A tall order I think, but possibly do-able. I guess we can\'t have Kylo wake up in the shower like Booby Ewing, and realise the whole thing was a bad dream. The truth will be bourne out of how many people purchase the blu-rays/DVDs or rewatch via the streaming services. When those numbers come in... you\'ll know if it was as good as its being cracked up to be... but from where I\'m sitting...

I couldn?t be happier with the film nor the performances in it. I?m looking forward to more of Johnson?s work related to the franchise.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977048722/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/10209769214699863/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977048722/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 12, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="10"></span></div> It totally destroyed everything Lucas was building all these years.
