The character that intrigues me the most, and who is the reason my interest in Star Wars has not only continued but grown, is Kylo Ren. I wasn\'t sure what to think of him in TFA; I felt disgust and horror at his actions and immaturity, but also reluctant admiration for his strength and stamina. That\'s one powerful, messed up guy, and as a writer, I\'m simply fascinated by his character development. I\'ve seen TLJ four times in theatres--unprecedented for me--so that I can watch the interactions between him and Rey; I swear every time I notice more nuances in his expression and demeanor that have me rethinking his motivations. He seems to wear his emotions on his sleeve, yet I\'m never convinced I know exactly what he\'s thinking. Rey, on the other hand, is as easy to read as a large-print book, but that suits the character. All of the performances were great, but in my opinion, Adam Driver is exceptionally talented.<br><br>What I could have done without in this movie is everything to do with the Finn and Rose storyline. I don\'t care that much about Finn as a character (I was okay with what he wanted to do at the end), and though I do like Rose, I was so engrossed in the rest of the story that I was impatient for their irrelevant scenes to end. I know which chapters on the bluray I\'ll be skipping--and I know which ones I\'ll play on repeat. <br><br>I liked Poe more this time around, liked BB-8 less, wanted to stand up and cheer for Holdo, wanted to smack Luke upside the head (with affection, like Gibbs), and I\'m still torn as far as Leia\'s concerned. On one hand, I\'m saddened and disappointed that she wasn\'t the mother Ben needed, and on the other, I sympathize with and have respect for the strong woman who survived so many trials and tribulations. I mean, no one can do it all, and it\'s interesting that she\'s a better general than mother (which is debatable, considering how much ground the Resistance has lost). Usually it\'s fathers who take that stance. I cannot imagine what they\'ll do with her character in IX without Carrie Fisher (R.I.P.).<br><br>I\'m very excited for the next episode; I would much rather see IX this year than the Han Solo movie.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="mwinkler7"> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/971731164/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Matt W</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="40"></span></div> Lol at all these people not getting their perfect Star Wars film.

No real plot twists and plot all together was bad. Killing off Snoke right away??? Looked like they were going to expand on the force and didn\'t. What was that part when she was in the pit..no explanation. Also Kylo goes from not being sure if he\'s good or bad to being bad and killing all the other students? That made no sense. Everything was kind of rushed through. No good character development at all. Lukes acting was average. I didn\'t mind how he died at all and actually thought it was one of the few bright spots his final fight. Just nowhere near the force awakens. I guess because all the summer movies sucked Hollywood is grasping at straws. Effects were decent.. I love the guy who says if you don\'t like the movie we don\'t like diversity so now this is a diversity thing hahah oh man. Great way to rate a movie. Bottom line Johnson is not a good director at all. Bring back Force Awakens director!!</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/916813256/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/1551555214/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/916813256/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Fajri W</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> bad movie, he kills luke character, bad jokes,</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/937010014/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/100003683638320/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/937010014/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Simon H</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> This movie will go down in cinematic history as the best/worst example of what not to do with a middle film in a trilogy of movies with established series/lore.<br><br>Despite the fact this movie is visually stunning and sounds amazing the story was depressingly dull with no world building, no arc, no tension giving us characters<br>unbelievably stupid (especially if they were male) <br>with cringe inducing comedy moments that systematically trashed any chance of drama. <br><br>The movie systematically either ruined or ignored all of the interesting questions and mysteries of the TFA and criminally shoe horned politics into the narrative at the expense of <br>story at every given opportunity.<br><br>Rian Johnson took a giant dump on this franchise and I am astonished Disney let this slide.

(SPOILERS AHEAD)<br><br>To start, dry humor is continuously forced down your throat in the beginning of the movie, only to suddenly drop off without warning. It is awkward and poorly paced.<br><br>People outside of the Skywalker family having Force abilities IS NOT new. It has been established in canon multiple times. It is nit groundbreaking or revolutionary. It is just untasteful repitition in attempt to be quirky.<br><br>The destruction and regression of the charatcers is another huge thing. Remember, this movie takes place a day after TFA and is about a span of a week. Rey, who absolutely DESPISED Kylo to begin with, ships herself into the enemy\'s hands because she has apparently forgotten all of the stuff Kylo put her through. Leia barely bats an eye after losing her husband AND her brother literally days apart. Also she suddenly gives you on her son, literally after stating that she believes there is still good in him?<br><br>Luke. Possibly the worst. A man who saw the good in his father, who killed children and innocents atop many other things, when no one else would. Luke would never DARE think about killing a SLEEPING CHILD, who hadn\'t even turned to the dark yet, because he was "scared". <br><br>Finn barely developed and that is sad. Have you all forgotten that Finn came from nothing? And yet Rian reduces him to practically nothing.<br><br>General Hux did not fear Kylo or Snoke and was terrifying, yet he\'s reduced to a coward and a comedic relief.<br><br>Snoke and Phasma were unceremoniously killed off after greatly teasing their importance and the mystery surrounding them.<br><br>Also, the forced romance was NOT needed, it was actually repulsive. Kylo abused Rey and manipulated her, yet she feels compelled to help him and symphathize with him? Rose suddenly loves Finn after knowing him for two days? Yikes.<br><br>And ultimately, Star Wars has ALWAYS been about family. If you want something new, then the Skywalker epilogue isn\'t for you.<br><br>Let me make it clear that the reviews for this movie aren\'t bad because some "men despise the female lead". If it was truly about that, then TFA would have suffered the same way. This isn\'t just a bad Star Wars movie, it is just a bad movie in general. Rian Johnson has poor writing abilities. It was his job to tie TLJ to TFA, yet he chose to ignore almost everything and made something that lacks continuity.<br><br>I would suggest not wasting your money and time on this movie.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/954377209/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/100001897540315/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/954377209/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Jorge T</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span>\xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="15"></span></div> The Last Jedi has some good moments but that makes the entire thing more disappointing.

This film was a deliberate kick in the face to people like myself. Worse, it was a shovel full of shit to the face. Never have I felt so disrespected before in film history.<br><br>Here\'s a question that I want answered: Why the f*** would I ever watch a Star Wars move after this one again? There is nothing left, no story thread worth pursuing. Anything that was interesting from this universe has been erased. Every character that made Star Wars iconic has been killed, and in a very unsatisfactory manner. <br><br>This film goes out of it\'s way to insult the viewer. Maybe the prequels weren\'t going to win any Oscars, but at least I didn\'t feel like George Lucas wanted to punch me in the face, or that he despised me and wanted me to suffer. They are masterpieces in comparison to this garbage. <br><br>The writers of this film obviously have a deep, bitter, seething resentment. They take it out on the fanbase (no surprise as to them probably 80% of Star Wars fans are old school straight males). Superfeminist Kathleen Kennedy and gay man Rian Johnson have a vendetta against the viewer, and they really go out of their way to make us suffer, probably for the crime of being born.<br><br>Let me say I don\'t give a damn about politics. I\'m a liberal, I believe in letting anyone do whatever the hell they want, as long as they don\'t bother me. I wish films could be free of political agendas but sadly this is becoming less and less common in our world.<br><br>The creators sacrificed good storytelling in lieu of pushing an agenda. The story is pathetic, badly told, full of plotholes and pointless. It has no beginning, middle or end. They do not even mildly follow the story of TFA. It\'s like a reboot of a reboot, no continuity whatsoever. There is a casino planet full of evil white people (I challenge you to find any "diversity" amongst the tuxedo-wearing, stuck up , wealthy patrons), an asian chick that has no point in existing. Even Finn\'s character was butchered, reverting into the coward he was in the beginning of TFA.<br><br>But the biggest coward of all is Luke Skywalker. Things got rough so he fled the known galaxy, spending his days cut off from the force, doing practically nothing and milking the tits of a purposefully disgusting, revolting, alien just to survive. Luke, who defeated Vader and was a hero of the rebellion, who stood unarmed before the emperor with no fear, left his sister alone to fight against evil. Even when he found out his best friend Han Solo, (who on several occasions saved Luke\'s life), was killed, he just cries and whines some more, and remains unmoved. <br><br>Our childhood hero, the eternal optimist and the bravest soul in the galaxy, was absolutely and completely butchered. Quoting Mark Hamill, "This is not Luke anymore. Maybe it\'s Jake Skywalker, but he\'s not my Luke Skywalker." He was purposefully humiliated, and his character destroyed.<br><br>I will never watch a movie from these filmakers ever again. If someone enters your house, smashes your toys and shits on your rug, that is not "being bold"; that is insulting. You never invite that person over again.<br><br>These movies are statement pieces, nothing more. They are meant to deconstruct cultural icons, trash them, and replace them with concepts of "diversity", and "feminism". They destroy Luke because he symbolizes classic heroism,and knighthood, embodied in a simple man. Cultural Marxists abhore tradition, traditional mythology, and traditional ideals. Destroy the world, and rebuild it into what you want it to be. They clearly state for you exactly what they want to do with this franchise; let the past die... kill it if you have to.?<br><br>Avoid at all costs. Star Wars is dead.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Ben B."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/976618817/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Ben B</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="40"></span></div> A visually appealing, decent movie, but is often overrated.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977053671/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/10208365164006902/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977053671/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span>\xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="25"></span></div> Very good visual, good jokes, but too many plots holes ( Leia Popins, all of the Fin\'s intrigue...) and I\'m disappointed that we still know nothing about Snoke or Rey\'s parents.</div> </div> </div>']
