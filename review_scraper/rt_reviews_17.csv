This film seems to understand the concept of the Force better than any Star Wars movie since the original trilogy, and explores it in a new and exciting way. The character development for all the major players is at the same time natural, surprising, and thematically charged in a balancing act that is very hard to pull off but is for the most part executed flawlessly here.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Omikron O."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977052146/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Omikron O</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> This film made me lose all the faith in star wars that episode 7 had renewed.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977052124/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/10154968611702294/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977052124/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> sjws have ruined comic books and now star wars . major plot holes , all men are bad only women are good . they ruined lukes sky walkers story . what a pos</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977052129/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/10159875909740582/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977052129/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="10"></span></div> Gotta say ruined it for me.

When what time others give us we see we return to those the thing that\'s there\'s, when they are wanted again to give the Jedi Order a chance in others. When what time we have left we see we don\'t have when others found new ways to limit our chances of escaping when they are able to detect and follow us. <br><br>When what time we see others have had to complete their training we give another chance. When what chance we have in proving ourselves, we see the time to retailiate is now. When what thoughts time can provide we see we don\'t have a chance in fulfilling the dark sides will when we fail to take out those who stand in our way. When what time brings to us is what we already possesed when we are the heir of a Jedi to use the force for another chance. When we see we have little chance when our weapons and machines are destroyed we see only to escape when time is all we have left. <br>*Rey\'s parents sold her? * Who sold the weapons? *Hyperspace tracking think tank since Rogue One<br><br>When what little time others have we see there training is complete when they have it in them already what they needed to see. When we see time ravishes us all to not give such things like the force a second chance when it has lead to so much destruction, death, and no use against the dark side. When we see that time away from such forces we see that we give a second chance when we need to see that special connection with those we miss &amp; love. When we see that the time for the Jedi is to end when we make sure no one gets a chance to manipulate or become one to destroy it all. When times of hope &amp; fear we see others make us see who we are to give us a chance at what we are meant to do when they have guided us along the way, when they are our master. <br><br>When what we see what others get a chance in becoming they see over time a connection they have with others like them to be bound by such unknowing connections. When such connections are manipulated into being real when the dark forces brings two in seeing souls to have a chance to join together when the time is right. When what we see is not what others saw to see that the dark side over time gives a chance to those to decide which side they want to be. When what time we feel others could become if we give them a chance to become one we try to kill, but see they are far too powerful when they are our nephew. When we see that what chance we have in winning is not within those on our side but those on the dark side when time is of the essence and we need those to join our side. <br>* Why doesn\'t the Dark Side know Luke\'s location through Rey? * Tarkin Initiative engineers perfected similar plans as in Rogue One * Erso &amp; TF?<br><br>When what we don\'t see in those who are far too powerful we see what they see is their time when such connections didn\'t happen by chance but by manipulation. When we don\'t see the powers of the energy the force brings when it\'s everything within everything that energy surrounds itself to control time and all chances we don\'t see but the force sees it before it happens. When we see that the force can\'t bring back those over time when they are our parents to have another chance at having a family. When we see that what we possess and feel that came from places over time that we were seen worthy to have a chance at possessing such power. When we don\'t see that the force has given the resistance a chance in us to fight for them when the time to fight back is now. When we don\'t see why the force chose us when it\'s given everyone a chance to become one with those guiding them over time to become one, when they are not heirs, or privileged, but those who see what\'s right and fight for what they believe in. <br><br>When what we see as too dark and powerful to stop, we see that there is not enough time or training to defeat those to have our chance as Supreme Leader to only make our chance and claim what is ours at the right time to strike those without looking. When we see we can join the dark side to give the chance we know is right to the resistance we see the last time those we tried to save. <br><br>When we see that there is no time to send those to places to give us a second chance when they got a plan. When what distress we are in we see the resistance destroyed or doesn\'t answer the call when loyalists see it\'s not their time to fight back. When we see a place full of chances when time stands still when your having too much fun, money and power to care in such places the galaxy goes to gamble. When our only chance lies with a codebreaker that buys us time to escape. When what we endup with are the limited chances when time only can get us in and out with the next best thing. When what we put our chances on we will see in time when time is important to us but money is to others. When being in such places we see what are chances are like when over time everyone in the galaxy has been supplying weapons to both sides to fight for profit. When we don\'t see another side to the galaxy when they manufacturer a war they see over time put their chances on the dark side to win when they are most profitable. When we see those we inspired but stuck in such places who believe in what we do is right but too young to fight, see over time their chance one day.<br><br>When we don\'t see the double Cross in those only looking for profit to see others don\'t see it as our time when they don\'t give us a chance to win. When what little chances we have we again rely on the best timing those we don\'t see saving us when they are mechanically inspicous. When what chance others in returning back to those who we were once under we see our time is ended to have a chance to fight them, when we fight for our side. When we see that such ideas for second chances didn\'t work to resort to our last possible chance when time and great leadership can only buy us that much for us to escape. When others must stay and command we see they give us a second chance when they sacrifice their life to buy us time to escape. <br><br>When we see we reach places in time to have another chance to fight. When what doesn\'t want us to have another chance when their out numbered, out machined, out weaponed and out of time to escape, we see we choose to runaway, buy time or fight to the end. When we see those return to give us a chance, buy us some time, make right with those who we haven\'t lost and do what we are meant to do when all hope is about to be gone, fight back.<br><br>When we see what chances we hold, when time has given us something to be in a place of great happiness that the light side still exist, that there are those willing to sacrifice their life for it, that there are now others who bring hope, and fulfill our roles when they believe in us as much as we believe in them. When we see that it\'s not time to end the Jedi when time has given us a second chance to make those a Jedi. When we see it\'s too late to save those who have no chance or time to join us to show the dark side our power. When what time and chances we are given to escape, reach such places and regroup we see what the force bound everything together, from those unlikely souls meeting and saving one another, to those finding their way through the dark side and back, to those knowing when to fight, when to escape and find away out and those that guide us from our past to the present, who were right by us at the right time to give the resistance another chance.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Seth W."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977051940/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Seth W</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> Enough has been said about why this movie sucks.<br>But what about Rotten Tomatoes manipulation of the audience score?<br><br>Below, I\'ve CUT and PASTE an important analysis form "Wes B."<br>And keep in mind, he\'s INCLUDING all the suspicious \'5 star\' scores left by user account which don\'t exist!<br><br>*****************************************************************<br><br>I believe I can show that the current audience score of 49% which RT displays for the Last Jedi is false. I can only speculate as to why they are lying but they clearly are. I did a statistical analysis of all of the audience reviews I was allowed to view. There are nearly 2000 pages of reviews and I was able to access 46 of them. This is a perfectly reasonable sample size which I believe represents an accurate reflection of the overall audience opinion. A five star rating system translated to a scale of 1 to 100 means that each star is worth 20 points. A half star is 10 points etc. Here are my results...<br><br>.5 stars - 339<br>1 star - 173<br>1.5 stars - 66<br>2 stars - 90<br>2.5 stars - 23<br>3 stars - 19<br>3.5 stars- 12<br>4 stars - 26<br>4.5 stars 25<br>5 stars 95<br><br>A sample size of 868 audience reviewers awarded a total of 23390 points for an average user score of 33.8594. Less than 34%. <br><br>I don\'t know why RT is lying to the public, but they are clearly preventing the audience score from falling below a certain level. If RT is protecting Disney\'s interests then this is a conflict of interest of the highest order and this site cannot be trusted. <br><br>*****************************************************************</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/851249825/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/1286165152/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/851249825/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Josh P</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> Just didn\'t like it believe they could\'ve done better really really disappointed</div> </div> </div>']
