Star Wars the last jedi was one of the most incredible and outstanding films I ever watch in my life it had a lot of twists and so many answers you have to put them like a puzzle and I understand it when i put them together plus so much sci-fi action in this and so many creatures I really love the progs they are so cute and you got to love the light saber battles and the blaster battles as well. very artistic the film as well with the set pieces in the film and of course lovable characters from the force awakens and luke skywalker the best jedi ever and I fucking love it. Overall Star Wars the last jedi was one of the best star wars film i ever watch I don\'t care what people say about the are not true fans of the saga only true fans love the films like I do but what a film and just fucking love it. Well done director Rian Johnson you made a well crafted masterpiece of a sci-fi film and the best trilogy I ever love in my life. well done and good fucking best star wars film ever. rest in piece Carrie fisher and my the force be with you,always.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/813875839/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/552316734/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/813875839/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Jonathan B</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span>\xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="15"></span></div> This is such a disappointment. I really, really wanted to like this movie but sadly it has, for me, failed to deliver. True, the last 30 minutes are spectacular but getting there is so verbose and tortuous that I almost gave up the will to live. There are certain aspects of the plot that could have been clever and exciting, but they are lost in stodgy, dull scenes in which nothing of consequence really happens meaning there is little sense of peril or excitement. I knew that there had to be a handing over of the Star Wars cannon from the old guard to the next generation and the previous instalment filled me with hope and expectation but The Last Jedi is a bitter disappointment. We have an overly wordy plot, some cheap, infantile laughs and some very poorly realised characters. Top of my list is the usually dependable Laura Dern as Admiral Holdo, the supposed battle hero who looks more like she should be advertising bath salts from the 1980s. Mark Hamill does himself no favours whatsoever either and is, frankly, annoying. As for poor Carrie Fisher, I can only assume she was shown an early cut on that flight back to LA. This feels like a betrayal of all those kids who queued round the block of their local cinema in 1977.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="B V."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/974643447/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> B V</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> WTF Disney!!! ???

The once enduring hero of the entire Star Wars brand whose rise from an obscure feeble boy to overcome insurmountable odds and unimaginable cosmic adversity, rose to eliminate all evil and restored order to the galaxy.<br>This was only made possible because he himself arrived at the pinnacle of his highest potential, as is the Jedi Master. Established as one with the inner all pervading, ever present indomitable force for all time. <br>Hence even his screen presence without a script in the previous movie was enough to empower the audience to a sense of the highest authority which one comes to expect within the full embodiment of all things associated with such a Master of the force. <br>The full value of Star Wars is built upon the unshakable principal that the highest good is found within a selfless heart that can and will overcome evil. And at the basis of everything there is a force within us that sustains all existence. By sacrificing the limitations of ones own divided intellect and submitting to the holistic force albeit under the enlightened tutelage of two Masters (Obe One &amp; Yoda) you are can rise to become One with the force. <br>Now Skywalkers character has been degraded from the all powerful timeless Master of all things to a disgruntled, dischevelled train wreck who accepts wise counsel from his novice disciple. May the force be with you...What a travesty! <br>Whilst it\'s the role of Hollywood to create drama the twists to this character has effectively thrown the very principles which made the Star Wars a franchise under the bus. <br>Hollywood might not rate too high on the topic of enduring core values. That\'s precisely why Star Wars has been world class franchise because the story until now had remained true to its values. <br>What a shame.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Jay R."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977051410/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Jay R</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> ***SPOILERS***<br><br>I saw Episode IV in 1977 and consider it the best of them all.<br><br>Where to begin with this turd.<br><br>I get it, it\'s sci-fi fantasy. But there\'s a level of reality that must be kept otherwise why not have all the characters flying around like space angel Leia shooting space angel love beams at each other. This movie crosses that line multiple times.<br><br>Rose, I believe her first line is "I fix pipes", then goes on to piloting spaceships and fighters. Apparently in that galaxy far far away pilots are not in great need because every lowly shlub can pilot. Very uninteresting character.<br><br>Finn, no wonder the first order is doomed, everyone in that organisation from high to low knows all their secrets, secret codes, when the codes change, how often they change, layout of ships, how to navigate through ships, weaknesses of ships. I Like the character, but honestly what role would a once lowly stormtrooper have after joining the rebellion other than being their version of a ground pounder.<br><br>Raye, she\'s just a hobo and with no training squares off with multiple personal guards of Snoke, and wins. Just a repeat of the last movie where she takes on Ren/Ben and bests him. Like the actress and character, just needs more attention to detail.<br><br>Kylo Ren/Ben, most uninteresting main bad guy ever. Really whiney, kind of like young Vader. Hux was more interesting, Tarkin was more interesting and his only memorable line was "you may fire when ready". I actually fist pumped when Snoke yelled at him to take that stupid mask off...I couldn\'t understand a word he was saying.<br><br>Luke, thought Hamill did a good job.<br><br>Benecio Del Toro, good character, reminds me of the kind of people Han Solo would run around with except maybe a step or two worse.<br><br>Fairly dopey and uninspiring speeches scattered throughout in an attempt to bolster morale, some painful to listen to.<br><br>Some funny parts, some parts tried to be funny but were lame. Whoever came up with the holding for Hux part should be punched in the face repeatedly and never allowed near a Star Wars movie again.<br><br>The movie breaks down into 3 boss battles, there should really only be one:<br><br>First, dreadnought is destroyed by level bombers...in space. last I heard bombs don\'t drop in space. They\'ve managed to figure out how to travel at the speed of light but not how to create stand-off fire and forget missles.<br><br>Second, battering ram, happens to take just enough time to charge up so the heroes can swoop in to destroy it...except miracle pilot Rose stopped it from happening, can\'t have Finn dead and she managed to survive too.<br><br>Third, Snokes giant ship and the entire first order fleet wiped out by Laura the miracle general/pilot Dern. Advice to rebellion, just make drones out of your giant ships and hyperspace them through your enemies...saves lives. Don\'t worry, you can move your people around in cloaked dinghies because that\'s apparently a widely available technology, not sure why everyone doesn\'t use it if you can put it on dopey escape shuttles.<br><br>At what point do the bad guys go "Hey, I\'ve noticed everything we build gets vaporized due to some stupid design flaw, lets focus on fixing that"?<br><br>Apparently the movie is an advertisement for PETA, SJW and child trafficking. Poor animals, people are so evil. Poor kids, evil adults, someone cue up Randy Watson singing children are our future. Female characters, evil males get put in their place, hell even Poe gets slapped. What the creators did is blatantly obvious. Because it\'s obvious that makes it forced and unconvincing. If they didn\'t try so hard then it might have worked. Back in 1977 before all this nonsense, Leia was a great female character in episode IV. You thought "Oh a princess needing saved", then quickly came to realize she was much more. Now every female in the movie has to try to be a tough guy.<br><br>My intention was not to see the movie just so I could be that guy. I could say I\'ll do it for the next movie but who am I kidding, it\'s Star Wars.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Botond O."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/976834387/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Botond O</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span>\xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="25"></span></div> It looks like a star wars movie, it feels like a star wars movie, it can be enjoyed like a star wars movie, but something fills off , there is something that stops it from actually being a star wars movie.... oh yes... killing frekkin Luke Skywalker before he had an actual normal lightsaber duel, or ...

Last Jedi is the absolute worst SW\'s movie in the history of the franchise. <br><br>I don\'t even know where to begin. Everything from the bizarre, depressing portrayal of Luke Skywalker, to the uneventful backstory of both Snoke and Rey, the horrible plot lines, unimaginative storytelling, to the unsexy weird love triangle between Finn, Rey, and Rose. The comic relief was cringy at best, and anyone over the age of 25, could easily see a huge leftist political agenda being shoved down the throats of the audience.<br><br>The artwork and the special effects in TLJ, are nothing short of spectacularly beautiful. The action sequences are nothing short of thrillingly fantastic. Hats off to Rian Johnson and the art/special effects team for delivering a visual masterpiece. <br><br>What TLJ makes up for in art and action, it\'s lack of depth and emotion are about as shallow as the Gobi desert in mid summer. Sure the movie is a thrill ride, but there\'s no guys and glory. There\'s nothing fantastic, nothing magical and mysterious leading you up to the drop off, instead it just immediately drops off. <br><br>It would be the equivalent of going to an amusement park and the every ride you get on just immediately drops to second you sit down. There\'s no long pull upwards looking down at your possible impending doom, there\'s no looking around at the majestic world around you to get caught up in, as you begin to feel like a God climbing to the heavens above. There\'s no dragging you and any of the characters through the "muck". Therefore you don\'t get emotionally attached to any of the characters in TLJ, I never once felt despair or pain, or fear, or happiness and joy for anyone. <br><br>Infact the only two emotions I could muster up the entire film, was anger and frustration at the writers, directors, and producers of this poorly crafted film. I guess you could say Rian Johnson really brought the "Darkside" out me. I\'m not sure if that\'s a good thing, considering I had high hopes for this trilogy. <br><br>My 8 and 5 year old children could have told a better story. I could have written and produced a more emotionally in-depth movie, and I know countless of other Star Wars fans who could have did it even better than myself. Rian Johnson deserves the credit he gets, which is for making something pretty to look at. Everything else is just a travesty. I would advise anyone who is a long time SW\'s fan to save your hard earned dollars if you don\'t want to see your dreams shot down in flames. Which brings me to another point.<br><br>I understand they want to do away with the old and bring about the new, and I\'m perfectly fine with that as long as it\'s done the correct way. However, it wasn\'t done the correct and honest way. It was done as a quick cash grab, which is aggravating. There was no homage paid to Luke, or any of the old heroes. Where was the lightsaber battle for Luke? What the heck happened to his hope? You can\'t get me to believe? that Kylo Ren, who at best a lesser powerful Darth Maul, could turn the most hopeful Jedi in the galaxy, into a despaired hopeless hermit. You\'re talking about the guy you turned one of the most powerful and evil sith lord, back to the light side. <br><br>I didn\'t have a problem with the astral projection tie in with the force. I thought it was a cool idea, yet it was poorly executed. I also have a problem with Rey and her unmatched skills. You\'re telling me that an amateur at best, beats Kylo Ren? Which is why I can\'t take Kylo Ren serious, and why I say he\'s at best a lesser powerful Darth Maul. You also make her best, Luke??? Why don\'t you just go ahead and hand her the victory on a silver platter, and hand Kylo Ren a trophy for participation... Rey is like a Jedi God, she can do no wrong, she has no trouble but only triumph. I want to see her suffer, so I can feel for her character, I want to love Rey as a hero. I want to go through her pain and tragedy, and her joy and victory. <br><br>What was up with the casino scene? That whole gimmick was just a terrible time filler, which could have been used to show Luke training Rey! That whole casino scene was probably one of the worst scenes in the history of cinematography. Totally unnecessary, and boring.<br><br>Snoke, where do you even start with this guy? Wow, what a let down. We wait two years and all we get is about 15 minutes of an old man in a golden bath robe, showing off extremely powerful skills only to be cut in half? Where\'s his backstory? Who the heck was he, and how did he rise to power after Vader and Sidious died? <br><br>There were so many really good angles they could have took when dealing with Snoke. What about the Darth Plagueis theory? What about the Jar Jar Binks sith Lord theory and tying in the prequels? What about the theory about Snoke being a master of both the light and dark? Why were all of these awesome theories, just brushed aside like nothing matters?<br><br>The Last Jedi, had the potential to be the best SW\'s movie ever, it had the chance to the everything together, and it fell short due to whatever insane reasons Rian Johnson had in mind. The Star Wars franchise was a franchise, that seemed like it would be impossible to ever drop the ball with. However that\'s exactly what was done here. <br><br>What\'s sad, is not only did Disney drop the ball, they might as well just destroyed the franchise. Maybe they\'re? looking to appeal to the younger generation, but they could have still done that and interwoven the old heroes in with the new, while eventually passing the torch.<br><br>What Disney and Rian Johnson did to Star Wars, is borderline blasphemy.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977051509/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/1591244204300689/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977051509/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="10"></span></div> The whole story is just a repeat of Star Wars, badly executed.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/790132605/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/708209815/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/790132605/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Paul B</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span>\xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="15"></span></div> Misplaced humour, no soul, awful new characters...it\'s horrible.<br>Luke has been reduced to a comedy character and what made Ep VII so enjoyable was non-existent here.<br>It\'s over-long and ultimately just the most pointless entry in the whole series.<br>Hux becoming a comedy character.<br>Luke becoming a parody of himself.<br>Feminist agenda bullshit.<br>SuperLeia.<br>Rey\'s parentage.<br>Rey just being powerful to balance the force...!?<br>Luke going away to die...but leaving a map behind.<br>The whole Fin/Rose subplot.<br>Laura Dern\'s pointless character.<br>Po: Hero to Zero.<br>A tiny, unsupported, resitance even after blowing up Starkiller base.<br>Phasma wasted.<br>Snoke wasted.<br>Snoke\'s stupid death.<br>The stupid reason for Luke to kill Ben.<br>...that\'s just a few of the reasons this film sucks.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Mark H."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977051489/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Mark H</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> The director used a beloved film to push his own political views instead of providing any form of story, character development or anything of true meaning.

Disappointed to see so many plot threads from the force awakens dumped without being explored at all, but that shouldn\'t detract from the film itself.</div> </div> </div>']
