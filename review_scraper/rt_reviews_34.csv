I\'m a lifelong Star Wars fan and I absolutely loathe this film. It makes a mockery of the story and canon from the first seven films of the canon. Every plot strand from The Force Awakens is either 1.)ignored entirely, or 2.)given a purposefully anti-climactic ... almost mocking ... resolution. <br><br>This film is just an absolute mess of plot holes, broken or unfulfilled narrative strands, and I don\'t like how it seems to purposefully ignore what Star Wars fans probably want to see. It drops traditions like bad habits and scolds us that we shouldn\'t want them in the first place. There is no lightsaber v. lightsaber battle in a numbered Star Wars film. Rey is just an idealized caricature at this point, and I can\'t identify or enjoy her story because she never struggles and is inexplicably wonderful and perfect at everything she does. If I was Mark Hamill I\'d be devastated at what they\'d done to Luke Skywalker. Luke is going to murder a sleeping child, the son of his sister and his best friend, a child sent to him for instruction and entrusted to his care, because the child is thinking bad thoughts? Are you serious? That\'s really a crucial plot point? Did none of the people working on this story or script ever actually watch a Star Wars movie? The resolution of this film is as stupid and anti-climactic as anything I\'ve ever witnessed. <br><br>I have no idea where they go from here. There is nothing left except scorched earth, ruined plot possibilities, and an utter disdain for the Star Wars I-VII. <br><br>Oh, and one more thing: I do not need a morality/political lesson in my Star Wars films. Least of all, an anti-capitalistic message from Disney, of all companies. They found time for animal rights and war profiteering political messages in this film, but somehow I don\'t think Disney is going to talk about the evils of exploiting third world labor to make toys for rich westerners, bribing legislators to rob our public domain blind, or outsourcing tech jobs to foreign countries or abusing the H1B visa system.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977049042/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/1839853529359548/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977049042/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 12, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="20"></span></div> This movie was absolutely awful and a disgrace to the Star Wars franchise</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977049038/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/1937833436544462/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977049038/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 12, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> It\'s terrible needs a lot of work!!!!</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Joe P."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977048993/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Joe P</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span class="fr small subtle">January 12, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class=""></span></div> Where to start!?<br><br>There was so much wrong with film, that its hard to know.<br><br>The rediculous jokes.

Any scenes that involved Luke, Rey, and Kylo Ren quickly became my favorites. The casino side quest was the only low point, but it\'s nice to see Disney taking risks instead of always pandering to what the fanbase *thinks* should happen. If the Force Awakens was a treat for the original fans who felt cheated by the prequels, then The Last Jedi was the baton pass to the newer generation of fans, and honestly, I\'m both excited and optimistic to see where the galaxy far, far away takes us from here. :)</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Tony M."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977048989/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Tony M</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 12, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="10"></span></div> The only thing I was impressed by were most of the special effects.<br><br>Otherwise:<br><br>- Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy movie!!<br>- Made in a very lazy, lazy, lazy way!!!<br>- Excessive and countless plot holes<br>- Destroys all main characters from the original trilogy in an embarrassing way.<br>- Insulting to three generations of those fans, who really identified themselves with the great story told by SW.<br>- The new characters are not built properly.

Poisoned by political agenda and an overall attempt to appeal to a niche audience who likely never cared for the franchise anyways, this film is an embarrassment. The character story arcs were lacking in any kind of poetry. This is probably the biggest budget fail of story telling I\'ve ever seen.

Also stuffed with real world politics, which was a poor choice in my opinion, regardless of which side it was taking.<br>Absolutely love Star Wars, loved The Force Awakens, liked Rogue One enough, but thanks to this how disappointing this movie was, I\'ll probably just wait to rent whatever comes out next.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="mer s."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977012815/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> mer s</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 12, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> While it was a very enjoyable movie to watch, it had such major issues; the plotholes, general plot choices and characterisation made me not want to see it again and be afraid of how episode 9 will handle this.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/938239079/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/100003626144413/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/938239079/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Cody B</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 12, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="10"></span></div> Feminist garbage.
