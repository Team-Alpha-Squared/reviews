Jokes were out of place, pacing is off, lots of plot holes, missed opportunities, and plot twist just for the sake of plot twist without any payoff. For a sequel to the Force Awakens, this was horrible. Rian Johnson seems to only care about Rey and Kylo story and just decided to mess with everyone else. Finn storyline repeated itself, Poe became a hothead, &amp; General Leia became Superman. Ugh! Cinematography was great though.

To continue the ridiculous character arcs from The Last Jedi, here are my expectations for Disney\'s, Star Wars Episode 9:<br><br>1. Low on food and supplies, the 9 remaining Rebels flee to Ahch-To to milk sea cows and catch Porgs for nourishment.<br>2. Luke, who DIDN\'T really disappear into the Force (his mechanical hand didn\'t drop onto the meditation stone, did it!?), but rather created a Force Teleport, returns to Tatooine to live in Kenobi\'s old home. Luke disconnects from the Force for the last time and begins scaring Sandpeople away from lost droids who venture off into the wilderness.<br>3. Princess Leia, stricken with grief from the loss of Han and now her brother (or so she thinks), dies from a broken heart!!! However, we only get to READ about this in the title crawl for Episode 9! :\'(<br>4. Kylo Ren, decides he can\'t live without Rey (Rey-LO!!!) since his Force Touch experience with her, throws Admiral Hux against a wall (again, again, again, again...) and deserts the First Order to search for Rey.<br>5. Admiral Hux, whose face has been badly scared and injured from Kylo\'s repeated attacks, creates a mask to hide his face, and takes over as the new Supreme Leader. His first major decision is to change the name from the First Order to the Best Order.<br>6. Finn, after trying to sacrifice his life to save the Resistance and finally bringing "meaning" to his life (his defining moment ruined when Rose crashes her pod into his), struggles with depression which makes him flee the Rebels via a "secret" escape pod on the Millennium Falcon (even Han and Chewy didn\'t know existed) and returns to the First Order, only to complete his stormtrooper training, and becomes the new Captain Phasma.<br>7. Rose, finally fixes the hyperdrive on the Falcon after all these years!<br>8. Chewbecca, rotisseries all the Porgs inside the Millennium Falcon and falls in love with Rose.<br>9. Rey, returns to Jakku to read the mind of Unkar Platt, and begins her journey in search for her drunk parents\' grave.<br>10. Poe Dameron keeps blowing things up!<br>11. Admiral Ackbar, who doesn\'t breathe oxygen, realizes he TOO can use the Force, contacts Princess Leia to come and pick him up on their way to Ach-To.<br>12. The young force sensitive boy on Canto, leads a rebellion with more force sensitive kids against their captors to fight for better hourly wages while working with the Fathiers! They also fight for more rest for the Fathiers, so the animals don\'t have to run BACK-To-BACK races after returning from recent planet voyages.<br>13. The "old"Captain Phasma is DEAD for GOOD, so we don\'t have to see any more lame fights!<br>14. Supreme Leader Snoke, isn\'t really dead! He was just using a really good puppet and will return for Episode 9 to reclaim his Empire!<br>15. DJ, after becoming a multi-millionaire from turning Finn and Rose over to the First Order, returns to Canto Bight to begin building a better, and I mean a BETTER, and BIGGEST, and I mean really BIG, new Death Star to bring peace and happiness to the Galaxy!</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977047309/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/2050384458552709/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977047309/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span>\xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="15"></span></div> I love anything starwars, and I loved this, but I have to give it a poor review, because of some stupid plot points. Two huge battle ships out of range from each other for the whole movie, but key characters can whisk in and out when they want too. You could have just put them on a planet with shield and wasted the same time. . Oh that would be another movie..... The force, which all of a sudden included \'free\' training. hyperspace, that can destroy a flotilla of ships (not to mention get let you fly in and under a planet wide shield). Next time, read the script to a bunch of people and if some of them go \'but how did they.....\' then listen. This film stinks of set pieced with the story made up after.

This script betrayed the original characters. This movie failed to answer the questions from the previous movie. The story failed to follow the conventions set up in the previous Star Wars films. The new characters were one dimensional and their archs went nowhere. The not-so-hidden political and social agenda trumped what should have been a good film.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Alex P."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977047275/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Alex P</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> Terrible movie with terrific CGI. Felt like they only cared about making money and not making a quality film. The film lacked common sense and had so many plot holes. They also blew off so many chances for character development and creativity. I tried to logically like it, but I couldn\'t. I will not be giving my money to the Star Wars saga anymore and encourage people to vote with their dollars and keep kids away from this franchise as well. Disney has soiled Star Wars with this soulless trash.</div> </div> </div>']
