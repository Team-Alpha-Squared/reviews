Many fans wanted to see Luke in combat, or training Rey. Many fans wanted to see Snoke do something noteworthy. Many fans wanted to see a Star Wars movie, with it\'s massive, well told story arch, and a complex set of events that just so happen to allow the rebellion to live on in some form. What the fans received was a spit in the face. All fan theories, were outright ignored, which in itself is not a problem, until you count in the way they turned the movies instead of towards the theories, simply killing off certain characters who where the focus of majority of the theories. Other characters had their story lines destroyed, or otherwise negatively impacted. The only interesting thing to happen throughout the entire movie was at the very end, and even this display was not enough to use as the final scene for such an important character in the series as a send-off. The plot of this movie, was a disgrace. It was the plot of all prior Star Wars movies, compressed into one 2 hour film. Many of the event that created the story line were laughable. I mean, flying through space? Really? All of the ships being split in half when only one ship was hit? Why? And then you get the message that took place on the Casino Planet, which essentially told the viewer that Capitalism is a bad system, which only benefits "bad guys". The prior movie, The Force Awakens, was comparatively, an amazing story, and gave them so many setups, of which, they utilized none. The movie was a flop. The critics are biased. At the time of me writing this review, the rating is a stellar 49%. This movie has no bearing on what most fans want the Star Wars universe to look like. They destroyed Luke\'s character, changed the cannon on Force Ghosts, had characters make blatantly stupid decisions as plot armor. and ultimately, the ending was a deus ex machina. While Star Wars movies of the past have had a history of similar endings, those were always accomplished by the main character\'s use of the Force, and the light prevailing over the existing powers of the dark. This is the first Star Wars movie to have the end outcome of the rebellion surviving be caused by the absolutely stupidity of an Admiral seeing a ship moving to face towards his massive dreadnought, and simply declare that it\'s empty. The ship was clearly moving, and being piloted. To simply declare it empty, and ignore it, is ridiculous, and blatant plot armor used to allow the suicidal tendencies of the purple haired admiral of the rebellion to somehow save the day. This entire film, and I hate to say it, I really do, but this entire film was all just progressive propaganda. I don\'t want to believe it, but there is no other reason that explains half of the occurrences of the film. This is not what I want my Star Wars to look like. This is clearly not what the fans want their Star Wars to look like. I\'d say that the highlight of this film was the love Arch between Finn, and that random Asian girl that showed up out of nowhere. The movie was, and is a flop, rating even worse than The Phantom Menace, despite being more modern, with a nearly unlimited budget. And look how that worked out.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Tim%20 D."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977021630/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Tim%20 D</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> Say New Hope in 1977 as a kid.

Terrible editing. Zero character arcs. Plot holes<br> you can drive a truck through. And this is just on its merits, or lack there of, as a film. Now let\'s address its place in the Star Wars cannon. <br><br>There is nothing resembling the spirit and myth is of the first six films in the most popular franchise in all of film history. Most especially the original trilogy. The social commentary throughout the film took priority over any semblance of character development. The tragedy is that there is no way to welcome this film into the series. It destroyed anything Abrams set up in ep 7. And it had an obligation to the series that Johnson just flippantly disregards. <br><br>There is no way I will ever see this movie again. I would recommend to anyone that they save their money. Do not support this trash. It\'s an insult to everything that came before it. And it\'s a shame.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Clarise E."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977050901/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Clarise E</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="10"></span></div> This movie was awful and I don\'t believe the score that the pros gave it.

If you want to take this movie franchise in a whole new direction, why not just write something totally different? You don\'t get to inherit this movie, its lore and characters and then shite on them.<br><br>I disliked the explanation of Rey\'s origins. I disliked what they did to Luke, character assassination comes to mind. I disliked Leia\'s role. I disliked the underused Captain Phasma. I disliked Yoda, he seemed slightly unhinged. <br><br>I hated the jokes, they were out of place in this movie. I hated Rose, she is a horribly annoying person who ruined any scene she was in. I hated Snoke\'s demise, that was a big letdown. I hated the flying Leia scene, this was so corny I laughed out loud.<br><br>I will not see this a second time in the cinema, or even at home.

I was going to give a 4 since yes the Casino planet is a compleat bust but since so many have made fake accoutns voted and then deleted the account im giving it a 5 in a foolish attempt to get the movie up to mid 70% where it belongs according to all other voting sites.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977050842/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/1828348520511091/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977050842/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="40"></span></div> Im not sure why everyone is hating on this movie so much yes is has a few major down points for example the "flying Leia" scene was unnecessary and the Canto bight scenes were drawn out to much. However I feel one of the main reasons people hate this movie is the direction they took Luke\'s character in which to me was actually one of the movies good points it gives the character a more natural and real feel to him, he has created this training school which he loves and wants to create a new generation of Jedi and he can sense that one pupil (Ben Solo) is going to turn to the dark side and possibly destroy everything he has worked towards and in the moment Luke wants to kill Ben before he can destroy everything, lets be honest if you knew someone was going to destroy everything you\'ve worked hard towards you would do anything to protect it showing Luke is just like everyone else it also shows he still has part of Vader in him but everyone seems to hate this because they want Luke to be the perfect hero and they are blinded by there love for him that they dont understand Luke is a human being NO ONE IS PERFECT</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Mo%20 K."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977050846/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Mo K</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/rating/ni.png"> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="ni"></span></div> The story wasn\'t compelling nor were the characters interesting.

Garbage. Absolute garbage. The first time I didn\'t go to see a Star Wars film four or more times in the theatre. Not interested. My child wasn\'t interested in the toy line for the first time after seeing a Star Wars film. Disney needs to clean house and install a council of fans to monitor any future rogue "Directors" in the future. They should have halted this piss poor production. Insulting the base didn\'t expand the market in Asia? Maybe LucusFilm or Disney needs help understanding what they are doing as they are doing it. Oversight is a good thing after a film like this hurts a franchise. Momentary cash in hand doesn\'t beat a steady stream of income from a river that runs from the far off horizon.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Sal B."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977050851/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Sal B</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> So disappointing!!
