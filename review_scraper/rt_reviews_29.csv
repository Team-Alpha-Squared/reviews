It was not what I wanted going in, but I loved what they did with the characters and story. The Force is not a function of only one family. Luke was damaged and broken, yet redeemed himself, as is fitting for this universe. Rey and Ren are two kids playing with powers they do not understand or know how to control. This movie sets up a great option for Episode IX, with the Resistance on the verge of collapse, but plenty of Force sensitives waiting in the wings. I\'m curious and excited to see what Episode IX brings.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Agnivo M."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977049871/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Agnivo M</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 12, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="50"></span></div> This was one of the most efficiently directed Star wars movie after empire strikes back. The fresh portrayal of Luke Skywalker was interesting as it showed how he was in a dillemna. The movie was mainly on character development......Poe learns how to a good leader and take risky decisions while Finn learns that there is a group of people who take advantage of these wars for their own benefit.. the movie also shows what it is to be a rebel t-at sacrificing one\'s life for the greater good is necessary. Iconic scenes such as holdos light speed scene and the snokes room fight was awesome. Mainly the movie shows how the rebellion is struggling to bring Down the first order and how every character is learning from there failures to become better, even master Yoda pops up to lecture Luke...so in one word it was awwwwwwwesome!!</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/907336885/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/1511560735/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/907336885/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Corey C</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 12, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="50"></span></div> Excellent Star Wars movie.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Stephen C."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977049874/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Stephen C</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span>\xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 12, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="45"></span></div> To those who review this movie so poorly, you Star Wars heretics. Do not even bother to call yourself fans of the saga. You missed the point of the whole movie. You beckoned for a movie that was a copy and paste of Empire, you got it. This movie did take themes from ESB and ROJ, but flipped them on their head and gave you something new. Then, they took the Skywalker saber and broke it, intentionally. This is no longer the same story, from now, everything you knew or thought you knew is different, and that is wherein the beauty of the movie lies. The only markdown it receives from me is the forced (pun intended) jokes.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977049831/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/10210033591022494/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977049831/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 12, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="20"></span></div> Pros: Good visuals, OK score, unpredictable<br>Cons: Poor story, off pacing, repetitive, unlikable characters, inconsistent with lore of series, pointless sub-plots, huge plot holes<br>Side note: I felt like the new director used poor judgement inserting obvious moral lessons which felt forced and completely irrelevant to the story.

All the praise is from paid critics, brand loyalty hacks who would pay for shit in a bucket if it had a star wars logo on it, or people who just dont understand star wars. The only good thing about this film is the cinematography, everything looks beautiful and incredibly realistic and yet all the immersion is ruined by just how terrible everything else is. Once you refuse to shut off your brain and see past the effects it becomes painfully obvious. The humor here is of thousandfold cringe compared to any attempts made in The Phantom Menace. The film is just that bad that it brings down not only itself but the sequel trilogy as a whole, and furthermore doesn\'t seem consistent with the larger star wars lore or any of the previous films. Jedi training is no longer required and a rookie can now best a master in a scuffle. Luke Skywalker has become so utterly unrecognizable as a character that even Mark Hamill had to express his distaste for this film and referred to his character instead as Jake Skywalker. Yes he retracted his comments, but this was only done at the bidding of his superiors. Some of the only things that stopped the previous film from being a tired rehash of the original 77 film were the interest of Snoke and Rey\'s origins. These points are discarded in the new film as if they were as expendable as a random stormtrooper. Subversion in this film exists only for the sake of subversion, just as everything in this trilogy only seems to exist for its own sake and serve no greater purpose, much unlike the cohesive epic told by the original 6 films. Say what you will about the prequels but they still told an important background to the events of the OT and the lore as a whole. TLJ seems to have been made by contrarian hacks that think they\'re so clever as they laugh and pat themselves on the back all the way to the bank with your hard earned cash. The makers of the film seem to have not watched any of the Star Wars films before the sequel trilogy and don\'t even seemed to have watched the Force Awakens, as this film seems disjointed to it. The new trilogy doesn\'t have that cohesive,planned feel of Lucas\' vision and instead seems like they\'re just winging it as they go, resulting in what feels like a poor improv and the weakest yet of the 3 trilogies. Episode 9 is still yet to come out but I really dont see them making a comeback from this one.<br><br>"People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians, and if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society. The preservation of our cultural heritage may not seem to be as politically sensitive an issue as "when life begins" or "when it should be appropriately terminated," but it is important because it goes to the heart of what sets mankind apart. Creative expression is at the core of our humanness. Art is a distinctly human endeavor. We must have respect for it if we are to have any respect for the human race."-George Lucas<br><br>What has been done here feels like precisely that, the work of barbarians who seek nothing more than to exercise their power in destroying a cultural heritage loved the world over for many decades, all for the sake of profit. As a lifelong fan of Star Wars since that fateful life changing day 17 years ago when I was only 3 years old and first saw ANH, I never imagined I would live to see the day when the franchise has become such a poor mockery of itself. Perhaps it is just me, but the quote in the film about letting the past die even seems like a subtle jab done in extremely poor taste at those who would reject the new direction. The future is always ripe for the planting of a fresh direction, but for a tree to grow strong it must have strong roots as well. Without the roots, the tree will wither and die. Disney\'s discarding of the EU was one thing, but to turn Luke into a character unrecognizable compared to the OT, along with the futile attempt to rehash it, truly proved once and for all they dont respect the roots. People claim that with time this film will be seen in the same light as The Empire Strikes Back, you will all feel stupid years from now when the hype has died and the film is universally hated, and then you will hypocritically claim to have despised it all along. This move is not only an insult to fans, but also to Mark Hamill and especially Carrie Fisher who deserved a swansong more fitting for a Princess. An utter desecration and vandalization of star wars that feels like a hate letter to all who ever cared for it. I could go on about why this film is terrible but if what I\'ve already said wont convince you then I dont know what will.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="cody r."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977049743/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> cody r</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/rating/ni.png"> <span class="fr small subtle">January 12, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="ni"></span></div> Abysmally written, politically contrived, mean-spirited, with a spectacularly underwhelming turtle-snail chase for a plot; when it\'s not shamelessly swiping from \'Return of the Jedi\' or \'Empire Strikes Back\'. Another victim endemic of the virtue signaling rot peddled by (as contemporary and past history has attested) a hypocritical Hollywood. More concerned with appeasing a self-satisfied politically incestuous community of actors, directors and producers than actually crafting worthwhile entertainment. <br><br> This story, when not raping the original series, uses \'Star Wars\' nostalgia like a condom in an orgy of ineffectual plot lines and ideology-driven tokenism that sends a flawed but promising new trilogy to its grave. <br><br> The story is completely striped of its spiritual dynamism (such as Yoda\'s "luminous beings are we" speech), its ruthless, morally-ambiguous characterizations (such as Han shooting Greedo, or Luke force choking Jaba\'s guards); and it\'s genuine sense of morality. In the original story, the Dark Side poses a palpable temptation for Luke; because in \'New Hope\', Luke\'s motivations are based in vengeance for those he loves. In front of the smoldering bones of his aunt and uncle, Luke joins Obi-Wan\'s mission to go to Aldaran; and when his formative mentor, Obi-Wan, is murdered Luke joins the Rebellion\'s suicide mission on the Death Star. That capacity to hate those who endanger or destroy his loved ones could easily lead Luke down the path of darkness; and that aspect of Luke is the essence of his character progression. It\'s his drammatic question: will he become like Vader, like his Father? Rae, on the other hand, has NO such temptation (because, to start, she doesn\'t even HAVE a father); hence, \'The Last Jedi\', which clearly mimes \'Empire\' and \'Return\'s story structures, falls flat on its face. <br><br>Only ONE apprentice, the one cloaked in darkness, has any palpable conflict. Rae\'s moral conflict is merely burped by the script, to prop up any story progression. The first movie failed to establish her morality and, now, the series\' is just assuming it. The story simply tells us the character\'s character, it doesn\'t demonstrate it. Because, see, that would be good story telling and we can\'t have a flawed female lead.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="The Last Starfighter"> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/964613303/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Li C</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 12, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> So many plot holes.

This movie is a tarnish on a legacy that has already endured the awful prequel trilogy. Star Wars is just a movie to some but to many of us, it represents much more. It is a world of imagination we were introduced to and fell in love with as children and learned to appreciate and cherish as adults. There are many glaring flaws with this movie, as there were in the prequels but what sets this apart is the treatment of the legendary hero Luke Skywalker. Luke deserved a much better ending than this and honestly I will never forgive Disney for this. The opportunity to give a beloved character and actor an epic send-off was squandered here for an edgy dark twist that was not interesting or in line with the Luke we know and love. Mark Hamill did his very best. I wish I could boycott Disney entirely but sadly they are the gatekeepers of much of mainstream creativity and these properties we\'ve grown to love. I wish I could say I will boycott future Star Wars films too and I genuinely would encourage it, but I love this universe so much that I think other directors and writers deserve a chance to give it another go, but I can never support Rian Johnson again.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/915479849/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/1268015842/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/915479849/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Veronika A</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 12, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a disaster. It is not only a complete fail as a Star Wars film in the eyes of a well-versed fan, but is simply a bad movie in general. <br>The Force Awakens laid a base for the new trilogy, albeit shaky, introducing new yet-to-be-developed characters, and a world that looks familiar but feels nothing like the established universe. With the public divided and somewhat unconvinced, the sequel had to expand on its predecessor\'s foundation, shedding light on the questions raised and progressing characters\' storylines in a meaningful fashion, giving their personalities more dimension. Star Wars: The Last Jedi fails entirely at the tasks at hand. <br>Apart from The Last Jedi\'s numerous supermassive plot holes, sudden and ineffective tonal shifts, and characters that remain one-dimensional after yet another 2 and a half hours of screen time, the film\'s storyline is zig-zagging from one unnecessary or questionable event to another. As an audience, all we are left with is to ponder the question "Why?" <br><br>The motivation behind the characters\' actions is often left unexplained, giving them a false sense of complexity. The dialogues are unnatural and very much clich\xe9. The bad jokes jump right in the middle of a serious build-up, shifting the tone dramatically, then disappear just as suddenly, leaving us completely detached from whatever emotional situation is unrolling on the screen. Significant characters come into the picture and are immediately written off, leaving us completely unsatisfied.<br>For a long-time Star Wars fan, The Last Jedi has little to offer other than a few bitter-sweet moments with Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa and Master Yoda, scavenging off the strong sense of nostalgia. As to the simple visual entertainment, apart from one or two enjoyable CGI moments there is neither a good ol\' lightsabre duel nor a grand space battle to wow us. <br>All in all, it is an empty husk of a film under a shiny and money-making label of Star Wars. Good job, Disney, I hope you have made your profit.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/916964815/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/100000192552102/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/916964815/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Zack B</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 12, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="10"></span></div> It was an awful movie.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/796574041/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/543324376/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/796574041/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> George G</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 12, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="10"></span></div> Disney did to Star Wars what EA does to video game franchises: buys the rights then rides the name recognition while providing an abhorrent product comparative to the initial art direction or story thematics.

There are themes about gender and race as well as political overtones that simply do not and have never belonged in a Galaxy Far Far Away... The shots are good and the score but that\'s all that is good in this travesty of film ...The plot is based on built conveniences, its got more holes than swiss cheese and simply is poorly and lazily written...the characters betray and contradict much of what we know about the force and the star wars universe... its particularly disgraceful what they did with Luke\'s character, making him out to have done things that his character would never have done ...there is entirely too much humor ruining pivotal moments and making a joke of Star Wars in general... It gets less than one star and that is being generous... the director, writers and producers could not have made a worse movie...</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977049705/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/1471930512904698/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977049705/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 12, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="50"></span></div> One of the best Star Wars movies.
