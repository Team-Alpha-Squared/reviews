Our complaints are substantive and cannot be dismissed with name calling. Please read the many negative reviews that go into great detail, of which there are hundreds. You might like TLJ, but you can\'t reasonably deny it had major problems that could spoil the experience for many viewers, including myself. If you liked it, just tell everyone what you liked about it and leave it at that.<br><br>Like many others, I created a Rotten Tomatoes account just to rate TLJ. I\'m not fussy when it comes to movies like this. I liked John Carter, The Force Awakens, and Rogue One despite their flaws. Rogue One grew on me as I watched it a couple of times on Blu-ray. The Force Awakens was derivative, but it was OK. It set up Episode 8 pretty well.<br><br>I start with 5 stars because Star Wars. Subtract one star for what they did to Luke and Yoda. Subtract one star because Rey is a Mary Sue. Subtract one star for the weak plot and generally poor writing. After thinking about it for a week after seeing TLJ. I\'m also subtracting a one star for the blatant political messaging. That leaves 1 star. Many other reviews go into the details - no need to repeat them.<br><br>It\'s disappointing. We know Disney can make a decent Star Wars movie (TFA) and even a good one (Rogue One). With a $200 million budget, you\'d think they could do better. Maybe JJ Abrams can salvage Episode 9, maybe not. Disney damaged the Star Wars IP with TLJ.<br><br>*** SPOILERS FOR EPISODE 9 ***<br><br>Mirror Scene. Rey\'s parents are "nobody". Title of Episode 2.

Where to begin - the \'fan\'atical hatred for this episode, the questionable 4/5 star reviews, plot holes, lack of character development / arcs / jarring behaviour, coincidences, running time etc, etc, ETC <br>So much to choose from. it would seem.<br><br>A life long fan of the Original Trilogy (yes, afraid I\'m one of those "I was there at the beginning, you don\'t know how good it was!" *Spaced Ref*), which I freely admit have some questionable moments, but seemingly not so many. <br>I\'ve decided rather than regurgitate those much discussed elements to offer some theories as to the thinking behind these decisions.<br><br>Firstly I believe a \'new direction\' was needed, many people complained The Force Awakens was a retread of Episode IV or a Star Wars Greatest Hits compilation, but The Last Jedi seems to have had no end of the same accusations as well, some of the people - some of the time.<br><br>Defying Expectations - As we now live in an interconnected world, where for the last 2 years virtually every conceivable idea has been debated over endlessly by \'The Fandom Menace\'. It must be increasingly difficult for Writers &amp; Directors to make a film (especially a Star Wars film) that entertains, surprises and meets expectations. So perhaps being an almost impossible task, Rian Johnson decided to defy expectations, just look at his CV and style of filmmaking.<br><br>Mythology Verses Reality / Child verses Adult POV - while we\'d prefer more logic and believability, these are after all fantasy films, so a suspension of disbelieve is required, which is easier for a 10 year old than, say a *cough* 40+ year old. Note-obviously I don\'t know the age spectrum of the disgruntled fans, so this is all theoretical.<br>As the characters have to face some hard truths, so too do the adult audience - heroes are not always immortal, people do change over time, not necessarily for the better and they do make mistakes which inevitably have repercussions.<br>Possibly Rian and Disney are trying to tell the old guard (people who were kids at the time of the Original Trilogy) it\'s time to move on....<br>These films are for children, that shouldn\'t mean OT fans are not considered as important by the corporation, but they are probably thinking of the long game.<br>Show Business is a money making endeavour primarily and it\'s doubtful Disney bought Star Wars because they were interested in furthering the storyline, completing the original character arcs or building the mythology.<br><br>The fact is this franchise has a built in audience spanning 40 years with an unquenchable curiosity, stratospheric expectations and an overwhelming desire to be entertained.<br><br>And I imagine shall continue for A Long Time To Go, In A Galaxy Far, Far Away....</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977051060/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/760487920814718/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977051060/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> It is the worst entry in the series.

The title says it all in that the Jedi are gone and with it, Star Wars.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Jake G."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977050950/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Jake G</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> [[Spoilers]] Having waited for such a long time, excited for the new Star Wars movie, I was, like most fans, completely immersed in fan theories, and giddy to see what they would do to develop the new characters, and how they would expand upon the old. Many fans wanted to see Luke in combat, or training Rey. Many fans wanted to see Snoke do something noteworthy. Many fans wanted to see a Star Wars movie, with it\'s massive, well told story arch, and a complex set of events that just so happen to allow the rebellion to live on in some form. What the fans received was a spit in the face. All fan theories, were outright ignored, which in itself is not a problem, until you count in the way they turned the movies instead of towards the theories, simply killing off certain characters who where the focus of majority of the theories. Other characters had their story lines destroyed, or otherwise negatively impacted. The only interesting thing to happen throughout the entire movie was at the very end, and even this display was not enough to use as the final scene for such an important character in the series as a send-off. The plot of this movie, was a disgrace. It was the plot of all prior Star Wars movies, compressed into one 2 hour film. Many of the event that created the story line were laughable. I mean, flying through space? Really? All of the ships being split in half when only one ship was hit? Why? And then you get the message that took place on the Casino Planet, which essentially told the viewer that Capitalism is a bad system, which only benefits "bad guys". The prior movie, The Force Awakens, was comparatively, an amazing story, and gave them so many setups, of which, they utilized none. The movie was a flop. The critics are biased. At the time of me writing this review, the rating is a stellar 49%. This movie has no bearing on what most fans want the Star Wars universe to look like. They destroyed Luke\'s character, changed the cannon on Force Ghosts, had characters make blatantly stupid decisions as plot armor. and ultimately, the ending was a deus ex machina. While Star Wars movies of the past have had a history of similar endings, those were always accomplished by the main character\'s use of the Force, and the light prevailing over the existing powers of the dark. This is the first Star Wars movie to have the end outcome of the rebellion surviving be caused by the absolutely stupidity of an Admiral seeing a ship moving to face towards his massive dreadnought, and simply declare that it\'s empty. The ship was clearly moving, and being piloted. To simply declare it empty, and ignore it, is ridiculous, and blatant plot armor used to allow the suicidal tendencies of the purple haired admiral of the rebellion to somehow save the day. This entire film, and I hate to say it, I really do, but this entire film was all just progressive propaganda. I don\'t want to believe it, but there is no other reason that explains half of the occurrences of the film. This is not what I want my Star Wars to look like. This is clearly not what the fans want their Star Wars to look like. I\'d say that the highlight of this film was the love Arch between Finn, and that random Asian girl that showed up out of nowhere. The movie was, and is a flop, rating even worse than The Phantom Menace, despite being more modern, with a nearly unlimited budget. And look how that worked out.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Tim%20 D."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977021630/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Tim%20 D</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> Say New Hope in 1977 as a kid. Fan ever since. Was hopeful for Last Jedi but sadly disappointed. Counted over 20 major flaws that could have all been avoided while still accomplishing Disney\'s PC social commentary. Lazy writing and horrible plot development Hoping Solo is better with Ron Howard. No hope for SW9 as Kathlene and JJ are driving this bus.</div> </div> </div>']
