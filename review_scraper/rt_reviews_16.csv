It clearly is trying to emulate the nostalgia of empire strikes back but fails. Jokes are out of place, parts of the story are mess and it struggles to keep consistent tones across scenes. They ruined previous plot lines and all suspense that was set up from ep7. The film tries so hard to be different and unexpected that it falls flat on its head and betrays who some previously established characters even are. However, if you can look the awful writing and simply just want to see a star wars film go for it. However, if things such as 30 minute segments of the film that add little to nothing to the plot and are overall just pointless, save your time and money.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/910721385/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/100000673203871/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/910721385/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Rafal Z</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> Rian Johnson did in 1 movie what Palpatine failed to do in 7 movies, he brought the Star Wars Universe to it\'s knee\'s and destroyed it. The Last Jedi was humiliating for the Luke Skywalker character. A strong-willed single-minded and focused Jedi was reduced to an uncertain, bumbling, paranoid fear driven hermit. A seasoned Jedi master who was so easily overpowered by an untrained force-user. In the end of all the powers at his disposal, Skywalker drew upon an ambiguous astral projection ability that drained him to death. A poor send -off for an iconic character that had more than 4 decades of development. Snoke had the most foolish and ill-conceived death of any major Star Wars character. Luke was ruined and wasted, Snoke wasted, Rey\'s backstory wasted, Kylo\'s character development wasted, Finn had no development, Fisher\'s exit wasted. Don\'t get me started on the ridiculous Force FaceTime calls between Rey and Kylo and "Space Poppins Leia" who uses the force to bring herself back from death? makes total sense just like Luke\'s exit. Also with Luke Skywalker a hero, who could not bring himself to kill his father who murdered millions of people even with Obiwan and Yoda telling him to do so, tries to kill his nephew in his sleep because he senses he may become bad? ARE YOU SERIOUS!!!! THE ENTIRE THING WAS A POORLY WRITTEN WASTE!!! This is the worst Star Wars movie ever made because of the lazy and terribly written story. #notmyskywalker #notmyepisodeVIII</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977052433/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/10214533612081871/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977052433/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="10"></span></div> A total disappointment.<br>star wars is finished with rogue one.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/909325577/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/634101967/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/909325577/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Patrick M</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span>\xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="15"></span></div> 1.5 stars because it was still a Star Wars movie, which generally puts it above most other fluff. That being said, my reaction is negative... Here are 18 points why:<br><br>1. Forced attempt at humor with Poe Dameraan prank calling the Admiral at the beginning of the movie.<br><br>2. Something felt tonally off when they pulled Maz Kanata up on the view port... felt like they were bringing in a marvel character or one of the avengers or something...<br><br>3. They killed Supreme Leader Snoke off without any problems and never gave any information about his backstory whatsoever.<br><br>4. The overall primary plot of the movie (Snoke\'s capital ships slowly chasing after the resistance ships) is not very interesting.<br><br>5. Stupid fucking jokes throughout the movie. Overall tone felt like a poor imitation of Guardians of the Galaxy.<br><br>6. Captain Phasma was pushed as a relatively major character but never really got any screen time in either of the movies she appeared in and then she died.<br><br>7. They killed Admiral Ackbar and I didn\'t even realize that it happened at first.<br><br>8. Luke Skywalker milks a fat alien with 4 breasts and immediately drinks the milk.<br><br>9. Leia gets bombed and ripped out of her ship and into the vacuum. After she freezes to death she comes back to life like a space witch and levitates back into the ship.<br><br>10. When Kylo Ren and Rey first start telepathically communicating it somehow feels so out of place it was absurd. Admittedly, it does get better after the first session...<br><br>11. Adam Driver has strong chest muscles.<br><br>12. Almost the entire middle section of the movie could have been cut out without losing anything. It probably would have made it a better movie in fact. The casino planet is the most uninteresting planet that the Star Wars characters have ever explored.<br><br>13. The ATAT Walker scene with the resistance fighters evacuating at the end is the exact same as the Hoth scene from Empire Strikes Back.<br><br>14. Luke Skywalker would never go out intending to kill Ben Solo while he is asleep.<br><br>15. Apparently Rey\'s parents were junkies. What a story mark!<br><br>16. Luke doesn\'t die in battle but instead fades away when he actually wasn\'t even in the battle and in fact wasn\'t even tired. The "battle" wasn\'t even a battle anyway...<br><br>17. ... speaking of, there are no real lightsaber fights. First time ever in a main storyline star wars movie.<br><br>18. No appropriate send-off or conclusion for Leia/Carrie Fisher.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977052404/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/559246951079901/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977052404/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 14, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> Star wars is dead.
