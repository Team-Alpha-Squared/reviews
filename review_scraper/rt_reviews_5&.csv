I can picture arguments in the back room between Disney and the Director/Writers with Disney winning of course.

It would of given a classic character more screen time and send him off in noble fashion! to obvious maybe? God forbid.<br>...Luke Skywalker threw in the towel and would rather let the whole galaxy fall to darkness? Really? REALLY? way to plant a turd right on top of the original trilogy.<br>...Why not use the canon method of "anti-lightspeed" by giving Snokes ship "intredictor" tech?. Too old school?<br>...Poe is a traitor that can\'t follow orders and literally gets off the hook by being cute...really? He should of sat in the brig the whole movie or even better-dead.<br>..The alliance bombers? why not just use B-wings? oh wait, gotta have new lego sets.<br>..And Star Wars has a serious vehicle "size creep" issue...Smaller and faster is good too...<br><br>The questions and issues just go on and on with this movie...<br><br>Imagine if you will Ruby Rhod reading off a list of everything you want to know about Star Wars and then lighting that list on fire with an over the top "But who cares!"<br><br>The whole "chase the command ship" felt like Battlestar Galactica, the Finn/Casino story line was in fact a complete and total waste of time as it went nowhere without a single plot ramification...except to preach at you and del Toro? over-hyped would be doing the term a disservice. Also what in the world was up with some of the dialog ..."Godspeed"? really? The scenes that worked or were nicely shot could not carry the weight of what fell flat and the last scene...oh man is that a Disney commercial... When all is said and done though it is still better than the all the prequels combined but that is not a high bar to jump..

I too created an account just so I can give a voice to what was wrong with this movie. This was a pretty movie that had Star Wars music, but it was not a Star Wars movie. The rules in that galaxy that we\'ve come to expect no longer apply. There is corny humor throughout and characters acting contrary to their personalities. But, the most offensive part was the social commentary. I could have done without the preaching and heavy-handed poltical issues.<br><br>Since this movie was an obvious attempt at feminism propaganda, I\'ll discuss it by gender...spoilers follow.<br><br>Men <br>Luke - slightly deranged, cranky and weak<br>Poe - impulsive, brash hothead<br>Snoke - weak and stupid<br>Finn - empty and cowardly<br>Kylo Ren - petulant, moody and destructive<br>Hux - a joke<br><br>Women<br>Leia - fearless, wise, can fly<br>Holdo - smarter than all the men<br>Rey - most powerful Jedi ever<br>Rose - worst character/actor ever portrayed in any movie, ever<br><br>Droids and Chewbacca - a mere prop who shared a combined total of about 5 minutes of screen time.<br><br>None of the intriguing questions that the Force Awakens were addressed in any satisfactory way. Rules of space and gravity don\'t apply. Jedi lore and legacy trashed. Scenes that should\'ve ended up on the cutting floor occupy a bulk of time. Time wasted on pointless, tedious scenes that go nowhere. Characters that annoy and spout SJW nonsense (ROSE = JAR JAR BINKS level annoying).<br><br>Really, just a terrible installment of what should have been an amazing story.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Jacob F."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977054933/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Jacob F</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span>\xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 15, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="35"></span></div> Visually stunning, some great action, and... well... that\'s about it really.

Technically it might look nice from shot to shot but the movie is so riddled with issues in logic, plot holes and wasted opportunities that i struggle to find any merit i it whatsoever. Enough people have voiced their distaste so i wont drag this on. The actors did their part, but the writing was dreadful.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Lyserdigi"> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/976951357/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> juuso s</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span class="fr small subtle">January 15, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class=""></span></div> Abysmal letdown.<br>Basically felt most of the movie, like the director and writers were trolling the audience and braking lore and old characters core on purpose..<br>would not see again, will not recommend to anyone.. lost all interest in the franchise, will not go and see episode 9, even for free.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/975446247/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/146721332449286/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/975446247/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Steven G</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span>\xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 15, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="35"></span></div> The finn and rose scenes were a snore fest but the rest of the movie is so awesome that when I look back I forget about it.

I dearly wanted to love this movie. I remember emerging from the theatre stunned, saddened. The reasons are well documented by many here. I never imagined signing up to Rotten Tomatoes but Such was my disappointment at this film, I felt compelled to have my little rant.</div> </div> </div>']
