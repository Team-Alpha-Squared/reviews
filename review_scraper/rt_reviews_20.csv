Last Jedi is the absolute worst SW\'s movie in the history of the franchise. <br><br>I don\'t even know where to begin. Everything from the bizarre, depressing portrayal of Luke Skywalker, to the uneventful backstory of both Snoke and Rey, the horrible plot lines, unimaginative storytelling, to the unsexy weird love triangle between Finn, Rey, and Rose. The comic relief was cringy at best, and anyone over the age of 25, could easily see a huge leftist political agenda being shoved down the throats of the audience.<br><br>The artwork and the special effects in TLJ, are nothing short of spectacularly beautiful. The action sequences are nothing short of thrillingly fantastic. Hats off to Rian Johnson and the art/special effects team for delivering a visual masterpiece. <br><br>What TLJ makes up for in art and action, it\'s lack of depth and emotion are about as shallow as the Gobi desert in mid summer. Sure the movie is a thrill ride, but there\'s no guys and glory. There\'s nothing fantastic, nothing magical and mysterious leading you up to the drop off, instead it just immediately drops off. <br><br>It would be the equivalent of going to an amusement park and the every ride you get on just immediately drops to second you sit down. There\'s no long pull upwards looking down at your possible impending doom, there\'s no looking around at the majestic world around you to get caught up in, as you begin to feel like a God climbing to the heavens above. There\'s no dragging you and any of the characters through the "muck". Therefore you don\'t get emotionally attached to any of the characters in TLJ, I never once felt despair or pain, or fear, or happiness and joy for anyone. <br><br>Infact the only two emotions I could muster up the entire film, was anger and frustration at the writers, directors, and producers of this poorly crafted film. I guess you could say Rian Johnson really brought the "Darkside" out me. I\'m not sure if that\'s a good thing, considering I had high hopes for this trilogy. <br><br>My 8 and 5 year old children could have told a better story. I could have written and produced a more emotionally in-depth movie, and I know countless of other Star Wars fans who could have did it even better than myself. Rian Johnson deserves the credit he gets, which is for making something pretty to look at. Everything else is just a travesty. I would advise anyone who is a long time SW\'s fan to save your hard earned dollars if you don\'t want to see your dreams shot down in flames. Which brings me to another point.<br><br>I understand they want to do away with the old and bring about the new, and I\'m perfectly fine with that as long as it\'s done the correct way. However, it wasn\'t done the correct and honest way. It was done as a quick cash grab, which is aggravating. There was no homage paid to Luke, or any of the old heroes. Where was the lightsaber battle for Luke? What the heck happened to his hope? You can\'t get me to believe? that Kylo Ren, who at best a lesser powerful Darth Maul, could turn the most hopeful Jedi in the galaxy, into a despaired hopeless hermit. You\'re talking about the guy you turned one of the most powerful and evil sith lord, back to the light side. <br><br>I didn\'t have a problem with the astral projection tie in with the force. I thought it was a cool idea, yet it was poorly executed. I also have a problem with Rey and her unmatched skills. You\'re telling me that an amateur at best, beats Kylo Ren? Which is why I can\'t take Kylo Ren serious, and why I say he\'s at best a lesser powerful Darth Maul. You also make her best, Luke??? Why don\'t you just go ahead and hand her the victory on a silver platter, and hand Kylo Ren a trophy for participation... Rey is like a Jedi God, she can do no wrong, she has no trouble but only triumph. I want to see her suffer, so I can feel for her character, I want to love Rey as a hero. I want to go through her pain and tragedy, and her joy and victory. <br><br>What was up with the casino scene? That whole gimmick was just a terrible time filler, which could have been used to show Luke training Rey! That whole casino scene was probably one of the worst scenes in the history of cinematography. Totally unnecessary, and boring.<br><br>Snoke, where do you even start with this guy? Wow, what a let down. We wait two years and all we get is about 15 minutes of an old man in a golden bath robe, showing off extremely powerful skills only to be cut in half? Where\'s his backstory? Who the heck was he, and how did he rise to power after Vader and Sidious died? <br><br>There were so many really good angles they could have took when dealing with Snoke. What about the Darth Plagueis theory? What about the Jar Jar Binks sith Lord theory and tying in the prequels? What about the theory about Snoke being a master of both the light and dark? Why were all of these awesome theories, just brushed aside like nothing matters?<br><br>The Last Jedi, had the potential to be the best SW\'s movie ever, it had the chance to the everything together, and it fell short due to whatever insane reasons Rian Johnson had in mind. The Star Wars franchise was a franchise, that seemed like it would be impossible to ever drop the ball with. However that\'s exactly what was done here. <br><br>What\'s sad, is not only did Disney drop the ball, they might as well just destroyed the franchise. Maybe they\'re? looking to appeal to the younger generation, but they could have still done that and interwoven the old heroes in with the new, while eventually passing the torch.<br><br>What Disney and Rian Johnson did to Star Wars, is borderline blasphemy.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977051509/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/1591244204300689/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977051509/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="10"></span></div> The whole story is just a repeat of Star Wars, badly executed.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/790132605/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/708209815/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/790132605/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Paul B</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span>\xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="15"></span></div> Misplaced humour, no soul, awful new characters...it\'s horrible.<br>Luke has been reduced to a comedy character and what made Ep VII so enjoyable was non-existent here.<br>It\'s over-long and ultimately just the most pointless entry in the whole series.<br>Hux becoming a comedy character.<br>Luke becoming a parody of himself.<br>Feminist agenda bullshit.<br>SuperLeia.<br>Rey\'s parentage.<br>Rey just being powerful to balance the force...!?<br>Luke going away to die...but leaving a map behind.<br>The whole Fin/Rose subplot.<br>Laura Dern\'s pointless character.<br>Po: Hero to Zero.<br>A tiny, unsupported, resitance even after blowing up Starkiller base.<br>Phasma wasted.<br>Snoke wasted.<br>Snoke\'s stupid death.<br>The stupid reason for Luke to kill Ben.<br>...that\'s just a few of the reasons this film sucks.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Mark H."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977051489/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Mark H</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> The director used a beloved film to push his own political views instead of providing any form of story, character development or anything of true meaning.

OK was left wondering on that.<br>Next, with Carrie Fisher no longer with us, they missed a chance to write Leia out of the film. Instead there was a convoluted and unnecessary "recovery" in space to survive and return to the ship?<br>I was less-than-impressed with Mark Hammill\'s acting performance, I mean can we now see why he basically hasn\'t worked in 40 years?<br>Finally, not sure why Star Wars writers/producers insist on the Empire always having some *one* glaring vulnerability for the Rebellion to go after. Like the tracker, they only have ONE? Seems like they would have an unlimited budget based on the staggering amount of ships, equipment and personnel they have, but that is where they cheap out?<br>For that matter, why is the Empire so lacking in any kind of tactical skills? I mean, one ship attacking at the end, with no other ones anywhere to be found just in case an escape is made?<br>And why did they insist on adding the "cutesie" little Porgs in the most annoying way? OK I get they\'re trying to maybe hold little kids\' attention or work on fattening up the film\'s merchandising potential, but didn\'t have to lay it on so thick with those things.<br>I don\'t deny there weren\'t some good moments, the special effects were on-point as always.

The politics are far too current and on-the-nose, which practically spells disaster even in the short term. The plot holes are gaping and utterly distracting around every turn. The subversion for the sake of castrating adult male nerds who adore the franchise was a bold decision in the sense that it was a monumental mistake. Classic cinema lives on as generations make way to new ones, which means we need our nerdy dads and moms and aunts and uncles to show us what is great. And there\'s no way in hell im showing this to my son or daughter in the future. What would i say to them? "Hey kids, strap in, this is a fun ride that teaches you about constant failure and that\'s life, constant failure, unless you only take lessons from your mother and female figures, then you\'ll be ok in the end, although most people around you won\'t matter at all. Matter of fact, screw them, what does it matter anyway? We\'re all just a drop in the pond, so dont try to elevate who you are as a human being, because its a waste in the bigger picture." I honestly feel sorry for the parents who took their ten-year-olds to see this. In Star Wars, they should be able to witness the construction of a hero, not the rapid deconstruction of a villain who murdered his father. Anyway I digress... My assumption is that Johnson brought a solid foundation of ideas but was quickly swallowed up by the sudden iron fist of feminist hollywood currently dethroning and defaming any male who refuses to conform. He is now digesting slowly in Disney\'s sarlacc pit of despair and i wouldn\'t hesitate to doubt that we will never again see an interesting film out of Rian Johnson.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="George F."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977051419/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> George F</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="20"></span></div> Nice effects, Movie dragged, Not invested in any of the new characters.

This is unlike any other Star Wars movie, but it is definitely a Star Wars movie. <br><br>It\'s not without its flaws. There\'s an entire gambit that our heroes go on that results in absolutely nothing lost or gained. There\'s a sense that there are no stakes, since every character that dies is inconsequential. There\'s also a sense of breaking with tradition in the Jedi order itself, that many fans probably didn\'t like. I get where this complaint is coming from, but I kind of want to see where they go from here.

None of these characters are likeable or complex, every sentence is punctuated by SNL style one-liners that always fall flat, and none of the plot threads from the previous film are followed up on.

I think this film axed more characters and amputated more plotlines than it left standing. This movie basically rolled back all of TFA, badly, awkwardly, and without any skill. If this guy is making a whole TRILOGY of Star Wars movies, that could end up being the end of Star Wars.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/976977109/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/10156064381923629/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/976977109/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> I thought I was watching a parody, or a fan film.

If this movie had given a good explanation about Snoke, an actually good answer to Rey\'s parentage, not made Leia look super dumb, gave a moment of silence for Ackbar\'s death, and made Luke\'s death powerful and meaningful, and removed their Social Justice Warrior agenda, then the movie would be very satisfactory. Hopefully J.J. can help build back up this mess that Disney and Kathleen Kennedy gave us. Filth that they are.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Pax A."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977051273/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Pax A</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 13, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="10"></span></div> If one day I will be forced to rewatch this movie again I will just pretend that it takes place between ep 3 and 4 and that the Resist..ehm..Rebellion is fighting against the Empire, with the support of a casual Jedi survived to the order 66 that chose to retire himself in an Island, and will pretend that this is not Luke Skywalker</div> </div> </div>']
