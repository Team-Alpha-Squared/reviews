The guy (JJ) ruined the casting and created an unbelievably hokey and unoriginal initial story line of the first movie. Direct your anger at Disney, JJ and their greed, not Rian Johnson. <br><br>In order for Disney to regain it\'s fans it must do some of the following things:<br>1. Make an Obi-Won movie with no SJW nonsense, starring the man, the legend, Ewan Mcgregor, who single handily raised the bar for the prequels. <br>2. Disown JJ Abrams. <br>3. Disown JJ Abrams<br>4. Make a prequel trilogy to this trilogy with Luke Skywalker in it. We all know this will not happen however, as it seems Disney only wants strong women to play their roles these days. To bad young women don\'t give a rats ass about Star Wars (Compared to boys).<br>5. Hire George Lucas for his creative input, because no one at Disney has any. <br>6. Disown JJ Abrams<br><br>I would also like to give a shout out to one of the "super reviewers" on this website (Carlos Magalh\xe3es) who gave this piece of crap movie 4.5 stars, while giving many classic Hitchcock movies 3 stars.

There were pointless and illogical plot elements (code breaker wasn\'t needed in the end, old-peoples-speed-chase between Snoke\'s and the rebel ship), many scenes with over-acting (looking at you, Poe-BB8 reunion), MCU-style jokes that didn\'t fit a Star Wars movie\'s tone, and many payoffs that ended up being very underwhelming (Snoke was just some generic villian, for example). Another big issue is that there wasn\'t much 3D to enjoy, I felt ripped off for paying for 3D. The Infinity War trailer was shown at the beginning and that had amazing 3D. Whatever Star Wars 9 is gonna be, I have 0 reasons to go watch it after seeing Last Jedi.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="B M."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977048014/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> B M</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="10"></span></div> This is one of two movies I\'ve ever so considered walking out of, the other being The Phantom Menace.

The movie is truly that bad, and it\'s both incomprehensible and terribly sad that Disney sacrificed e future of a multi-billion dollar franchise to push the politicized viewpoints of the producer and director. And even the politicization was only part of the problem, the other part being professionally incompetent storytelling.

This movie is laughably bad. Forced comedy (if you can call it that), pointless plot lines that accomplish nothing both in the movie and to further the plot, throw away characters and weak leading men and women (and whatever snoke is). This is sci-fi right? Not just fi? Why in Yoda\'s name are the shots in space ARCING?! If a ship can suicide with hyperdrive and take out huge swaths of the enemy, why is this the first time we\'ve seen it? Since when, IN SPACE, does a "lighter" ship get to outrun a larger one? Engine size matters, as we saw clearly and correctly in A New Hope. Then there\'s the ridiculous bombers in the opening sequence. Forget the pointlessness of a bomber in SPACE relying on a gravity fed bomb chamber; if you can slowly fly your nearly defenseless bomber all the way to the weak point of the super huge bad guy ship, just shoot a freakin missile from far away and be done with it. How about Ren\'s squad taking out part of the Resistance ship with one shot while STAR DESTROYERS bombarding it have seemingly no effect. This is the whole movie. Terribly thought out everything. Luke and a brief R2 sighting are the only halfway decent parts and they are about 10 minutes of it. It\'s sad really because it could have been great. Forget the dazzle of the ship battles and chase scenes and other nonsense. Most of this movie should have been dedicated to Rey coming of age as a Jedi either alongside or in spite of Luke. She also should have turned a little dark. She should have been the one to kill Snoke and then tried to but failed to kill Ren. At least there would be something to her character then. Finn, Poe, Lea, Hux, and Snoke should have been bit parts bookending the real plot.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="nick p."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977047857/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> nick p</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> The cinematic visuals are absolutely stunning. Other than that the movie was a pretty big let down. The quality of this trilogy is plummeting for each movie. star wars physics as well as regular physics are broken and in contradiction of previous movies in the series. the story is a lack of creative ideas and oddly similar to the Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. idk why they felt the need to have a PETA commercial in the middle of a time sensitive moment in the movie. zero character development or I should say Zero to jedi master during a time sensitive moment, no real training or time required. too many Disney "like" actors. creating "cool" and "Hardcore" characters then being easily defeated by children type characters. too many impossibly miraculous strokes of luck... like 20 times in a row! come on... need I say more... time and urgency means nothing. Politically charged. SJW agenda. OLED product placement. It is clear that their main priority was to generate profits (such as paying someone to write an original story and so on).

There\'s no mystery, no fear, no soul - it feels like a bunch of weird scenes just thrown together. The writing is immature, corny, confusing and boring. The villains aren\'t intimidating, the heroes aren\'t inspiring. It\'s shot and edited very strangely. There are too many moments which lack context, explanation or reason to mention. I\'m no massive SW fan, but this movie missed the mark in so many ways I\'m amazed it made it out of the editing room and onto the big screen.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="pm1msd"> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/904450851/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Martin D</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="40"></span></div> Unexpected twists keep this latest installment fresh.</div> </div> </div>']
