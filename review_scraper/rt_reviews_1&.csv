I had all the toys, I made all the Star Wars legos. The Star Wars movies became something that felt near and dear to me and kind of felt like it was part of my family. When these new movies and the sequel trilogy started coming out I felt like I became even more of a die-hard fan, like I was a kid again playing with my brother and going to see this awesome story of the ultimate good vs the ultimate evil. And I loved the feeling that The Force Awakens and these new movies were bringing back to the franchise; I was overwhelmed after seeing The Force Awakens for the first time, like it was the movie I had been waiting for so long to finally see. Then I went into The Last Jedi also expecting to see this Star Wars movie that I felt like I had been waiting almost my entire life to finally see. And yet, as much as I want to love this movie, I just can\'t. I understand all of the criticisms that The Last Jedi has gotten, and the feeling that it wasn\'t really much of a Star Wars movie and that everything built up before it was thrown out: The mystery of Snoke basically getting thrown away, Luke\'s backstory and disposition in the movie, Kylo Ren\'s backstory as it related to Luke and Snoke, Leia\'s near death/force powers, some of the seemingly pointless plot lines, all of the forced/slapstick comedy. I can really get over all of those, and in a lot of ways I actually agree with a lot of those decisions and how they did a lot of those things in the movie. It was awesome to have something different and new, and add a lot of things that had never been done before in the series. I can understand all of the criticisms to the movie, and yet I can get on board with all of those story lines and the direction of every piece of the movie. Except one. I cannot get on board with Rey just "being a nobody", no matter how much I think about it. I 100% completely agree with the argument that anybody should be able to be a hero or be able to use the force, and that anybody can basically become a Jedi/be powerful with the force, and that it shouldn\'t be exclusive to just a certain few who come from a particular family. Hell in the prequels there were hundreds of other Jedi\'s and padawans who were obviously all force users. But yet having said that, I don\'t understand why they couldn\'t accomplish both. Why couldn\'t they show that anybody can be force sensitive and/or become a Jedi while also having Rey have a deep personal/family connection to the Skywalkers/Ben Solo? At its core Star Wars is supposed to be about the Skywalker saga, that\'s the main point of the entire episodic series. And having Rey, the main protagonist be a nobody, in a lot of ways ruins all of that. What made the other Star Wars movies great were the interpersonal conflicts between the main characters as being the main conflict in the story. Luke vs Darth Vader, his father. Obi Wan vs Anakin, his apprentice/best friend/partner. By having Rey be a nobody, kind of makes this sequel trilogy pointless in a lot of ways. Yes obviously Kylo Ren is a Skywalker/Solo, but he\'s not one of the 2-3 main protagonists that you as the audience are emotionally invested in or are supposed to share an emotional interest in. In the prequels that was Obi Wan, Anakin and Padme. In the original trilogy that was Luke, Lei, and Han. In this trilogy its Rey, Fin and Poe. By having Rey be a nobody, it\'s hard to really care about what happens to her or the people she cares about. Rey could die or go to the dark side or destroy the resistance in Episode 9, and yet nobody would really care, because she\'s a nobody in the story. The notion that for this movie the hardest thing Rey could hear would be that she was a nobody, feels extremely weak and short. That notion holds very little to Luke finding out Vader is actually his father, or Obi Wan finding out that Anakin had turned to the dark side and betrayed the Jedi order. This movie and sequel trilogy as a whole would be a lot more powerful and have a lot more meaning if Rey had a deeper interpersonal conflict with Ben, if say she found out they were actually brother and sister. These movies would be a lot more meaningful if Kylo Ren and Rey were pitted against each other, yet both were deeply conflicted because they couldn\'t kill their own sibling, the way Luke couldn\'t kill Vader, or Obi Wan couldn\'t kill Anakin. I\'m trying to resign myself to the idea that I need to wait to see how everything comes full circle in Episode 9, to see if a lot of the holes and mysteries that have been put forth in this trilogy can be fulfilled in a more meaningful way, and that in my hopes they add much deeper significance to this piece of the story and to Rey\'s parentage/back story, meaning, and interpersonal conflict, and that is the only reason why I am even giving this movie a 2/5. I hate to say, but in a lot of ways this could honestly ruin much of the essence of Star Wars for me. If Rey was to somehow actually be a Skywalker and for that to come full circle in Episode 9, I would probably give this movie a 5/5 in a heartbeat. But if Rey is still just a nobody after Episode 9 and the "Skywalker saga" is to be finished and thrown away the way it is right now, then to me this movie and trilogy would end up being a 0/5, and most of my interest in the future of Star Wars would probably and unfortunately be gone.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Matthew M."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977055414/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Matthew M</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 15, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> Although fundamentally a well-constructed film, and at times enjoyable, Rian Johnson in the TLJ has sought to deconstruct the underlying hero\'s journey, which is the underlying theme to the Star Wars mythology that George Lucas created approximately 40 years ago. Luke Skywalker, which for many fans was the quintessential hero has been repositioned as a lost soul who wallows in his victimhood and appears as a tragic hermit. In addition, the force and the concept of the Jedi, which over the last 40 years has gained an almost religious adoration amongst fans has also been deconstructed. Consequently, the dark and light sides of the force have been treated with an almost relativistic indifference and the films overt intersectional politics overwhelm character and plot development. <br>In this regard TLJ is essentially a postmodern reworking of Lucas\' various underlying universal themes such as the hero\'s path, and the eternal conflict between the dark and light sides of the force. We are told by Disney executives that this reworking is in order to take the brand in "bold new directions". Hence in a scene, which almost breaks the fourth wall, Kylo Ren the new emo villain of the series outlines the new path of the franchise by stating, "Let the past die. Kill it if you have to...". Hence, one cannot help but come away with the impression that the film has been produced by disgruntled nihilists that believe that their vision will usurp George Lucas\' vision. In this I believe they are mistaken. <br>The concept of a hero\'s journey is a universal one that transcends culture, religion and gender. It is a concept that George Lucas well understood having been heavily influenced by the work of Joseph Campbell and the concept of the metamyth. Unfortunately for Disney, the hero\'s journey is not compatible with postmodernism\'s inherent nihilism and victim reverence. Luke\'s fall has broken one of the central tenants of the hero\'s journey \'The Return\' in which the hero returns having retained the wisdom gained on the quest and thus ultimately achieves bliss. It is therefore little wonder that Mark Hamill and many superfans were deeply hurt by the unwinding of Luke\'s hero journey. According to Johnson, Luke was a victim and not the hero many visualised. <br>I believe that the franchise has been irretrievably damaged by the insertion of this path into the SW mythos much in the same way that the New Coke/Classic Coke fiasco did to Coca Cola in the 80s. Although many preferred the taste of New Coke the decision was a disaster. Much like Coke Disney has misunderstood the power of the core tenant upon which a brand stands. Unlike Coca Cola fiasco, however, the damage will be a near impossible task to minimise less undo. I therefore cannot award this film anything but a half star as I believe in time this film will be seen as a franchise killer.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/911115123/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/1847568166/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/911115123/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Fred S</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 15, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> Way to ruin a franchise in one movie.

And Luke commits suicide by Astral Projection, well that\'s a bad way to go out! 2 Lightsaber battles vs Kylo Ren &amp; none of them lasted 40 seconds. Christopher Reeve in Superman IV went out better than Mark Hamill did in this movie, that\'s sad. What did Luke do? Assassination attempt, Trains Rey &amp; Commits Suicide. This is the movie he died in? Wow. Nothing Memorable. I still enjoyed the film &amp; thought it was fun, Kylo &amp; Rey vs the guards was choreographed well &amp; was the best scene in the movie. Luke in this film should\'ve been a carbon copy of Obi-Wan in Episode IV. The only way to make up for this is some type of "Days Of Future Past" time travel in the next film &amp; ERASE what happened in The Last Jedi. Give Mark Hamill a 5 minute Lightsaber battle vs Kylo Ren or a New Villain, have an old Chancellor get Assassinated in the beginning of Episode IX by a New villain &amp; at the end of the film, you find out this Rebel was the new villain, Now that sounds Compelling!</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Orlandoacevedo3"> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/950061950/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Orlando A</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 15, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="10"></span></div> A long and boring movie.

First off, the battle at the beginning and end are great. I thoroughly enjoyed them. Now for all the stuff in the middle. The majority of this movie is devoted to a slow speed chase, where the bad guy are literally just waiting for the good guys to run out of gas. Everything Poe Dameron does is literally pointless, and could have been avoided with one conversation between him and his superior. <br>Speaking of pointless, there is no reason for Finn to be in this movie. He goes off on his own adventure, that end in him failing his quest, but it doesn\'t matter because his quest wasn\'t necessary in the first place. <br> All Finn accomplished in the entire film is to free some space animals from captivity, but presumably they will just be re-captured. Are these animals important to the plot? No. Okay, moving on.<br> The big bad from the previous movie Snoke, is also revealed to be pointless, along with Luke, who Rey seeks out for training, but he decided not to train her.<br> In short, this movie seemed like a filler episode of a TV show, except instead of not movie the plot along it actually set the plot back from where it was last film.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="thad13"> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/963717105/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Thaddeus R</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 15, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="20"></span></div> Another mediocre Star Wars film with crappy plot writing and beautiful flashy effects.

That\'s not even the Last Jedi\'s biggest flaw; It suffers from a poorly developed story and subplots. Rian Johnson needed another writer to help him with this one. Also an overabundance of twists and shocks just for shocks sake.

I really don\'t understand what Rian Johnson is trying to do : destroying all coherence with the 8 previous movies (including Rogue one) ? Leia flying, Rey and Ben jedi skyping, Luke not even fighting... In addition to this massacre, the jokes are mocking the design of the space ships (like the flatiron one, come on)... A scenario that leads to no real evolution, no charisma from any character.
