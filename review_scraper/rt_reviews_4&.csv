Waited 2 hours to get the tickets so I would say that Im a fan. After episode 7 I was excited that this might turn out something good. I enjoyed TFA but its far from the best Star Wars movie. I had my hopes up to this one but it destroys everything 7 builds up and these movies ruins everything OT and prequels have done to this franchise. They should have kept George\'s story and someone else directing the movies. These new movies are missing the "Star Wars feeling" George\'s Star Wars had. There were good scenes but most of them was ruined with some stupid humour. This made my rating to from 3/5 to 1,5/5. In overall if you are an Star wars fan you will see all the bad and the couple of good things in this movie. If you are an average movie goer, not a fan who has seen the movies 391491 times you will enjoy the movie.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/832591234/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/1193291328/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/832591234/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Matthew R</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 15, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> To quote my son: "I really liked the reclining chairs and the button to move the seat."<br>This film should be hauled away as garbage as a disjointed uninteresting mess.<br>When I saw the original, I was given hope fun and a sense of adventure. NONE of those things exist here. If you are inclined to like the few lines of dialogue that are not somberly slow, then yes, it has a few lines of that - but this basically loses any fun from the original and now takes itself very seriously. I guess that\'s our age of deconstruction and a dark storyline.<br>From the first scene it proves it is a boring slow paced uninspiring dark sad mess with colloquial phrases (of course attack of the clones calling someone "Dad" started this trend), and reveals what a cash grab this film series has become. Disney has perfected the Pavlovian response and from the years of going to see films just to finish off a series and we all line up. I am done with this crap.<br>The film starts with starts with a childish insult fest between Poe and the Orders general. Really are they that childishly stupid? I guess so. Why not just send them an insulting twitter message?<br>The bomber crews slow strafe to the battleships and the fact that over 100 people disregarded direct orders to retreat show a lack of discipline and faith in their leaders. Leia has lost it, and it shows. <br>With the grabbing of a medallion which seems mystical but is not -- we are supposed to care that the moronic bombardier/gunner is dying and later her sister shows it as a connection. Just the fact that the character could not re-climb a ladder and is kicking the ladder to get a control is not heroic, but idiotic.<br>The next scene of Finn in a plastic bag leaking and NO ONE whom is running past gives a damn.<br>What the hell was that? Funny? No.<br>The fact that the rebellion even exists only shows how their entire cause is lost - the Republic fell in about 2 weeks - must be some crappy administration.<br>And their plan with 400 people is to run - yet as they get picked off, why didn\'t the order launch EVERY fighter form the half dozen destroyers chasing them?<br>Then when did Leia escape Krypton to learn to fly in space? Stupid.<br>Why can\'t we tell the head of the entire fighter wing what the plan is? Because. . .I don\'t know.<br>Don\'t tell the new Admiral of an idea to stop the tracking - that would make sense!<br>Luke as a bitter old man drinking a creature\'s milk is weird. Why leave a way to be found if you don\'t want to be?<br>I agree with him, throw the lightsaber, feh. He\'s done some am I.<br>Kylo Ren says it best, let it all die - Disney you are doing a great job of that.<br>How is it that Rey knows everything? In the original trilogy it takes 3 movies and time to learn Jedi things - here, 10 minutes. <br>Porgs, which are not named, why are they there? I don\'t know.<br>I could feel the coldness of the production form that Irish isle myself in the slow pacing.<br>The laziness is also apparent - there is the fight scene in Jedi and the assault on Hoth. And that throne room - if it was any more poorly designed you could have shown the backlot - a red screen. I don\'t get these story choice in the least - it is so recycled it hurts.<br>The casino scene was entirely unnecessary. In fact, think a moment - if they could escape with miniships in multiple directions at light speed, why didn\'t they? And again pandering to babies and children the end scene of a kid using a force power to grab a broom looking up to the stars. That\'s not hope or marketing - it\'s whining.<br>And as for the rebels - run out of gas and get picked up one by one.<br>The fact that no one answers the rebels distress call only show everyone has moved on -- so should we all.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="William D."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977055183/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> William D</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span>\xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 15, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="45"></span></div> I loved that this Star Wars film had actual meat on its bones, it really explored and commented on the nature of good and evil, not like it\'s previous films which assumed the nature of good and evil.

WTF was Disney thinking with this? The Last Jedi is a total dumpster fire of a mess - filled with over the top humor and lame gags, preachy political and social commentary, and completely lame characters in asisnine situations. I\'ll say the visuals were impressive and the music was fine (even though it seemed like John Williams just rehashed his entire line up from Empire Strikes Back). <br><br>All in all: This was NOT the Star Wars I was looking for. Disney should be ashamed of making such a ridiculous mockery of Star Wars. Wake up Disney! You gave me some hope after Rogue One, but this... ???

It breaks the white hat/black hat/light side/dark side formula that we\'ve come to expect. This is not another movie from my or your childhood. That, perhaps, is the problem for a vocal minority of fans who don\'t like TLJ. Without risking spoilers, characters in TLJ do not act as we expect Star Wars heroes and villains to act. Instead of god-like and faultless heroes, we get failure and disappointment. The villains falter. Just keep in mind that one of if not the most important themes in Star Wars is redemption after the fall. This movie is filled with a lot of the latter and a bit of the former. Failure: dwell upon that notion and think about all of the Jedi masters we have encountered. Remember also that this is the middle of this trilogy\'s arc and that the heroes we see are not written as gilded statues but as real people with real flaws.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/956802747/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/100000494541872/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/956802747/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Chris B</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 15, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> Doesn\'t deserve to have the Star Wars title.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/935224880/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/100001409310593/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/935224880/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Oth\xf3n Daniel L</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 15, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="20"></span></div> It\'s the worst Star Wars movie to date; with a couple of memorable moments and too much progressive agenda.

I am very disappointed that the producers, writers, and director have ignored what suggestions Mark Hamill had for Luke Skywalker. It seems these days that the "new" talent in Hollywood is more about making money while disrespecting and neglecting the fans and the talented actors who created the roles decades ago. There was so much taken from the Empire Strikes Back and The Return of the Jedi that I was wondering why this film was being billed as something new and exciting. I think what has happened is the new kids want to be PC and change all of the things about Star Wars to appeal to everyone and make as mush money as they can before moving on to ruin more films.

I tried really hard to look for something redeeming, but thelonger it went on the more annoyed I became. I can picture arguments in the back room between Disney and the Director/Writers with Disney winning of course. I\'m having a hard time thinking of this crap as "Star Wars" as it doesn\'t feel the same and the story line and characters are just not that interetsing.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/901870926/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/1518071817/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/901870926/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Thomas H</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span>\xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 15, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="15"></span></div> The Last Jedi...otherwise known as "it just doesn\'t matter".<br><br> I\'m a huge Star Wars fanboy and I walked out of Last Jedi and the best thing I could say about it was "Well, it wasn\'t horrible"...and I felt like "Well everything about the movie was trying hard, but why wasn\'t LJ good?"... it took a few hours but it all distills down to this..." Nothing matters anymore" Last Jedi makes all the events of all the previous Star Wars movies not matter and says to the fans " everything you want to know about the new characters just doesn\'t matter "<br><br>...Were you intrigued about Snoke? "Well it just won\'t matter"<br>...Want to know who Rey\'s parents are? "Well, it just won\'t matter"<br>...Want more Phasma? "Well, it just won\'t matter" <br><br>Some other observations and questions...<br><br>...Why introduce Holdo to throw her away? Why not give her entire arc to Admiral Ackbar! It would of given a classic character more screen time and send him off in noble fashion! to obvious maybe? God forbid.<br>...Luke Skywalker threw in the towel and would rather let the whole galaxy fall to darkness? Really? REALLY? way to plant a turd right on top of the original trilogy.<br>...Why not use the canon method of "anti-lightspeed" by giving Snokes ship "intredictor" tech?. Too old school?<br>...Poe is a traitor that can\'t follow orders and literally gets off the hook by being cute...really? He should of sat in the brig the whole movie or even better-dead.<br>..The alliance bombers? why not just use B-wings? oh wait, gotta have new lego sets.<br>..And Star Wars has a serious vehicle "size creep" issue...Smaller and faster is good too...<br><br>The questions and issues just go on and on with this movie...<br><br>Imagine if you will Ruby Rhod reading off a list of everything you want to know about Star Wars and then lighting that list on fire with an over the top "But who cares!"<br><br>The whole "chase the command ship" felt like Battlestar Galactica, the Finn/Casino story line was in fact a complete and total waste of time as it went nowhere without a single plot ramification...except to preach at you and del Toro? over-hyped would be doing the term a disservice. Also what in the world was up with some of the dialog ..."Godspeed"? really? The scenes that worked or were nicely shot could not carry the weight of what fell flat and the last scene...oh man is that a Disney commercial... When all is said and done though it is still better than the all the prequels combined but that is not a high bar to jump.. I was hoping Last jedi would make me excited for what was to come but now I have more then a little trepidation about what Ruin Johnson will do with his trilogy.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Jeremy D."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977055027/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Jeremy D</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 15, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="10"></span></div> JJ Abrams is doing a great job destroying Star Wars for everyone.
