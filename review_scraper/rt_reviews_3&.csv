I can\'t stand bad writing( i.e. Rey as a Mery Sue) as well as I can\'t stand blatant, blunt SJW/feminist propaganda and the fact, that for producers that political message was more important, than telling a good story. Only what they care about is money, but not quality. Propaganda and resenitment over Trump election is more important for them, over universal message and respect of legacy. Message of TLJ, and TFA as well, by the way, was political, wrong, and makes those movies very soon outdated, propably. What they wanted is an empowering feminist fantasy, but since they lack of creativity, they hijacked broadly beloved franchise, destroying it as "outdated relict of patriarchal dominance" and, on its ruins/corpse/remains, build their propaganda piece!

Ignore all the bad fan reviews its great!" End quote.<br><br>?? WTF ...seriously ? Tell us why it is so good? Did you see the same movie the rest of us did?<br><br>William D ( 4&amp;1/2 stars) "I loved that this Star Wars film had actual meat on its bones, it really explored and commented on the nature of good and evil, not like it\'s previous films which assumed the nature of good and evil. I thought the acting was great, the script was fun and illuminating, the action up to par. Not sure what folks are upset about, The Last Jedi is a fine film, as good as the last." End quote<br><br>WTF ?! The script was fun ? The script as you mention, was all over the place, nonsensical ( fact, not my opinion but fact) And had no conetion to the timeline of the previous movie.<br><br><br>Fiachra H ( 5 stars) "Star Wars finally grows up." End quote<br>Wow...this tells people so much. in what way exactly ? If you lov e it so much, I am calling you out on it. WTF has it merrited to deserve 5 stars ? You wrote the review, tell us why , in your opinion it is a 5 star movie, enlighten us please. <br><br>GL ( 5 stars) Kept me guessing all the way. Delivered on every point. For the record I am the age that as a child I saw the original Star Wars when it first came out ". End quote.<br><br>Ok.... in what way ? In what light can you say with the plot holes, errors that by keeping you guessing earns a 5 star.<br><br><br>Dave H ( 5stars) January 15, 2018<br>The Last Jedi is the most complex story we have seen to date in the Star Wars saga. It breaks the white hat/black hat/light side/dark side formula that we\'ve come to expect. This is not another movie from my or your childhood. That, perhaps, is the problem for a vocal minority of fans who don\'t like TLJ. Without risking spoilers, characters in TLJ do not act as we expect Star Wars heroes and villains to act. Instead of god-like and faultless heroes, we get failure and disappointment. The villains falter. Just keep in mind that one of if not the most important themes in Star Wars is redemption after the fall. This movie is filled with a lot of the latter and a bit of the former. Failure: dwell upon that notion and think about all of the Jedi masters we have encountered. Remember also that this is the middle of this trilogy\'s arc and that the heroes we see are not written as gilded statues but as real people with real flaws." End quote<br><br>????? WTF !! You do not make any sense, sorry. God like faultless heros? Um...did you note see the movie with Rey in it ? She is more a god now than...god. She has no faults, and knows everything. jedi in the past needed training..rey. hell no, training is for nerds or other people. failure?\' I assume you aretalking about Luke. Luke failed a lot, in training and similar in the past, Go back and see some of the other movies or red some of the books. The complex story you mention is complex only in how much it falters and fails.<br><br><br>I agree with Neil M and Albert B about some of the RT people posting high stars and with no explanation why. people hating the film are not only saying " it sucked 1/2 star...they are going into fucking point, by popint detail. <br><br>The movie is a travesty<br><br>I am sharing a quote.<br>Here is the quote by Albert B. All that he is commented on is right on the money.<br>BEGIN QUOTE...<br><br>"I have to be honest and say the people on RT writing a review saying " wow best movie ever! " or similar, and giving 4 or 5 stars.... why dont you take the time to write what you think is so good about this trash movie? the bulk of people that do not like it are doing that. When all you can do is say " great movie loved it! " you look like a troll. List the points of the movie you liked. The rest of us, the majority did not like it and can list point by point why.<br><br>Some glaring things I found insulted my inteligence or tossed out old star wars lore.<br><br>1) C3P0... from TFA to TLJ the timeline is only a few days, maybe a week from the destruction of the first oder star killer. The resistance / rebelion is under sige... but in all this chaos... someone decided to find C3P0 a new matching arm ? ( arm was red in TFA ) This was more important than...I dont know....suriving the battles with the first order ? " Oh my god were going to die ! But...wait ! C3P0 !....I know your left arm is ok, and it functions... but I cant stand the color....go down to maintence and get a new one to match your other arm! " Is this what has happened amidst all the chaos ??<br><br>2) As has been noted, the humor was stupid, Hux and Poe the telephone call was idiotic, and after that you could not take any of the first order officers as serious characters.<br><br>3) The timeline for TLJ is only a few days from when the resistance destroyed the first order starKiller base from TFA..... in that time the resistance has become a shadow of its former self, no support, no money, no people, no ships....nada. They have been fighting for 40 years, saved the galaxy from Darth Vader, the Emperor, they destroyed 2 death stars and the first order planet killer ....and have no support from the galaxy of people they have been saving " oh yeah, thanks for keeping my planet from being blown up... money ? ...support?? ... yeah...well you know times are tough..sorry cant help you... " At the end of the movie...the resistance now..less 400 people, no ships, no nada...and to hide behind a big metal door the great plan was to send out a message begging for help....seriously ? If no one wanted to help the resistance at its best, no one would be coming when they are at their worst.<br><br>Just 100% shit writing, lazy writing.<br><br>4) Rose and Fin. Underdevoped characters brought in ..it seems for comic relief. Casino planet was a complete waste of time.<br><br>5) The force now....teaches you everthing you need to know. Training ??! Who the fuck needs training ?! Not Rey she know everything, including how to best a jedi master ! And not the kid at the end of the movie moving his broom in ways that took Aniken years to master !<br><br>6) Luke...the man that can find good in Darth Vader, spare his life... now at a moment of weakness....is going to kill his nephew, his sisters and best friends son...because he has dark thoughts...? Did the idiot writer not read a book, or see any of the previous movies ? What ? This is good writing ? this is good character developement ? This is ...new ? it is beyond stupid.<br><br>7) Leia....never using the force for anything, cant use the force to find Luke....but in one moment when she is sucked into the vacume of space, can become the most powerful jedi or sith that has ever lived before or since? Wow... more shit writing, just for have a extra movie subplot? Or what?<br><br>8) Snoke.... dont know where he came from, how he took over power, who trained him...nada. There is no mention of his name in any of the previous movies, books, cartoons nothing. A character with no backstory, killed off.<br><br>9) Yoda, now is almost a god. He can command lighting to destroy things. Where the fuck was he, if he was so powerful to give Luke some tutoring when he was teaching his students?\' Where was Obi Wan ? They let him fuck up with his students, and basicaly from that mistake the first order rises up.... and ..they leave him a lone in his depression on the island... But ! Yoda decides to come out of ...hiding ? And tell Luke the old jedi books are no longer important, and uses the force to burn the old books ? Seriously ?<br><br>10) The Knights of Ren are....where ? Anyone know ?<br><br>11) Kylo Ren and Fin, at the end of TFA are both very injured, now, a few days later in TLJ... they are ok ?<br><br>12) sub plots with no point, misplaced humor, no character development or very poor use of characters. Captain Phasma..what a waste.<br><br>13) Social messages...... we need this in a star wars movie ? Men are evil, or stupid or both. Rich people are all bad and cant be trusted...? This last part I find almost funny, coming from people like Kathleen Kennedy and the Disney executives...these people make more in 1 week than most people will see in 5 lifetimes... but, obviosly they do not consider themselves as rich / wealthy.<br><br>I can go one and on, and on, as to why this movie is so terrible, just as so many other people have. it is a shit movie, on its own it is a shit movie, as a star wars movie it is a disgrace.<br><br>If you are making comments...and if somehow you feel this movie is good, and seriously worth more than 1 star ....for fuck sake tell all of us that cant stant this movie, why you liked it.<br><br>Dont be a troll to try to push up the rating on RT, it makes you look like a complete fool. if you have time to make a positive review, then you have time to write point by point and explain why<br><br>I give 1/2 a star for good visuals and music, the rest of the movie is trash."<br><br>End Quote.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="foxxpix"> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/965144127/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> FoxxPix P</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 15, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> This is totally stupid!

TLJ is paradoxically too clever for its own good and also profoundly stupid. A few visual masterstrokes can\'t redeem glaring plot holes or shallow, underdeveloped characters. <br><br>The ruination of once-beloved icon Luke Skywalker is unforgivable, especially in the service of a lazy low-stakes story. If a franchise feels compelled to destroy a cherished character it should at least be for a believable reason, not because the writer\'s a creatively-bankrupt nihilist. <br><br>Throughout this insipid slog writer/director Rian Johnson exhibits sneering contempt for the audience, the franchise, and every single one of his [vastly superior] creative predecessors.

About "fanboys": Don\'t dismiss them. Star Wars created fanboys and fanboys are largely responsible for creating the Star Wars blockbuster phenomenon that has lasted for over 40 years. I was 10 years old when Star Wars (A New Hope) first hit theaters, and up to now its goodwill has carried me through, many times groaning (especially with the prequels), but never perturbed as I am now. As I suspect it may be for many, the Last Jedi is the last straw. <br><br>Maybe it is a conscious act by Rian Johnson to kill the past. He certainly seems to be enamored with his own genius in "giving us the Star Wars we needed" as opposed to what we wanted. It seems, however, that he was so busy trying to subvert expectations that he failed to produce a coherent script. Ultimately, Johnson opted to throw the baby out with the bathwater, summarily dismissing 40 years of Star Wars legacy and lore to prove his own brilliance in giving us something unexpected and new. Well, my expectation that the movie would at least honor the Star Wars legacy was certainly subverted, and it appears that many, many people feel the same way. Johnson, Kathleen Kennedy and the TPTB at Disney should not be surprised if by "killing the past" they also end up killing the goodwill the brand has carried for decades. <br><br>B) WTF plot points that haven\'t been discussed enough:<br>The story is essentially two battles book-ending Rey\'s long weekend with grumpy grandpa Luke, with everybody else literally trying to keep busy until that is out of the way. And the best Johnson could come up with is a slow chase in space? I, as many other people have, wonder whether he ever saw a Star Wars movie before. Its not just the fanboys and geeks in this camp either, as his script defies basic logic on its own. Set aside that this chase takes place in an established universe where hyperspace travel exists and ships have different speed and weapons capabilities - the absurdity of it all is still highlighted by inconsistent developments in the plot. To wit: <br><br>So Admiral Holdo\'s big, top secret plan is to limp along until they can all sneak out on transports, go to Crait and use the base to call their friends for help. And in the middle of this, Poe calls Maz Kanata, a known friend of the Resistance, without anyone on his own ship let alone the First Order being the wiser... <br><br>OK, maybe Maz was too busy with her union troubles to forward a message, but did Leia or Holdo not at least contemplate trying to get on the horn with someone they knew? Instead, they sit on their hands while Finn and Rose go on their excellent adventure for 18 hours, using a transport to hyper jump away - again without anyone on their own ship or the FO even noticing... <br><br>Hey, maybe Leia or Holdo or someone else with some juice could have gone to Canto Bight or somewhere to use a pay phone there. Or better yet, they could have tried to get as many VIPs out on all those other transports, that are capable of hyper space travel and no one seems to notice...<br><br>Except for DJ. Who somehow knows Holdo\'s plan, even though the only people from the Resistance he has met are Rose and Finn, who wouldn\'t have been there in the first place if they were in any way privy to said plan... <br><br>PURE, LOGIC DEFYING GARBAGE. <br><br>Follow DJ\'s advice - don\'t join in this nonsense.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977055256/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/331255740709428/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977055256/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 15, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> The Last Jedi has killed the whole Star Wars series for me from here on out. The plot is full of holes, lame attempts at humor, and is yet another one time great thing ruined by political correctness/SJW nonsense messaging. Really sad flick, and a waste of my money and time. A bad end (for me) to a series that began as a really uplifting and fun series of stories.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="gabe g."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977030633/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> gabe g</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 15, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="30"></span></div> i love it the story was amzing but rose sucked and everything else was awsome exept for the superman scene</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="James B."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977055199/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> James B</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 15, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="10"></span></div> Top 10 Things We Know After Watching Star Wars: The Last Jedi...<br><br>1. Released Dec 2017. Any critic giving a positive review because a film is \'visually stunning\' should be ASHAMED. This isn\'t 1993\'s Jurassic Park. This is 2017/18. We can make CGI stormtroopers on our phones!<br>2. Disney decided to use multiple directors for a Star Wars trilogy (seemingly without the two communicating), because continuity in storyline, character development, and overall theme is just boring...<br>3. There is now gravity in space! Resistance fighters have to DROP bombs directly over the First Order ships, and ships slow down when they run out of fuel. Obviously, long ago in a galaxy far away the vacuum of space had gravity.<br>4. Slap stick comedy is now rampant in the Star Wars Universe. Return of the Jedi can now be digitally remastered again!! The force ghosts appearing at the celebration after the Battle of Endor can be played by Larry, Curly, and Mo!<br>5. John Williams still has it! One star for John Williams.<br>6. People can survive the vacuum of space! When opening the bomb bays of the WWII style bomber ships, and when sucked out of an exploded bridge of a resistance ship in the worst Peter Panning moment in cinematic history people survive in space. I mean, space has gravity so it might as well have atmosphere as well..<br>7. "This is Hollywood. No one cares if a move is good as long as it makes money!" --Mark Hamill <br>8. This film did have editors\' names listed in the credits. No one is really sure what they actually did, though...<br>9. Star Wars has produced the largest fan base of any movie series--one that has spanned 40 years, three generations, and made billions in merchandise sales. Disney and this director who shall not be named decided to \'kill the past\' and \'go in a different direction\', because, wait......Why did they do that?<br>10. The audience has spoken. Ep. 8 is the worst Star Wars move ever! As annoying as Jar Jar Binks was, Ep. 1 brought us a terrific Jedi scene. The Last Jedi has no redeeming qualities.</div> </div> </div>']
