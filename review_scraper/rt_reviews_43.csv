From the beginning there were strong female characters and people of color. What made those original movies so good however were the writing, acting, and revolutionary production. I felt like Force Awakens had that as well, and although stylized and sleek to the point where it seems to lose some magic, it still managed to bridge all the worlds together and still be interesting. This movie seemed like it was written by 10 people who were not communicating with one another, the movie then taped together and white-washed with random lessons about meat being wrong, capitalism being bad, males being weak and awful, and something about horse racing? This would have been completely OK if there were also a plot to go with it. But there wasn\'t. Instead we saw a slow speed chase throughout the film that made no sense and could have been avoided by warping in front of the target or sending tie fighters around the target. Luke Skywalker is Mel Gibson now. Finn exists only to be saved by Rey, who without training is magically the most powerful person in the galaxy, and Kylo is a confused teenager who can\'t stop losing at everything. And who was Snoak? No one knows and it doesn\'t matter because he never learned about how to safely point a light saber away from you. I always thought light saber safety was like force 101 but Snoak slept through that lesson. Also a physically dead character is still alive. So good luck with all of that JJ. I think Rian Johnson really screwed you here. You\'re Lukeless and Snoakless and somehow you have to figure out what to do with a dead actor that is still somehow alive in your movie. Also, unless you one-up Johnson and make the new god-emperor of the rebellion ultra diverse you\'re going to get hash-tagged. I gave this movie two stars, because there were,sort of, light sabers in it.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977047521/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/10215519032913207/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977047521/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="10"></span></div> Lack of writer continuity in this trilogy makes for a lackluster experience.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977047506/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/1221568234654844/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977047506/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span>\xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="15"></span></div> finn and rose side mission was terrible, the forced humour was terrible, snoke is just a terrible villain like terrible, and luke\'s death sucked.

People have done a good job deconstructing this movie and pointing its flaws, esp. with how they dealt with Luke, but I have something to add with regard to Rey.<br><br>The most important friendship established in TFA was Rey and Finn\'s. Remember how devastated Rey was when she thought Finn was dead or had a chance of dying? Remember Rey calling Kylo a "monster" after he killed Han, the only father figure she\'d ever had? <br><br>Well all of that doesn\'t matter anymore. It\'s heavily implied that Rey and Kylo have a thing for each other in TLJ. Imagine developing romantic feelings with someone who, just last week, intentionally wounded and almost kills your first, life-long, and childhood best friend. Imagine developing romantic feelings for someone who just murdered your father, a day after you called him a murderer. Remember, this is the Rey who screamed out Finn\'s name like he was her only friend (he was) when he was getting entangled by the Rathtars. This is the Rey got all teary-eyed at even the thought of Finn\'s leaving her and the Resistance to flee.<br><br>Is Rey an amnesiac? Rian Johnson shows utter disrespect to both Finn and Rey, and esp. to their friendship. Their friendship is now reduced to worthlessness. The same with her relationship with Han. What does Finn\'s and Han\'s friendship mean to Rey? NOT MUCH AT ALL in light of all this.<br><br>Now you might argue that Rey, because she is the paradigm of hope, would always see the best in people and so would hope that Kylo would turn from his evil ways. They even have some things in common, two powerful wielders of the force n all (tho for some reason she is way stronger than him already, just look at the throne room scene). But still. You\'re telling me she\'s getting all horny for this guy who just did these things to these people? BS. Rey would be more loyal to her friends and family than that.<br><br>To top all this off, Rian Johnson portrays her attraction to Kylo as a *good* thing. Lolol. Not even as in any way bad. Remember: Luke stumbles in upon them force skyping in the hut as if they\'re doing a terrible thing, but Luke is presented as the intrusive one and the one at fault (Rey immediately lays into him). The morals are just so ass-backwards in this story. Poe is portrayed as the clown while Admiral Holdo plans an \'escape\' but doesn\'t tell her top troops what she\'s planning to do, leading to a well-deserved coup. And then she has the audacity to wait until 90% of the Resistance is dead before she does her all-too-late kamikaze. Ugh. Amazing how a movie can retroactively make a previous movie\'s most important friendships and character development worse and meaningless.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977047471/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/1817280018291300/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977047471/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> R tomatoes refreshed while review was being written.

The film offered the writer/director a once-in-infinity opportunity to create the return of Luke Skywalker, and we get... milking an alien? It was the ruination of Luke Skywalker. Can anyone really think this is the best they could do? Lucasfilm had to expect a vehemently negative reaction to Luke\'s storyline. This truly was an anti-Star Wars movie. The storylines for Fin and Poe were totally forgettable. They were useless digressions within digressions in which the characters seemingly fought to make themselves relevant to the movie. The casino was a royale flop. The CGI on that planet and in the fight scenes inside the First Order\'s ships looked unreal and were frequently inane. Vice Admiral Holdo? Lousy. Celeb cameos? In Star Wars? Seriously, that\'s trash. Return of Phasma? Lazy. Her role was fine for Force Awakens but she\'s just a shiny souped up stormtrooper. That\'s a limited use character. She\'s done. Move on. Make up a new villainous character, please. You\'ve got the artists and budget to do so. Snoke was a pathetic villain with no gravitas. Since they never bothered to build up his story, I\'m not going to bother to say more about him. That said, the New Republic must\'ve been even more pathetic to get so easily rolled by the likes of Smoke. Kylo Ren is a lightweight. Where\'s the beef? Then there\'s Leia Poppins. She deserved better, too. Yoda and Chewbacca were among the occasional highlights, even managing to be delightful. Rey was also a bright side. The film did start to pick up in the 3rd act and almost seemed like it could come together. For all its myriad faults, the movie could have redeemed itself with a storyline worthy of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. And in that it failed and the entire movie failed. Throw the writer/director to the Sarlacc. Throw K Kennedy to the Rancor. Toss the rest of Lucasfilm into the Death Star trash compactor -- along with every last DVD or Blu Ray copy of the Last Jedi.

Writer/director Rian Johnson seems to understand these thematic elements that have lifted the collective imaginations of fans for decades by challenging what we know (or at least what we think we know), yet giving us a new lens to view them in satisfying and surprising ways and has also given us an excellent Star Wars film that can proudly confirm that the Sequel Trilogy are in good hands. The best looking Star Wars film made (to date), Johnson\'s cinematic eye is the perfect match for this space opera, delivering lush spectacle to add to the franchise\'s many iconic moments. But Star Wars is more than beautiful scenery and space battles (which this has) and the most vital aspect that makes these worth watching is the story and characters, which Johnson has confidently delivered on. Picking up where J.J. Abrams\' 2015 The Force Awakens left us, Johnson has delivered a middle chapter that is darker in tone and narrative (similar to 1980s The Empire Strikes Back, the go-to map for a sequel) that challenges our new cast (Daisy Ridley\'s Rey, John Boyega\'s Finn, Oscar Isacc\'s Poe and Adam Driver\'s Kylo... with some new faces) as well as the old (Mark Hamill\'s Luke and the late Carrie Fisher\'s Leia), ultimately enriching them in character and drive that will make Episode IX\'s finale something to look forward to. For all the success that Johnson pours from the Star Wars well into Episode VIII, there are some wobbles here and there (that may remind some of the failure that is the Prequels) but as a whole, The Last Jedi is a satisfying, character-driven lesson in franchise filmmaking that many should learn from.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/948358294/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/1660352875/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/948358294/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Edward B</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> WHY DOES ROTTEN TOMATOES ONLY SHOW POSITIVE AUDIENCE REVIEWS FOR THIS ON THEIR FRONT PAGE WHEN THE MAJORITY OF REVIEWS AFTER THAT ARE MOSTLY NEGATIVE?

Everyday this country hits a new low, something like this comes along and no one even notices.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/977047420/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/10100865862247039/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977047420/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> </span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 11, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> I created an account just to review this tripe.

Don\'t see it you\'ll waist 2 and a half hours of your life that you can\'t get back.</div> </div> </div>']
