This is a Disney piece of shit. Thank you Disney for successfully turning the Star Wars franchise into a new Transformers franchise. Filled with dumb, cringe worthy, pathetic, un-funny one liners. There are so many things going on with so many different characters, everyone is screaming for air time, and the small amount they are given is lack lustre. There is no continuation from The Force Awakens and the plot takes you on an illogical roller coaster ride, jumping from one scene to another, just to leave the last one hanging by a thread full of unanswered questions. Too many scenes were unnecessary and the entire lore of the Star Wars universe is replaced with something I cannot even explain. It lets you down, and keeps you down in the dumps from start to finish. Different writer, different story. Don\'t expect a Star Wars film, expect a Disney fantasy.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <a class="" href="/user/id/785858170/"><img src="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/512186694/picture" width="50" height="50"></a></div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/785858170/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Daniel N</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 12, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="20"></span></div> Disappointing.

There is SO much going on, so much jibber-jabber, but at the end of the day, nothing is really happening. As you may have heard, Luke is almost like an entirely new character. I guess hes been jaded by his island isolation, but come on.... this is so stupid... he shares literally zero character traits with the Luke we knew from the original trilogy. <br><br>New Jedi Girl= Doo-doo butter<br><br>Her little friend from the first movie, Finn= Doo-Doo Butter<br><br>Old-Guy Luke= Doo-Doo Butter<br><br>Ghost Yoda= Doo-Doo Butter<br><br>Oh yeah, and one more thing.

Turned him into some grumpy old tit-milking weirdo.<br><br>The whole casino thing. How can Disney a multi-billion dollar organisation spend half a film on lecturing the public on why making money is bad.<br><br>They even put a purple haired feminist in just to fill the diversity quota...talk about projecting your insecurities.<br><br>Poor Finn, was the janitor of the Death Star now he\'s just looking for a plot arc and when he gets to finally get to do something and sacrifice himself for his fellow rebels...another diversity hire Rose stops him from having a big send off and mutters these immortal words "that\'s how we\'re gonna win. Not fighting what we hate, saving what we love." - that makes no sense and our cinema burst out laughing.<br><br>So many plot holes ..... who writes this crap.<br><br>The only reason I\'ll give it half a star was for some of the special effects which I thought were well done.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Jack P."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977048468/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Jack P</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> \xbd</span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 12, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="05"></span></div> Literally worst star wars film to date, ,cannnot believe this made it to the screen, complete and utter trash.</div> </div> </div>', u'<div class="row review_table_row"> <div class="col-xs-8"> <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-15 critic_img"> <img src="https://d2a5cgar23scu2.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/actor.default.tmb.gif" width="50" height="50" class="media_block_image" alt="Gerhard%20 O."> </div> <div class="col-sm-7 col-xs-9 top_critic col-sm-push-13 superreviewer"> </div> <div class="col-sm-11 col-xs-24 col-sm-pull-4"> <a class="bold unstyled articleLink" href="/user/id/977048461/"><span style="word-wrap:break-word"> Gerhard%20 O</span> </a></div> </div> <div class="col-xs-16"> <span style="color:#F1870A" class="fl"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span> <span class="fr small subtle">January 12, 2018</span> <div class="user_review" style="display:inline-block; width:100%"> <div class="scoreWrapper"><span class="10"></span></div> Storyline just awfull.

Don\'t listen to the "professional critics", they are liars and panderers. Looking for points so Disney can treat them right and get invited to premieres. The BEST reviews come from people who have nothing financial to gain from giving a film a good review.</div> </div> </div>']
